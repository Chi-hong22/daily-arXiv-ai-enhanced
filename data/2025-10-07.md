### [1] [SoC-DT: Standard-of-Care Aligned Digital Twins for Patient-Specific Tumor Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03287)
*Moinak Bhattacharya,Gagandeep Singh,Prateek Prasanna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SoC-DT框架，结合反应-扩散肿瘤生长模型和标准治疗方案，通过可微分求解器预测治疗后肿瘤结构，在合成和真实胶质瘤数据上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反应-扩散模型无法捕捉异质性治疗方案下的肿瘤动态，需要能真实模拟标准治疗方案并考虑患者个体差异的计算框架。

Method: 开发SoC-DT可微分框架，统一反应-扩散肿瘤生长模型、离散标准治疗干预（手术、化疗、放疗）以及基因组和人口统计学个性化；提出IMEX-SoC隐式-显式指数时间差分求解器确保稳定性。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界胶质瘤数据评估中，SoC-DT在预测肿瘤动态方面持续优于经典PDE基线和纯数据驱动的神经模型。

Conclusion: SoC-DT通过将机制可解释性与现代可微分求解器相结合，为肿瘤学中患者特异性数字孪生建立了原则性基础，实现生物学一致的肿瘤动态估计。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of tumor trajectories under standard-of-care (SoC)
therapies remains a major unmet need in oncology. This capability is essential
for optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression.
Conventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to
capture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is
hence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically
simulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in
genomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care
Digital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies
reaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization
to predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit
exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures
stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated
on both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently
outperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in
predicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern
differentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for
patient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent
tumor dynamics estimation. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

### [2] [Visualizing Celebrity Dynamics in Video Content: A Proposed Approach Using Face Recognition Timestamp Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03292)
*Doğanay Demir,İlknur Durgar Elkahlout*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个结合分布式多GPU推理系统和交互式可视化平台的混合框架，用于分析视频中名人动态，通过高效处理大规模视频数据生成时间戳记录，并提供多种可视化图表来揭示名人出现模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频内容主导的时代，理解视频结构和动态变得越来越重要，需要高效处理大规模视频数据并提供直观的分析工具。

Method: 使用优化的ONNX模型、异构批量推理和高吞吐量并行化构建分布式多GPU推理系统，生成时间戳出现记录，然后通过交互式可视化平台展示多种分析图表。

Result: 系统能够高效处理大规模视频数据，生成全面的可视化分析，包括出现频率、时长分析、共现矩阵、网络图等，揭示名人突出度、屏幕时间分布、时间动态等模式。

Conclusion: 通过将分布式识别与结构化可视化分析相结合，为娱乐分析、内容创作策略和观众参与研究开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: In an era dominated by video content, understanding its structure and
dynamics has become increasingly important. This paper presents a hybrid
framework that combines a distributed multi-GPU inference system with an
interactive visualization platform for analyzing celebrity dynamics in video
episodes. The inference framework efficiently processes large volumes of video
data by leveraging optimized ONNX models, heterogeneous batch inference, and
high-throughput parallelism, ensuring scalable generation of timestamped
appearance records. These records are then transformed into a comprehensive
suite of visualizations, including appearance frequency charts, duration
analyses, pie charts, co-appearance matrices, network graphs, stacked area
charts, seasonal comparisons, and heatmaps. Together, these visualizations
provide multi-dimensional insights into video content, revealing patterns in
celebrity prominence, screen-time distribution, temporal dynamics,
co-appearance relationships, and intensity across episodes and seasons. The
interactive nature of the system allows users to dynamically explore data,
identify key moments, and uncover evolving relationships between individuals.
By bridging distributed recognition with structured, visually-driven analytics,
this work enables new possibilities for entertainment analytics, content
creation strategies, and audience engagement studies.

### [3] [Domain-Robust Marine Plastic Detection Using Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03294)
*Saanvi Kataria*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多种深度学习模型在水下塑料垃圾跨域检测中的性能，发现轻量级CNN模型MobileNetV2在跨域泛化方面表现最佳，而零样本模型CLIP和Gemini各有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋塑料污染是紧迫的环境威胁，需要可靠的水下垃圾自动检测系统。但由于域偏移问题，在一个数据集上训练的系统在新图像上性能会下降。

Method: 在标记的水下数据集上训练CNN（MobileNetV2、ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0）和视觉变换器（DeiT-Tiny、ViT-B16），然后在来自不同来源的跨域测试集上评估。同时评估了零样本模型CLIP ViT-L14和Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Result: 轻量级MobileNetV2提供最强的跨域性能（F1 0.97），超越更大模型。所有微调模型都实现了高精度（约99%），但在召回率上存在差异。零样本CLIP敏感但易产生假阳性，而Gemini则相反。

Conclusion: 具有监督训练的紧凑CNN能有效泛化用于跨域水下检测，而大型预训练视觉语言模型提供互补优势。

Abstract: Marine plastic pollution is a pressing environmental threat, making reliable
automation for underwater debris detection essential. However, vision systems
trained on one dataset often degrade on new imagery due to domain shift. This
study benchmarks models for cross-domain robustness, training convolutional
neural networks - CNNs (MobileNetV2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (DeiT-Tiny, ViT-B16) on a labeled underwater dataset and then
evaluates them on a balanced cross-domain test set built from plastic-positive
images drawn from a different source and negatives from the training domain.
Two zero-shot models were assessed, CLIP ViT-L14 and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash,
that leverage pretraining to classify images without fine-tuning. Results show
the lightweight MobileNetV2 delivers the strongest cross-domain performance (F1
0.97), surpassing larger models. All fine-tuned models achieved high Precision
(around 99%), but differ in Recall, indicating varying sensitivity to plastic
instances. Zero-shot CLIP is comparatively sensitive (Recall around 80%) yet
prone to false positives (Precision around 56%), whereas Gemini exhibits the
inverse profile (Precision around 99%, Recall around 81%). Error analysis
highlights recurring confusions with coral textures, suspended particulates,
and specular glare. Overall, compact CNNs with supervised training can
generalize effectively for cross-domain underwater detection, while large
pretrained vision-language models provide complementary strengths.

### [4] [Multimodal Arabic Captioning with Interpretable Visual Concept Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03295)
*Passant Elchafei,Amany Fashwan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLCAP是一个阿拉伯语图像描述框架，结合CLIP视觉标签检索与多模态文本生成，通过可解释的阿拉伯视觉概念生成文化连贯的阿拉伯语图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端图像描述方法缺乏可解释性，VLCAP旨在通过基于视觉概念检索的方法，生成更具文化连贯性和上下文准确性的阿拉伯语图像描述。

Method: 使用三种多语言编码器(mCLIP、AraCLIP、Jina V4)进行视觉标签检索，构建包含训练描述和约21K通用领域标签的混合词汇表，然后将检索到的标签转换为阿拉伯语提示，输入到视觉语言模型(Qwen-VL和Gemini Pro Vision)进行描述生成。

Result: mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision组合在BLEU-1(5.34%)和余弦相似度(60.01%)上表现最佳，而AraCLIP + Qwen-VL在LLM-judge评分(36.33%)上最高。

Conclusion: VLCAP的可解释流水线能够生成文化连贯且上下文准确的阿拉伯语图像描述，为阿拉伯语多模态任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present VLCAP, an Arabic image captioning framework that integrates
CLIP-based visual label retrieval with multimodal text generation. Rather than
relying solely on end-to-end captioning, VLCAP grounds generation in
interpretable Arabic visual concepts extracted with three multilingual
encoders, mCLIP, AraCLIP, and Jina V4, each evaluated separately for label
retrieval. A hybrid vocabulary is built from training captions and enriched
with about 21K general domain labels translated from the Visual Genome dataset,
covering objects, attributes, and scenes. The top-k retrieved labels are
transformed into fluent Arabic prompts and passed along with the original image
to vision-language models. In the second stage, we tested Qwen-VL and Gemini
Pro Vision for caption generation, resulting in six encoder-decoder
configurations. The results show that mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision achieved the
best BLEU-1 (5.34%) and cosine similarity (60.01%), while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL
obtained the highest LLM-judge score (36.33%). This interpretable pipeline
enables culturally coherent and contextually accurate Arabic captions.

### [5] [Convolutional Neural Nets vs Vision Transformers: A SpaceNet Case Study with Balanced vs Imbalanced Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03297)
*Akshar Gothi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 对比了EfficientNet-B0和ViT-Base在SpaceNet数据集上的性能，包括不平衡和平衡标签分布两种情况，发现CNN在效率上仍有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较卷积神经网络和视觉Transformer在遥感图像分类任务中的表现，特别是在不同标签分布情况下的差异。

Method: 在SpaceNet数据集上进行控制实验，使用不平衡五类分割和平衡重采样分割（每类700张图像），采用相同的预处理、轻量级数据增强和40轮训练预算。

Result: 在不平衡分割中，EfficientNet-B0达到93%测试准确率且延迟更低；ViT-Base也达到93%但参数更多、运行时间更长。在平衡分割中，两者表现都很强，EfficientNet-B0达到99%，ViT-Base保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 平衡标签分布缩小了架构差距，但CNN在效率方面仍保持优势。

Abstract: We present a controlled comparison of a convolutional neural network
(EfficientNet-B0) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) on SpaceNet under two
label-distribution regimes: a naturally imbalanced five-class split and a
balanced-resampled split with 700 images per class (70:20:10 train/val/test).
With matched preprocessing (224x224, ImageNet normalization), lightweight
augmentations, and a 40-epoch budget on a single NVIDIA P100, we report
accuracy, macro-F1, balanced accuracy, per-class recall, and deployment metrics
(model size and latency). On the imbalanced split, EfficientNet-B0 reaches 93%
test accuracy with strong macro-F1 and lower latency; ViT-Base is competitive
at 93% with a larger parameter count and runtime. On the balanced split, both
models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains
competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs
retain an efficiency edge. We release manifests, logs, and per-image
predictions to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, remains a critical global challenge, as conventional
infrastructure-based measures often prove inadequate in dynamic urban
environments. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in
visual perception and reasoning, open new opportunities for proactive and
context-aware VRU protection. However, existing surveys on AI applications for
VRUs predominantly focus on detection, offering limited coverage of other
vision-based tasks that are essential for comprehensive VRU understanding and
protection. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent progress in
camera-based AI sensing systems for VRU safety, with an emphasis on
developments from the past five years and emerging research trends. We
systematically examine four core tasks, namely detection and classification,
tracking and reidentification, trajectory prediction, and intent recognition
and prediction, which together form the backbone of AI-empowered proactive
solutions for VRU protection in intelligent transportation systems. To guide
future research, we highlight four major open challenges from the perspectives
of data, model, and deployment. By linking advances in visual AI with practical
considerations for real-world implementation, this survey aims to provide a
foundational reference for the development of next-generation sensing systems
to enhance VRU safety.

### [7] [The View From Space: Navigating Instrumentation Differences with EOFMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03316)
*Ryan P. Demilt,Nicholas LaHaye,Karis Tenneson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 地球观测基础模型（EOFMs）的表示空间对传感器架构高度敏感，理解这种差异对于改进模型设计和应用至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EOFMs大多在单一模态数据上训练，然后跨模态应用，但传感器架构对模型内部表示的影响尚不明确。

Method: 分析不同传感器架构对EOFMs表示空间的影响，揭示当前模型设计的局限性。

Result: EOFMs的表示空间对传感器架构高度敏感，这暴露了当前模型设计的缺陷。

Conclusion: 理解传感器架构对EOFMs表示的影响为模型开发者、用户和遥感科学界提供了重要指导，指明了改进方向。

Abstract: Earth Observation Foundation Models (EOFMs) have exploded in prevalence as
tools for processing the massive volumes of remotely sensed and other earth
observation data, and for delivering impact on the many essential earth
monitoring tasks. An emerging trend posits using the outputs of pre-trained
models as 'embeddings' which summarize high dimensional data to be used for
generic tasks such as similarity search and content-specific queries. However,
most EOFM models are trained only on single modalities of data and then applied
or benchmarked by matching bands across different modalities. It is not clear
from existing work what impact diverse sensor architectures have on the
internal representations of the present suite of EOFMs. We show in this work
that the representation space of EOFMs is highly sensitive to sensor
architecture and that understanding this difference gives a vital perspective
on the pitfalls of current EOFM design and signals for how to move forward as
model developers, users, and a community guided by robust remote-sensing
science.

### [8] [Photorealistic Inpainting for Perturbation-based Explanations in Ecological Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03317)
*Günel Aghakishiyeva,Jiayi Zhou,Saagar Arya,James David Poling,Holly R. Houliston,Jamie N. Womble,David W. Johnston,Brinnae Bent*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于修复引导的扰动解释技术，通过生成逼真的局部编辑来揭示视觉模型在生态监测中的预测依据，提高AI在生态学中的可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态监测中自动化视觉模型的不透明预测限制了信任和实际应用，需要可解释的方法来揭示模型决策依据。

Method: 使用修复引导的扰动解释技术，结合Segment-Anything-Model精炼的掩码，进行对象移除/替换和背景替换等干预，生成保持场景上下文的逼真编辑。

Result: 该方法能够定位诊断性结构，避免传统扰动的删除伪影，产生领域相关的见解，支持专家验证。

Conclusion: 该解释技术为生态学中AI的可信部署提供了有效支持，能够生成生态学上合理的解释，增强模型透明度。

Abstract: Ecological monitoring is increasingly automated by vision models, yet opaque
predictions limit trust and field adoption. We present an inpainting-guided,
perturbation-based explanation technique that produces photorealistic,
mask-localized edits that preserve scene context. Unlike masking or blurring,
these edits stay in-distribution and reveal which fine-grained morphological
cues drive predictions in tasks such as species recognition and trait
attribution. We demonstrate the approach on a YOLOv9 detector fine-tuned for
harbor seal detection in Glacier Bay drone imagery, using
Segment-Anything-Model-refined masks to support two interventions: (i) object
removal/replacement (e.g., replacing seals with plausible ice/water or boats)
and (ii) background replacement with original animals composited onto new
scenes. Explanations are assessed by re-scoring perturbed images (flip rate,
confidence drop) and by expert review for ecological plausibility and
interpretability. The resulting explanations localize diagnostic structures,
avoid deletion artifacts common to traditional perturbations, and yield
domain-relevant insights that support expert validation and more trustworthy
deployment of AI in ecology.

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) stands as a cornerstone in medical image
analysis, playing a pivotal role in precise diagnostics, treatment planning,
and monitoring of various medical conditions. This paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic survey of MIS methodologies, bridging the gap
between traditional image processing techniques and modern deep learning
approaches. The survey encompasses thresholding, edge detection, region-based
segmentation, clustering algorithms, and model-based techniques while also
delving into state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), and the widely
adopted U-Net and its variants. Moreover, integrating attention mechanisms,
semi-supervised learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and
Transformer-based models is thoroughly explored. In addition to covering
established methods, this survey highlights emerging trends, including hybrid
architectures, cross-modality learning, federated and distributed learning
frameworks, and active learning strategies, which aim to address challenges
such as limited labeled datasets, computational complexity, and model
generalizability across diverse imaging modalities. Furthermore, a specialized
case study on lumbar spine segmentation is presented, offering insights into
the challenges and advancements in this relatively underexplored anatomical
region. Despite significant progress in the field, critical challenges persist,
including dataset bias, domain adaptation, interpretability of deep learning
models, and integration into real-world clinical workflows.

### [10] [DECOR: Deep Embedding Clustering with Orientation Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03328)
*Fiona Victoria Stanley Jothiraj,Arunaggiri Pandian Karunanidhi,Seth A. Eichmeyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DECOR是一个具有方向鲁棒性的深度聚类框架，用于对晶圆缺陷模式进行聚类，无需手动调参即可在MixedWM38数据集上发现一致的缺陷簇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造中，晶圆缺陷的早期检测对产品良率优化至关重要。原始晶圆数据复杂、无标签、不平衡且可能包含多种缺陷，需要设计在非理想数据条件下仍可靠的聚类方法。

Method: DECOR框架通过深度聚类结合方向鲁棒性，明确考虑晶圆图中的方向变化，确保空间相似的缺陷无论旋转或对齐方式如何都能被一致聚类。

Result: 在MixedWM38数据集上的实验表明，DECOR优于现有的聚类基线方法，能够可靠地发现缺陷簇。

Conclusion: DECOR为自动化视觉检测系统提供了一个可靠且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, early detection of wafer defects is critical
for product yield optimization. However, raw wafer data from wafer quality
tests are often complex, unlabeled, imbalanced and can contain multiple defects
on a single wafer, making it crucial to design clustering methods that remain
reliable under such imperfect data conditions. We introduce DECOR, a deep
clustering with orientation robustness framework that groups complex defect
patterns from wafer maps into consistent clusters. We evaluate our method on
the open source MixedWM38 dataset, demonstrating its ability to discover
clusters without manual tuning. DECOR explicitly accounts for orientation
variations in wafer maps, ensuring that spatially similar defects are
consistently clustered regardless of its rotation or alignment. Experiments
indicate that our method outperforms existing clustering baseline methods, thus
providing a reliable and scalable solution in automated visual inspection
systems.

### [11] [Error correction in multiclass image classification of facial emotion on unbalanced samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03337)
*Andrey A. Lebedev,Victor B. Kazantsev,Sergey V. Stasenko*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LSTM和注意力机制的面部表情分类方法，专门针对类别不平衡问题，通过排除一个类别训练后纠正该类别错误，在稀有事件检测中表现出潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多类别面部表情分类中的类别不平衡问题，其中某些情绪类别显著多于其他类别，影响分类性能。

Method: 使用基于LSTM的神经网络模型，结合注意力机制聚焦于面部关键区域；在训练时排除一个类别，然后对该类别进行错误纠正。

Result: 所有类别都能进行纠正，但成功程度不同；在测试样本中，对小类别的关键质量指标有所提升。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效应用于面部表情分析系统，特别适用于类别分布偏斜情况下的稳定分类任务，如反欺诈系统中的稀有事件检测。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of error correction in multi-class
classification of face images on unbalanced samples. The study is based on the
analysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional
states of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem
of class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others.
To solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with
an attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative
for emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is
trained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with
subsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training
stage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although
the degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are
worse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an
increase in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates
the promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the
search for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed
method can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in
tasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution.

*Brian Chao,Hung-Yu Tseng,Lorenzo Porzi,Chen Gao,Tuotuo Li,Qinbo Li,Ayush Saraf,Jia-Bin Huang,Johannes Kopf,Gordon Wetzstein,Changil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)表达能力的方法，通过为每个高斯添加纹理映射来模拟空间变化的颜色和透明度，从而超越传统3DGS中每个高斯只能表示单一颜色和简单椭球体的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅技术中，被同一高斯覆盖的像素总是呈现相同颜色，且每个高斯只能表示简单的椭球体几何细节，这严重限制了高斯基元的表达能力。

Method: 受传统图形学中纹理和alpha映射的启发，为每个高斯添加alpha、RGB或RGBA纹理映射，使每个高斯能够表示更丰富的纹理模式和几何结构。

Result: 在多种标准基准数据集和自定义捕获数据上验证，相比现有方法使用相似或更少的高斯数量，实现了图像质量的提升。

Conclusion: 通过纹理映射增强高斯表达能力是有效的，特别是仅使用alpha纹理映射就能显著提升表达能力，而结合RGB纹理映射则能达到最高表达能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction and rendering technique due to its high-quality results and fast
training and rendering time. However, pixels covered by the same Gaussian are
always shaded in the same color up to a Gaussian falloff scaling factor.
Furthermore, the finest geometric detail any individual Gaussian can represent
is a simple ellipsoid. These properties of 3DGS greatly limit the expressivity
of individual Gaussian primitives. To address these issues, we draw inspiration
from texture and alpha mapping in traditional graphics and integrate it with
3DGS. Specifically, we propose a new generalized Gaussian appearance
representation that augments each Gaussian with alpha~(A), RGB, or RGBA texture
maps to model spatially varying color and opacity across the extent of each
Gaussian. As such, each Gaussian can represent a richer set of texture patterns
and geometric structures, instead of just a single color and ellipsoid as in
naive Gaussian Splatting. Surprisingly, we found that the expressivity of
Gaussians can be greatly improved by using alpha-only texture maps, and further
augmenting Gaussians with RGB texture maps achieves the highest expressivity.
We validate our method on a wide variety of standard benchmark datasets and our
own custom captures at both the object and scene levels. We demonstrate image
quality improvements over existing methods while using a similar or lower
number of Gaussians.

TL;DR: 提出了DCG-Bench基准，评估多模态大语言模型在动态图表生成任务中的能力，并开发了Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B模型，在三个任务上平均性能提升8.31%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在静态图表生成和理解方面取得进展，但在动态图表生成和理解方面的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建DCG-8K高质量数据集，采用两阶段训练方法，提出联合代码视觉奖励进行组相对策略优化。

Result: 模型在三个任务上平均性能提升8.31%，仅用3B参数就达到与专有模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的训练方法有效，填补了动态图表生成研究的空白，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Dynamic Chart Generation (DCG) involves producing code-rendered animated
visualizations as charts. While recent advances in multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their capability on static chart
generation and comprehension, MLLMs' potential for handling dynamic chart
generation and understanding remains underexplored. To bridge this research
gap, we introduce DCG-Bench (Dynamic Chart Generation Benchmark), the first
benchmark evaluating MLLM's capability on dynamic chart generation tasks from
three dimensions: Simple Text-to-Chart, Detailed Text-to-Chart, and
Video-to-Chart tasks. We construct DCG-8K, a high-quality DCG dataset with
annotations covering instruction-code-video triplets and QA pairs for both code
and video evaluation. Based on DCG-8K, we explored a two-stage training recipe,
proposing Joint-Code-Visual Reward for group relative policy optimization to
construct expert MLLM Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B for the DCG task. Our benchmarking
result reveals shortcomings of existing MLLMs in the visual-to-chart task, and
our model beats the best open-sourced MLLM with an average 8.31% performance
gain across three tasks, and shows on par performance against proprietary
models with only 3B parameters, proving the effectiveness of our training
recipe. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

Motivation: 传统单目视觉里程计方法依赖预训练的深度学习组件和优化模块，形成复杂流程，严重依赖相机标定和超参数调优，在未见过的真实场景中表现不佳。现有的大规模3D模型虽然提供了一定泛化能力，但在处理长视频和提供精确逐帧估计方面仍有局限。

Method: 提出VoT框架，通过提取特征并使用时序和空间注意力建模全局关系，直接预测相机运动而无需估计稠密几何。该框架模块化且灵活，可无缝集成各种预训练编码器作为特征提取器，仅使用相机位姿进行监督。

Result: 实验结果表明，VoT能有效扩展到更大数据集，从更强的预训练骨干网络中显著受益，在不同相机运动和标定设置下具有良好泛化能力，性能优于传统方法且运行速度快3倍以上。

Conclusion: 单目视觉里程计可以通过端到端方式有效解决，无需传统手工组件，VoT框架展示了在性能、速度和泛化能力方面的优势。

Abstract: Modern monocular visual odometry methods typically combine pre-trained deep
learning components with optimization modules, resulting in complex pipelines
that rely heavily on camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning, and often
struggle in unseen real-world scenarios. Recent large-scale 3D models trained
on massive amounts of multi-modal data have partially alleviated these
challenges, providing generalizable dense reconstruction and camera pose
estimation. Still, they remain limited in handling long videos and providing
accurate per-frame estimates, which are required for visual odometry. In this
work, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed
effectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for
handcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera
calibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual
odometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by
extracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and
spatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion
without estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for
supervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless
integration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental
results demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits
substantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse
camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods
while running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released.

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse
problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that
could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely
ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search
algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a
manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate
and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based
guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image
reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse
problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring
tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that
our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance
of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior
performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward
gradient-based guidance algorithms. The code is available at

Abstract: Sonar images are relevant for advancing underwater exploration, autonomous
navigation, and ecosystem monitoring. However, the progress depends on data
availability. The scarcity of publicly available, well-annotated sonar image
datasets creates a significant bottleneck for the development of robust machine
learning models. This paper presents a comprehensive and concise review of the
current landscape of sonar image datasets, seeking not only to catalog existing
resources but also to contextualize them, identify gaps, and provide a clear
roadmap, serving as a base guide for researchers of any kind who wish to start

publicly accessible datasets across various sonar modalities, including Side
Scan Sonar (SSS), Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS), Synthetic Aperture Sonar (SAS),
Multibeam Echo Sounder (MBES), and Dual-Frequency Identification Sonar
(DIDSON). An analysis was conducted on applications such as classification,
detection, segmentation, and 3D reconstruction. This work focuses on
state-of-the-art advancements, incorporating newly released datasets. The
findings are synthesized into a master table and a chronological timeline,
offering a clear and accessible comparison of characteristics, sizes, and

Conclusion: 溯源网络为现有可解释性技术提供了补充方法，解决了深度学习中的关键挑战，包括模型不透明性、幻觉和数据贡献者信用分配问题，提高了神经模型的透明度、鲁棒性和可信度。

Abstract: We introduce provenance networks, a novel class of neural models designed to
provide end-to-end, training-data-driven explainability. Unlike conventional
post-hoc methods, provenance networks learn to link each prediction directly to
its supporting training examples as part of the model's normal operation,
embedding interpretability into the architecture itself. Conceptually, the
model operates similarly to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by
concrete exemplars weighted by relevance in the feature space. This approach
facilitates systematic investigations of the trade-off between memorization and
generalization, enables verification of whether a given input was included in
the training set, aids in the detection of mislabeled or anomalous data points,
enhances resilience to input perturbations, and supports the identification of
similar inputs contributing to the generation of a new data point. By jointly
optimizing the primary task and the explainability objective, provenance
networks offer insights into model behavior that traditional deep networks
cannot provide. While the model introduces additional computational cost and
currently scales to moderately sized datasets, it provides a complementary
approach to existing explainability techniques. In particular, it addresses
critical challenges in modern deep learning, including model opaqueness,
hallucination, and the assignment of credit to data contributors, thereby
improving transparency, robustness, and trustworthiness in neural models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了统一成本过滤(UCF)框架，用于改进无监督异常检测方法，通过构建成本体积并应用可学习的过滤模块来减少匹配噪声，在单模态和多模态场景下均取得SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督异常检测方法存在匹配噪声问题，且单模态和多模态方法研究相对孤立，缺乏统一框架。本文旨在从匹配角度统一处理单模态和多模态异常检测。

Method: 提出统一成本过滤(UCF)框架，构建测试样本与正常样本的成本体积，使用带有多层注意力引导的可学习过滤模块来减少匹配噪声并突出细微异常。

Result: 在22个不同基准测试上的综合实验表明，UCF能有效增强多种UAD方法，在单模态(RGB)和多模态(RGB-3D、RGB-Text)场景下均实现新的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: UCF是一个通用的后处理细化框架，能够显著提升各种无监督异常检测方法的性能，为单模态和多模态异常检测提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to identify image- and pixel-level
anomalies using only normal training data, with wide applications such as
industrial inspection and medical analysis, where anomalies are scarce due to
privacy concerns and cold-start constraints. Existing methods, whether
reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based
(pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level
matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely
overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal
RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D
and RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models.
Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a
comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate
unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching
perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a
generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any
UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against
normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable
filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample,
mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in
enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art
results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) UAD
scenarios. Code and models will be released at
https://github.com/ZHE-SAPI/CostFilter-AD.

Motivation: 工业图纸数字化过程中缺乏自动评估对象检测结果质量的方法

Method: 利用视觉语言模型的多模态能力识别缺失或不一致的检测结果

Result: 实现了自动质量评估并提高了复杂工业图纸上的整体检测性能

Conclusion: 该框架填补了工业图纸数字化中对象检测质量评估的空白

Abstract: Industrial diagrams such as piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are
essential for the design, operation, and maintenance of industrial plants.
Converting these diagrams into digital form is an important step toward
building digital twins and enabling intelligent industrial automation. A
central challenge in this digitalization process is accurate object detection.
Although recent advances have significantly improved object detection
algorithms, there remains a lack of methods to automatically evaluate the
quality of their outputs. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a
framework that employs Visual Language Models (VLMs) to assess object detection
results and guide their refinement. The approach exploits the multimodal
capabilities of VLMs to identify missing or inconsistent detections, thereby
enabling automated quality assessment and improving overall detection
performance on complex industrial diagrams.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal reasoning but still
face challenges in spatial reasoning for 3D scenes and complex object
configurations. To address this, we introduce SpatialViLT, an enhanced VLM that
integrates spatial features like depth maps, 3D coordinates, and edge maps
through a multi-task learning framework. This approach enriches multimodal
embeddings with spatial understanding. We propose two variants: SpatialViLT and
MaskedSpatialViLT, focusing on full and masked object regions, respectively.
Additionally, SpatialEnsemble combines both approaches, achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our models excel in spatial reasoning categories
such as directional, topological, and proximity relations, as demonstrated on
the challenging Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset. This work represents a
significant step in enhancing the spatial intelligence of AI systems, crucial
for advanced multimodal understanding and real-world applications.

Motivation: 两相光学切片结构照明显微镜中，减少采集时间会引入传统去噪方法难以抑制的残留伪影，而监督训练又缺乏干净的基准数据

Method: 使用合成训练对（将真实伪影场应用于合成图像），训练非对称去噪自编码器和U-Net网络，然后在真实OS-SI图像上进行评估

Result: 两种网络都提高了图像清晰度，各自在不同类型的伪影抑制方面表现优异

Conclusion: 合成训练能够实现OS-SI图像的监督去噪，编码器-解码器网络有潜力简化重建工作流程

Abstract: Structured illumination (SI) enhances image resolution and contrast by
projecting patterned light onto a sample. In two-phase optical-sectioning SI
(OS-SI), reduced acquisition time introduces residual artifacts that
conventional denoising struggles to suppress. Deep learning offers an
alternative to traditional methods; however, supervised training is limited by
the lack of clean, optically sectioned ground-truth data. We investigate
encoder-decoder networks for artifact reduction in two-phase OS-SI, using
synthetic training pairs formed by applying real artifact fields to synthetic
images. An asymmetrical denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a U-Net are trained on
the synthetic data, then evaluated on real OS-SI images. Both networks improve
image clarity, with each excelling against different artifact types. These
results demonstrate that synthetic training enables supervised denoising of
OS-SI images and highlight the potential of encoder-decoder networks to
streamline reconstruction workflows.

Abstract: Automated tennis stroke analysis has advanced significantly with the
integration of biomechanical motion cues alongside deep learning techniques,
enhancing stroke classification accuracy and player performance evaluation.
Despite these advancements, existing systems often fail to connect
biomechanical insights with actionable language feedback that is both
accessible and meaningful to players and coaches. This research project
addresses this gap by developing a novel framework that extracts key
biomechanical features (such as joint angles, limb velocities, and kinetic
chain patterns) from motion data using Convolutional Neural Network Long
Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)-based models. These features are analyzed for
relationships influencing stroke effectiveness and injury risk, forming the
basis for feedback generation using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging
the THETIS dataset and feature extraction techniques, our approach aims to
produce feedback that is technically accurate, biomechanically grounded, and
actionable for end-users. The experimental setup evaluates this framework on
classification performance and interpretability, bridging the gap between
explainable AI and sports biomechanics.

Abstract: Integrating histopathology with spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides a
powerful opportunity to link tissue morphology with molecular function. Yet
most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable
genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological
programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced
Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents
transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By
encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning
them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces
dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal
correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node),
PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both
gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4
percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These
results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways
produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models,
advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.

Abstract: Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research
communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often
requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10
minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves
distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal
information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple
aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To
address these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101
research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and
speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta
Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos
convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we
propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation
video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout
refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,
subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing
slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate
that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and
informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward
automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and

Abstract: The automatic generation of diverse and human-like facial reactions in dyadic
dialogue remains a critical challenge for human-computer interaction systems.
Existing methods fail to model the stochasticity and dynamics inherent in real
human reactions. To address this, we propose ReactDiff, a novel temporal
diffusion framework for generating diverse facial reactions that are
appropriate for responding to any given dialogue context. Our key insight is
that plausible human reactions demonstrate smoothness, and coherence over time,
and conform to constraints imposed by human facial anatomy. To achieve this,
ReactDiff incorporates two vital priors (spatio-temporal facial kinematics)
into the diffusion process: i) temporal facial behavioral kinematics and ii)
facial action unit dependencies. These two constraints guide the model toward
realistic human reaction manifolds, avoiding visually unrealistic jitters,
unstable transitions, unnatural expressions, and other artifacts. Extensive
experiments on the REACT2024 dataset demonstrate that our approach not only
achieves state-of-the-art reaction quality but also excels in diversity and
reaction appropriateness.

Abstract: Deep learning for medical imaging is hampered by task-specific models that
lack generalizability and prognostic capabilities, while existing 'universal'
approaches suffer from simplistic conditioning and poor medical semantic
understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce DuPLUS, a deep
learning framework for efficient multi-modal medical image analysis. DuPLUS
introduces a novel vision-language framework that leverages hierarchical
semantic prompts for fine-grained control over the analysis task, a capability
absent in prior universal models. To enable extensibility to other medical
tasks, it includes a hierarchical, text-controlled architecture driven by a
unique dual-prompt mechanism. For segmentation, DuPLUS is able to generalize
across three imaging modalities, ten different anatomically various medical
datasets, encompassing more than 30 organs and tumor types. It outperforms the
state-of-the-art task specific and universal models on 8 out of 10 datasets. We
demonstrate extensibility of its text-controlled architecture by seamless
integration of electronic health record (EHR) data for prognosis prediction,
and on a head and neck cancer dataset, DuPLUS achieved a Concordance Index (CI)
of 0.69. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks
and modalities from varying centers, establishing DuPLUS as a versatile and
clinically relevant solution for medical image analysis. The code for this work

Abstract: Real-time animal detection and segmentation in natural environments are vital
for wildlife conservation, enabling non-invasive monitoring through remote
camera streams. However, these tasks remain challenging due to limited
computational resources and the cryptic appearance of many species. We propose
a mobile-optimized two-stage deep learning framework that integrates a
Threading Detection Model (TDM) to parallelize YOLOv10-based detection and
MobileSAM-based segmentation. Unlike prior YOLO+SAM pipelines, our approach
improves real-time performance by reducing latency through threading. YOLOv10
handles detection while MobileSAM performs lightweight segmentation, both
executed concurrently for efficient resource use. On the cryptic Houbara
Bustard, a conservation-priority species, our model achieves mAP50 of 0.9627,
mAP75 of 0.7731, mAP95 of 0.7178, and a MobileSAM mIoU of 0.7421. YOLOv10
operates at 43.7 ms per frame, confirming real-time readiness. We introduce a
curated Houbara dataset of 40,000 annotated images to support model training
and evaluation across diverse conditions. The code and dataset used in this
study are publicly available on GitHub at

### [29] [Platonic Transformers: A Solid Choice For Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03511)
*Mohammad Mohaiminul Islam,Rishabh Anand,David R. Wessels,Friso de Kruiff,Thijs P. Kuipers,Rex Ying,Clara I. Sánchez,Sharvaree Vadgama,Georg Bökman,Erik J. Bekkers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Platonic Transformer是一种新型Transformer架构，通过引入柏拉图立体对称群的参考框架来实现几何等变性，在保持标准Transformer架构和计算成本的同时，实现了对连续平移和柏拉图对称性的等变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer缺乏对科学和计算机视觉中常见几何对称性的归纳偏置，而现有的等变方法往往通过复杂计算设计牺牲了Transformer的效率和灵活性。

Method: 通过定义相对于柏拉图立体对称群参考框架的注意力机制，引入原则性的权重共享方案，该方法在形式上等价于动态群卷积，可以学习自适应几何滤波器。

Result: 在计算机视觉（CIFAR-10）、3D点云（ScanObjectNN）和分子属性预测（QM9、OMol25）等多个基准测试中，Platonic Transformer通过利用几何约束实现了有竞争力的性能，且无需额外成本。

Conclusion: Platonic Transformer成功解决了Transformer在几何等变性与效率之间的权衡问题，为几何感知的深度学习提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: While widespread, Transformers lack inductive biases for geometric symmetries
common in science and computer vision. Existing equivariant methods often
sacrifice the efficiency and flexibility that make Transformers so effective
through complex, computationally intensive designs. We introduce the Platonic
Transformer to resolve this trade-off. By defining attention relative to
reference frames from the Platonic solid symmetry groups, our method induces a
principled weight-sharing scheme. This enables combined equivariance to
continuous translations and Platonic symmetries, while preserving the exact
architecture and computational cost of a standard Transformer. Furthermore, we
show that this attention is formally equivalent to a dynamic group convolution,
which reveals that the model learns adaptive geometric filters and enables a
highly scalable, linear-time convolutional variant. Across diverse benchmarks
in computer vision (CIFAR-10), 3D point clouds (ScanObjectNN), and molecular
property prediction (QM9, OMol25), the Platonic Transformer achieves
competitive performance by leveraging these geometric constraints at no
additional cost.

TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于领域泛化语义分割的综述，重点讨论了深度神经网络在未知领域泛化的挑战，以及基础模型在该领域带来的范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在未知领域的泛化能力仍然是一个重大挑战，领域泛化方法旨在不接触目标域的情况下实现跨多个不同未见目标域的泛化，这在语义分割任务中尤为重要。

Method: 作者对现有方法进行了聚类和回顾，识别了向基础模型驱动的领域泛化的范式转变，并进行了广泛的性能比较分析。

Result: 性能比较突显了基础模型对领域泛化的显著影响，基础模型方法在该领域表现出色。

Conclusion: 本综述旨在推动领域泛化研究，并激励科学家探索新的研究方向，特别是基于基础模型的方法。

Abstract: The generalization of deep neural networks to unknown domains is a major
challenge despite their tremendous progress in recent years. For this reason,
the dynamic area of domain generalization (DG) has emerged. In contrast to
unsupervised domain adaptation, there is no access to or knowledge about the
target domains, and DG methods aim to generalize across multiple different
unseen target domains. Domain generalization is particularly relevant for the
task semantic segmentation which is used in several areas such as biomedicine
or automated driving. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
rapidly evolving topic of domain generalized semantic segmentation. We cluster
and review existing approaches and identify the paradigm shift towards
foundation-model-based domain generalization. Finally, we provide an extensive
performance comparison of all approaches, which highlights the significant
influence of foundation models on domain generalization. This survey seeks to
advance domain generalization research and inspire scientists to explore new
research directions.

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的自动内窥镜报告生成模型，通过两阶段训练减少胃肠科医生文档负担


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜检查的文档记录给胃肠科医生带来沉重负担，导致临床工作流程效率低下和医生倦怠

Method: 使用基于Transformer的视觉编码器和文本解码器，采用两阶段训练：先在图像/文本对上进行预训练，然后在图像/报告对上进行微调

Result: 模型能够生成具有临床意义的检查发现，简化文档流程

Conclusion: 该方法有望减轻医生工作负担并改善患者护理

Abstract: Endoscopic procedures such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and
colonoscopy play a critical role in diagnosing and managing gastrointestinal
(GI) disorders. However, the documentation burden associated with these
procedures place significant strain on gastroenterologists, contributing to
inefficiencies in clinical workflows and physician burnout. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel automated report generation model that leverages
a transformer-based vision encoder and text decoder within a two-stage training
framework. In the first stage, both components are pre-trained on image/text
caption pairs to capture generalized vision-language features, followed by
fine-tuning on images/report pairs to generate clinically meaningful findings.
Our approach not only streamlines the documentation process but also holds
promise for reducing physician workload and improving patient care.

*Sixten Norelius,Aaron O. Feldman,Mac Schwager*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SketchPlan是一个基于扩散模型的无人机路径规划系统，通过手绘草图在深度图像上生成3D飞行路径，实现零样本从仿真到现实的迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机导航中如何将人类手绘草图意图准确转换为安全可行的3D飞行路径的问题，特别是在未见过的真实环境中。

Method: 包含SketchAdapter（将手绘草图映射到2D路径）和DiffPath（从2D投影和深度图像推断3D轨迹）两个组件，使用混合标注数据和模块化设计。

Result: 在真实世界无人机测试中，低/中等障碍物环境中成功率100%，高障碍物环境中成功率40%，比关键消融实验高出20-60%。

Conclusion: 通过混合人工标注和自动标注数据训练，结合模块化设计，SketchPlan能有效解释人类意图并推断3D路径，实现零样本仿真到现实的迁移。

Abstract: We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D
hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone
navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to
map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model
that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth
image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate
and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train
the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set
of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data
by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and
use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D
sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label
872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the
SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate
SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and
show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled
data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to
correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests,
SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen
high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task
completion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对AI视频会议系统中身份劫持攻击的防御方法，通过从姿态-表情潜在空间中提取生物特征信息来检测非法身份交换，无需查看重建的RGB视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI视频会议系统通过传输紧凑的姿态-表情潜在空间来重建RGB视频，但这种潜在空间可能被恶意操控，导致攻击者能够实时劫持受害者的形象。由于每帧都是合成的，现有的深度伪造和合成视频检测器无法有效工作。

Method: 利用姿态-表情潜在空间包含驱动身份生物特征信息的关键观察，提出了一个姿态条件化、大间隔对比编码器，该编码器能够分离出传输潜在空间中的持久身份线索，同时消除瞬态姿态和表情信息。

Result: 在多个说话头生成模型上的实验表明，该方法始终优于现有的傀儡攻击防御方法，能够实时运行，并在分布外场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过从姿态-表情潜在空间中提取和验证生物特征信息，可以有效防御AI视频会议系统中的身份劫持攻击，提供了一种无需查看合成视频的实时安全解决方案。

Abstract: AI-based talking-head videoconferencing systems reduce bandwidth by sending a
compact pose-expression latent and re-synthesizing RGB at the receiver, but
this latent can be puppeteered, letting an attacker hijack a victim's likeness
in real time. Because every frame is synthetic, deepfake and synthetic video
detectors fail outright. To address this security problem, we exploit a key
observation: the pose-expression latent inherently contains biometric
information of the driving identity. Therefore, we introduce the first
biometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video:
a pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent
identity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and
expression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit
identity swaps as the video is rendered. Our experiments on multiple
talking-head generation models show that our method consistently outperforms
existing puppeteering defenses, operates in real-time, and shows strong
generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REVEL提出了一种新的流式拖拽视频编辑任务，DragStream方法通过自适应分布自校正和空间频率选择性优化机制，解决了潜在空间漂移和上下文干扰问题，实现了对自回归视频扩散模型的细粒度交互控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自回归视频扩散模型难以实现流式、细粒度的输出控制，难以确保结果始终符合用户预期。需要一种能够随时对生成视频进行任意内容细粒度交互拖拽编辑的方法。

Method: 提出训练无关的DragStream方法，包含：1）自适应分布自校正策略，利用相邻帧统计信息约束潜在嵌入漂移；2）空间频率选择性优化机制，在充分利用上下文信息的同时通过选择性传播视觉线索来减轻干扰。

Result: 该方法可无缝集成到现有自回归视频扩散模型中，大量实验充分证明了DragStream的有效性。

Conclusion: REVEL任务和DragStream方法成功解决了流式拖拽视频编辑中的关键挑战，实现了对视频扩散模型的细粒度交互控制，提升了编辑效果的自然度和一致性。

Abstract: Achieving streaming, fine-grained control over the outputs of autoregressive
video diffusion models remains challenging, making it difficult to ensure that
they consistently align with user expectations. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new
task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on
\emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and
SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating
video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and
rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we
observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space,
causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process;
\emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby
yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach,
\textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution
self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to
effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a
spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully
exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via
selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be
seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and
extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.

TL;DR: 提出GAS-MIL框架，通过集成多个基础模型特征来提升计算病理学诊断性能，无需手动特征选择或大量微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在计算病理学中作为通用特征提取器很强大，但针对特定诊断任务进行适配和基准测试耗时耗资源，特别是考虑到模型的规模和多样性。

Method: GAS-MIL（组聚合选择多实例学习）是一个灵活的集成框架，无缝整合多个基础模型的特征，保留它们的互补优势。

Result: 在前列腺癌（PANDA）、卵巢癌（UBC-OCEAN）和乳腺癌（TCGA-BrCa）三个癌症数据集的分类任务中，GAS-MIL始终优于或与单个基础模型和现有MIL方法表现相当。

Conclusion: GAS-MIL通过高效整合异构基础模型，简化了病理学模型部署，为未来多模态和精准肿瘤学应用提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed computational pathology by providing
powerful, general-purpose feature extractors. However, adapting and
benchmarking individual FMs for specific diagnostic tasks is often
time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially given their scale and
diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce Group-Aggregative Selection
Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL), a flexible ensemble framework that
seamlessly integrates features from multiple FMs, preserving their
complementary strengths without requiring manual feature selection or extensive
task-specific fine-tuning. Across classification tasks in three cancer
datasets-prostate (PANDA), ovarian (UBC-OCEAN), and breast (TCGA-BrCa)-GAS-MIL
consistently achieves superior or on-par performance relative to individual FMs
and established MIL methods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
By enabling efficient integration of heterogeneous FMs, GAS-MIL streamlines
model deployment for pathology and provides a scalable foundation for future
multimodal and precision oncology applications.

Motivation: 解决无人机递送纳洛酮系统中旁观者情境意识实时评估的研究空白，提高非专业人员在阿片类药物过量紧急情况下的应急响应能力。

Method: 创建了无人机辅助纳洛酮递送模拟数据集，提出基于图嵌入和Transformer模型的视频实时情境意识评估框架，整合几何、运动学和交互图特征。

Result: 实现了高性能的情境意识预测，在时间分割准确率上比FINCH基线方法提高了9%的帧平均准确率和5%的交并比。

Conclusion: 该研究支持开发能够有效指导旁观者的自适应无人机系统，改善紧急响应结果并挽救生命。

Abstract: Rapid naloxone delivery via drones offers a promising solution for responding
to opioid overdose emergencies (OOEs), by extending lifesaving interventions to
medically untrained bystanders before emergency medical services (EMS) arrive.
Recognizing the critical role of bystander situational awareness (SA) in
human-autonomy teaming (HAT), we address a key research gap in real-time SA
assessment by introducing the Drone-Assisted Naloxone Delivery Simulation
Dataset (DANDSD). This pioneering dataset captures HAT during simulated OOEs,
where college students without medical training act as bystanders tasked with
administering intranasal naloxone to a mock overdose victim. Leveraging this
dataset, we propose a video-based real-time SA assessment framework that
utilizes graph embeddings and transformer models to assess bystander SA in real
time. Our approach integrates visual perception and comprehension cues--such as
geometric, kinematic, and interaction graph features--and achieves
high-performance SA prediction. It also demonstrates strong temporal
segmentation accuracy, outperforming the FINCH baseline by 9% in Mean over
Frames (MoF) and 5% in Intersection over Union (IoU). This work supports the
development of adaptive drone systems capable of guiding bystanders
effectively, ultimately improving emergency response outcomes and saving lives.

Motivation: 食品包装上的OCR对于合规性和营养监测很重要，但由于多语言文本、密集布局、字体变化、反光和曲面等因素而具有挑战性。

Method: 使用包含231个产品（1,628张图像）的数据集，评估四种模型的覆盖率和速度，并创建包含113张图像（60个产品）的真值子集进行准确性评估。

Result: Tesseract在真值子集上实现了最低的字符错误率（0.912）和最高的BLEU分数（0.245）。EasyOCR在准确性和多语言支持之间取得了良好平衡。PaddleOCR实现了近乎完整的覆盖率但速度较慢，TrOCR表现最差。

Conclusion: 研究提供了包装特定的基准，建立了基线，并指出了布局感知方法和文本定位的发展方向。

Abstract: This study evaluates four open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
systems which are Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and TrOCR on real world food
packaging images. The aim is to assess their ability to extract ingredient
lists and nutrition facts panels. Accurate OCR for packaging is important for
compliance and nutrition monitoring but is challenging due to multilingual
text, dense layouts, varied fonts, glare, and curved surfaces. A dataset of 231
products (1,628 images) was processed by all four models to assess speed and
coverage, and a ground truth subset of 113 images (60 products) was created for
accuracy evaluation. Metrics include Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error
Rate (WER), BLEU, ROUGE-L, F1, coverage, and execution time. On the ground
truth subset, Tesseract achieved the lowest CER (0.912) and the highest BLEU
(0.245). EasyOCR provided a good balance between accuracy and multilingual
support. PaddleOCR achieved near complete coverage but was slower because it
ran on CPU only due to GPU incompatibility, and TrOCR produced the weakest
results despite GPU acceleration. These results provide a packaging-specific
benchmark, establish a baseline, and highlight directions for layout-aware
methods and text localization.

TL;DR: FrameOracle是一个轻量级即插即用模块，通过预测最相关帧和所需帧数来优化视频理解，在保持准确性的同时显著减少输入帧数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有帧采样策略无法适应信息密度和任务复杂度的变化，导致效率低下和信息损失，需要更智能的帧选择方法。

Method: 采用四阶段课程学习训练，前三个阶段使用跨模态相似度等弱代理信号，最后阶段利用新构建的FrameOracle-41K数据集提供的强监督关键帧标注。

Result: 在5个VLMs和6个基准测试中，FrameOracle将16帧输入平均减少到10.4帧而不损失准确性；从64帧候选帧中平均减少到13.9帧，同时准确率提升1.4%。

Conclusion: FrameOracle实现了可扩展视频理解的最优效率-准确性权衡，为视频语言模型提供了高效的帧选择解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced video understanding, but their
performance is limited by the number of input frames they can process. Existing
frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, often
fail to adapt to variations in information density or task complexity,
resulting in inefficiency and information loss. To address this, we present
FrameOracle, a lightweight and plug-and-play module that predicts both (1)
which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are
needed. FrameOracle is trained using a four-stage curriculum, with the first
three stages relying on weak proxy signals such as cross-modal similarity. In
the final stage, it leverages stronger supervision from a new dataset we
introduce, FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA collection to provide
keyframe annotations specifying the minimal set of frames required to answer
each question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks
demonstrate that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4
frames without any loss in accuracy. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it
reduces the input to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by
1.4%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable
video understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合协同微调(CFT)方法，通过整合标记和未标记数据来解决游戏视觉bug检测中标记数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏视觉bug的手动识别成本高且需要专业知识，而监督学习模型依赖大量标记数据，但这类bug出现频率低导致数据稀缺。

Method: 采用混合协同微调方法，利用目标游戏和同领域游戏的标记样本，同时结合未标记数据来增强特征表示学习。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在多个游戏环境中优于传统基线方法，即使在仅使用50%目标游戏标记数据时仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: CFT方法有效降低了特定目标游戏对标记数据的依赖，提高了游戏视觉bug检测的可扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: Manual identification of visual bugs in video games is a resource-intensive
and costly process, often demanding specialized domain knowledge. While
supervised visual bug detection models offer a promising solution, their
reliance on extensive labeled datasets presents a significant challenge due to
the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. To overcome this limitation, we propose
a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method that effectively integrates both labeled
and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled samples from the target game
and diverse co-domain games, additionally incorporating unlabeled data to
enhance feature representation learning. This strategy maximizes the utility of
all available data, substantially reducing the dependency on labeled examples
from the specific target game. The developed framework demonstrates enhanced
scalability and adaptability, facilitating efficient visual bug detection
across various game titles. Our experimental results show the robustness of the
proposed method for game visual bug detection, exhibiting superior performance
compared to conventional baselines across multiple gaming environments.
Furthermore, CFT maintains competitive performance even when trained with only
50% of the labeled data from the target game.

*Alexander V. Mantzaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRM模型在MNIST上表现良好（≈98%测试准确率），但在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100等小尺寸自然图像上过拟合严重，性能不如简单的CNN基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究HRM模型在原始训练条件下（无数据增强、相同优化器设置）作为实用图像分类器的可行性。

Method: 使用HRM模型（包含两个Transformer模块、DEQ风格单步训练、深度监督、RoPE位置编码和RMSNorm），在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上进行评估，采用无数据增强的原始训练策略。

Result: HRM在MNIST上达到约98%测试准确率，但在CIFAR-10上仅65.0%（CNN基准77.2%），CIFAR-100上仅29.7%（CNN基准45.3%），且训练速度慢约30倍。

Conclusion: 在无数据增强的小分辨率图像分类任务中，当前HRM模型不如简单的卷积架构，但通过模型改进可能获得显著提升。

Abstract: This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two
Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep
supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical
image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a
deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with
one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes
stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small
natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches
65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains
77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM
achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the
same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error
analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific
inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for
small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not
competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently
exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model
may allow it to improve greatly.

Motivation: 自监督学习（SSL）的最新进展使得学习通用视觉特征成为可能，DINOv2在大多数基准测试中超越了弱监督方法（WSL），需要系统分析其方法和性能。

Method: 采用多裁剪视图增强和均值教师自蒸馏方法，基于transformer骨干网络学习视觉特征，并与之前的SSL和WSL方法进行对比分析。

Result: DINOv2在大多数下游任务中超越了弱监督方法OpenCLIP等，其学习的特征展现出显著的涌现特性。

Conclusion: DINOv2虽然取得了显著进展，但仍存在局限性，需要进一步研究发展方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have made it possible to
learn general-purpose visual features that capture both the high-level
semantics and the fine-grained spatial structure of images. Most notably, the
recent DINOv2 has established a new state of the art by surpassing weakly
supervised methods (WSL) like OpenCLIP on most benchmarks. In this survey, we
examine the core ideas behind its approach, multi-crop view augmentation and
self-distillation with a mean teacher, and trace their development in previous
work. We then compare the performance of DINO and DINOv2 with other SSL and WSL
methods across various downstream tasks, and highlight some remarkable emergent
properties of their learned features with transformer backbones. We conclude by
briefly discussing DINOv2's limitations, its impact, and future research
directions.

Conclusion: DCS框架通过扩散模型和分类器的相互促进循环，有效解决了FSCIL中的数据稀缺和泛化挑战。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially
learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a
task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current
FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on
limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation,
their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective
guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel
framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and
FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a
dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state
directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the
feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored
maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits
level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class
discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session
confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated
images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better
reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL
benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class
learning.

Abstract: Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and
underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors.
Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and
insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent
need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present
MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety
violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces
three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000
vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining
regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a
clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant
clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and
(3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve
fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in
precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM
significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving
improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score
over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further
integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation
reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of
multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and
beyond.

Abstract: The integration of Diffusion Models into Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) is a substantial improvement in the detection of accidents. We present a
novel hybrid model integrating guidance classification with diffusion
techniques. By leveraging fine-tuned ExceptionNet architecture outputs as input
for our proposed diffusion model and processing image tensors as our
conditioning, our approach creates a robust classification framework. Our model
consists of multiple conditional modules, which aim to modulate the linear
projection of inputs using time embeddings and image covariate embeddings,
allowing the network to adapt its behavior dynamically throughout the diffusion
process. To address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models,
our implementation is cloud-based, enabling scalable and efficient processing.
Our strategy overcomes the shortcomings of conventional classification
approaches by leveraging diffusion models inherent capacity to effectively
understand complicated data distributions. We investigate important diffusion
characteristics, such as timestep schedulers, timestep encoding techniques,
timestep count, and architectural design changes, using a thorough ablation
study, and have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model
against the baseline models on a publicly available dataset. The proposed
diffusion model performs best in image-based accident detection with an
accuracy of 97.32%.

Conclusion: SAMSOD模型通过解决模态不平衡和梯度冲突问题，在多个RGB-T和RGB-D任务上实现了性能提升，展示了其有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment attractive objects by
combining RGB and thermal infrared images. To enhance performance, the Segment
Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance
convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high-
and low- activations are ignored, thereby leaving room for further performance
enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which
utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality
and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting
gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled
adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing
foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Fundamental experiments on
RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on scribble
supervised RGB-T SOD, fully supervised RGB-D SOD datasets and full-supervised
RGB-D rail surface defect detection all demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

Abstract: Referring expression comprehension (REC) aims to localize the target object
described by a natural language expression. Recent advances in vision-language
learning have led to significant performance improvements in REC tasks.
However, localizing extremely small objects remains a considerable challenge
despite its importance in real-world applications such as autonomous driving.
To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset and method for REC
targeting small objects. First, we present the small object REC (SOREC)
dataset, which consists of 100,000 pairs of referring expressions and
corresponding bounding boxes for small objects in driving scenarios. Second, we
propose the progressive-iterative zooming adapter (PIZA), an adapter module for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in
and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to
GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the
SOREC dataset. Our dataset, codes and pre-trained models are publicly available
on the project page.

Abstract: Segmenting of clinically important retinal blood vessels into arteries and
veins is a prerequisite for retinal vessel analysis. Such analysis can provide
potential insights and bio-markers for identifying and diagnosing various
retinal eye diseases. Alteration in the regularity and width of the retinal
blood vessels can act as an indicator of the health of the vasculature system
all over the body. It can help identify patients at high risk of developing
vasculature diseases like stroke and myocardial infarction. Over the years,
various Deep Learning architectures have been proposed to perform retinal
vessel segmentation. Recently, attention mechanisms have been increasingly used
in image segmentation tasks. The work proposes a new Deep Learning approach for
artery-vein segmentation. The new approach is based on the Attention mechanism
that is incorporated into the WNet Deep Learning model, and we call the model
as Attention-WNet. The proposed approach has been tested on publicly available
datasets such as HRF and DRIVE datasets. The proposed approach has outperformed
other state-of-art models available in the literature.

Motivation: 解决大规模多模态数据集中缺乏人口统计注释的问题，以理解训练数据在产生模型偏见中的作用。

Method: 使用经过验证的自动标注流程，结合目标检测、多模态字幕生成和微调分类器，为LAION-400M数据集创建人物中心注释，包括边界框、感知性别和种族/民族标签。

Result: 揭示了数据集中的人口统计不平衡和有害关联，如男性以及被感知为黑人或中东裔的个体与犯罪相关和负面内容的不成比例关联，并发现CLIP和Stable Diffusion中60-70%的性别偏见可由数据中的直接共现线性解释。

Conclusion: 该资源首次建立了数据集组成与下游模型偏见之间的大规模实证联系。

Abstract: Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong
demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases
remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations
in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating
person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million
bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically
generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic
labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and
finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and
harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and
individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and
negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable
Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our
resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset
composition and downstream model bias.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习检测非正规住区方法尚未充分利用预训练神经网络的潜力，需要比较任务特异性与数据量对检测性能的影响。

Method: 使用两种预训练神经网络：1）在大型多样化通用图像数据集上预训练的通用网络；2）在卫星图像上预训练的专业网络。

Result: 研究比较了两种网络在检测里约热内卢贫民窟任务上的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过对比实验，探究任务特异性与预训练数据量在非正规住区检测中的相对重要性。

Abstract: While deep learning methods for detecting informal settlements have already
been developed, they have not yet fully utilized the potential offered by
recent pretrained neural networks. We compare two types of pretrained neural
networks for detecting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: 1. Generic networks
pretrained on large diverse datasets of unspecific images, 2. A specialized
network pretrained on satellite imagery. While the latter is more specific to
the target task, the former has been pretrained on significantly more images.
Hence, this research investigates whether task specificity or data volume
yields superior performance in urban informal settlement detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的主动防御方法在Deepfake防护方面存在鲁棒性和可靠性不足的问题，需要开发更有效的对抗技术来揭示这些防御的脆弱性。

Method: 采用低秩适应(LoRA)修补技术，结合可学习的门控机制防止梯度爆炸，并引入多模态特征对齐(MMFA)损失函数实现语义层面的特征对齐。

Result: 仅使用1000个面部样本和单个训练周期，LoRA修补成功击败了多种主动防御方法，揭示了当前防御范式的关键弱点。

Conclusion: 当前Deepfake防御策略存在严重漏洞，需要开发更鲁棒的防御方法，同时提出的防御性LoRA修补可作为缓解新发现安全漏洞的补充方案。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant societal risks, motivating the development of
proactive defenses that embed adversarial perturbations in facial images to
prevent manipulation. However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive
defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach,
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug-and-play LoRA patch
into Deepfake generators to bypass state-of-the-art defenses. A learnable
gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents
gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature
Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align
with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we
present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a
complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security
vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of
fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses.
These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore
the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 参考集微调是一种有效的方法，能够利用测试时可用信息显著提升VPR模型在域差异较大场景下的性能。

Abstract: Given a query image, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is the task of retrieving
an image of the same place from a reference database with robustness to
viewpoint and appearance changes. Recent works show that some VPR benchmarks
are solved by methods using Vision-Foundation-Model backbones and trained on
large-scale and diverse VPR-specific datasets. Several benchmarks remain
challenging, particularly when the test environments differ significantly from
the usual VPR training datasets. We propose a complementary, unexplored source
of information to bridge the train-test domain gap, which can further improve
the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) VPR methods on such challenging
benchmarks. Concretely, we identify that the test-time reference set, the
"map", contains images and poses of the target domain, and must be available
before the test-time query is received in several VPR applications. Therefore,
we propose to perform simple Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF) of VPR models on
the map, boosting the SOTA (~2.3% increase on average for Recall@1) on these
challenging datasets. Finetuned models retain generalization, and RSF works
across diverse test datasets.

TL;DR: ARSAM通过自适应采样-重用-混合分解梯度的方法，在保持SAM泛化能力的同时显著加速训练，速度提升约40%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM虽然能提高模型泛化能力，但计算成本是SGD的两倍，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 将SAM梯度分解为SGD梯度和一阶梯度上的二阶梯度投影(PSF)，并自适应地重用PSF和及时更新PSF

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100等数据集上达到与SAM相当的准确率，速度提升约40%，在人体姿态估计、模型量化等挑战性任务中同样有效

Conclusion: ARSAM在保持SAM泛化优势的同时显著加速训练，具有广泛的实用性

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization but doubles
the computational cost of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by requiring twice
the gradient calculations per optimization step. To mitigate this, we propose
Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly
accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can
be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order
gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the
SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the
growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed
to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves
state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network
architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a
speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various
challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization)
without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The

Conclusion: CoPA框架通过多层概念提取和提示引导机制，显著提升了医学诊断模型的概念捕获能力和诊断性能

Abstract: The transparency of deep learning models is essential for clinical
diagnostics. Concept Bottleneck Model provides clear decision-making processes
for diagnosis by transforming the latent space of black-box models into
human-understandable concepts. However, concept-based methods still face
challenges in concept capture capabilities. These methods often rely on encode
features solely from the final layer, neglecting shallow and multiscale
features, and lack effective guidance in concept encoding, hindering
fine-grained concept extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Concept
Prompting and Aggregating (CoPA), a novel framework designed to capture
multilayer concepts under prompt guidance. This framework utilizes the
Concept-aware Embedding Generator (CEG) to extract concept representations from
each layer of the visual encoder. Simultaneously, these representations serve
as prompts for Concept Prompt Tuning (CPT), steering the model towards
amplifying critical concept-related visual cues. Visual representations from
each layer are aggregated to align with textual concept representations. With
the proposed method, valuable concept-wise information in the images is
captured and utilized effectively, thus improving the performance of concept
and disease prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CoPA
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets. Code is

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of medical imaging datasets, particularly
in 3D formats, present significant barriers to collaborative research and
transferability. This study investigates whether the ZFP compression technique
can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated
cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm
detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a
large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical
dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation
quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed
baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can
achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance
mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice
coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a
viable and powerful tool for enabling more efficient and accessible research on
large-scale medical datasets, fostering broader collaboration across the

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown near-expert performance in
segmenting complex medical tissues and tumors. However, existing models are
often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical
regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging,
particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are
critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation
architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs,
Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture
local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN
decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual
consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by
emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both
encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale
communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and
generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By
effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a
practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code
and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support
reproducibility and further research.

Method: 采用YOLOv9算法配合多边形标注（而非传统边界框）进行更精确的定位，在包含1000多张图像的数据集上训练三个类别（损坏、未损坏、井盖）。

Result: 整体图像级准确率78.1%，损坏类F1分数86.7%，未损坏类89.2%，井盖类因类别不平衡仅18.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法为发展中国家城市基础设施监测提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart
city development. Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly
costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for
automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with
polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ
polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop
a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly
collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based
model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve
78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong
performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score)
classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class
imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for
monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.

*Venkata Narendra Kotyada,Revanth Eranki,Nagesh Bhattu Sristy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对比学习和分数扩散模型的无配对图像翻译方法，通过时间相关的对比学习保留领域不变特征，并用对比模型指导预训练的SDE进行图像翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无配对图像翻译需要在不使用对齐样本的情况下学习源域和目标域之间的映射。扩散模型能生成高质量多样化的输出，对比学习能学习语义相似性，两者都适合无配对场景。

Method: 使用时间相关的对比学习方法，将图像与其领域不变特征作为正样本对进行SimCLR训练，然后使用学习到的对比模型指导预训练的随机微分方程进行图像翻译。

Result: 在三个常见的无配对图像翻译任务上与多个基线方法进行比较，使用四个评估指标。Contrastive-SDE在多个指标上达到与最先进方法相当的结果，收敛速度显著更快，且无需标签监督或分类器训练。

Conclusion: 该方法为无配对图像翻译任务提供了一个更高效的替代方案，结合了对比学习和扩散模型的优势，实现了快速收敛和无监督学习。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation involves learning mappings between source
domain and target domain in the absence of aligned or corresponding samples.
Score based diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
generative tasks. Their ability to approximate complex data distributions
through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) enables them to generate
high-fidelity and diverse outputs, making them particularly well-suited for
unpaired I2I settings. In parallel, contrastive learning provides a powerful
framework for learning semantic similarities without the need for explicit
supervision or paired data. By pulling together representations of semantically
similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, contrastive methods are
inherently aligned with the objectives of unpaired translation. Its ability to
selectively enforce semantic consistency at the feature level makes contrastive
learning particularly effective for guiding generation in unpaired scenarios.
In this work, we propose a time-dependent contrastive learning approach where a
model is trained with SimCLR by considering an image and its domain invarient
feature as a positive pair, enabling the preservation of domain-invariant
features and the discarding of domain-specific ones. The learned contrastive
model then guides the inference of a pretrained SDE for the I2I translation
task. We empirically compare Contrastive-SDE with several baselines across
three common unpaired I2I tasks, using four metrics for evaluation.
Constrastive-SDE achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art on several
metrics. Furthermore, we observe that our model converges significantly faster
and requires no label supervision or classifier training, making it a more
efficient alternative for this task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIBERO-PRO是一个扩展的VLA模型基准测试，通过系统性的扰动评估发现现有模型在标准测试中表现优异，但在泛化设置下性能崩溃至0%，揭示了模型依赖训练数据的机械记忆而非真正理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LIBERO基准测试的训练和评估设置存在问题，导致性能估计虚高且无法公平比较模型。需要更严格的评估方法来测试模型的泛化能力和真实理解。

Method: 引入LIBERO-PRO基准，在四个维度上系统评估模型性能：操纵对象、初始状态、任务指令和环境。通过合理的扰动来测试模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有模型在标准LIBERO评估中达到90%以上准确率，但在广义设置下性能崩溃至0.0%。模型表现出对训练数据中动作序列和环境布局的机械记忆依赖。

Conclusion: 当前评估实践存在严重缺陷，需要放弃误导性方法，采用更稳健的评估来测试模型的泛化能力和理解能力。

Abstract: LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and
evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance
estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we
introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically
evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four
dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and
environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models
achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their
performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this
discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action
sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine
task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in
executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant
items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted
instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in
current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon
misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization
and comprehension. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成图像越来越难以被标准检测器识别，但人类仍能辨别。为识别这种差异，需要研究更有效的检测方法。

Method: 构建Mirage数据集，包含多样化的AI生成图像；研究大型视觉语言模型在AI图像检测中的应用，特别关注其解释性能力。

Result: 大型视觉语言模型能有效检测具有可见伪影的AI生成图像，但在面对无伪影图像时性能下降。

Conclusion: 大型视觉语言模型在AI图像检测方面有潜力，特别是对有伪影的图像，但对高质量无伪影图像的检测仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models have led to models that produce
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult for standard AI detectors to
identify, even though they often remain distinguishable by humans. To identify
this discrepancy, we introduce \textbf{Mirage}, a curated dataset comprising a
diverse range of AI-generated images exhibiting visible artifacts, where
current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we
investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are
increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can
be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage
and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly
effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their
performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.

*Rui Qian,Xin Yin,Chuanhang Deng,Zhiyuan Peng,Jian Xiong,Wei Zhai,Dejing Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UGround提出了一种统一的视觉定位范式，通过动态选择展开transformer中的中间层作为"mask as prompt"，解决了现有方法依赖固定最后一层和"<SEG> as prompt"的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法存在两个主要问题：(1)依赖固定最后一隐藏层，导致层间传播误差累积；(2)使用<SEG>作为提示，缺乏明确的空间线索。

Method: 提出Policy-Prompted Masking，包含两个关键组件：Stochastic Skip Connection（SSC）通过强化学习策略动态选择连接层，Mask as Prompt（MasP）使用相似度图作为软逻辑掩码来提示SAM生成掩码。

Result: UGround首次在单一框架内统一了从传统参考表达分割到推理分割、单目标到多目标、正查询到错误前提等多种视觉定位任务。

Conclusion: UGround通过动态层选择和明确空间线索，有效解决了现有视觉定位方法的局限性，提供了一个统一的解决方案。

Abstract: We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm
that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled
transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that
leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{<SEG>} as prompt''. UGround
addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its
reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies
cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate
correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly
projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues
(\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which
comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as
Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic
sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer
layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision
model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer,
MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image
tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering
explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the
effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding
within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from
traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning
segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise
(empty target). All codes and models are publicly available at

TL;DR: OMG4是一个优化的4D高斯泼溅框架，通过三阶段渐进式高斯修剪（采样、剪枝、合并）和隐式外观压缩技术，显著减少模型存储大小超过60%同时保持重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D高斯泼溅技术面临存储开销大的挑战，需要数百万高斯点进行高保真重建。现有方法在压缩比或视觉质量方面仍有局限。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进式高斯修剪：高斯采样识别关键基元、高斯剪枝去除冗余、高斯合并融合相似特征。结合隐式外观压缩和广义子向量量化技术。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上的实验表明，OMG4显著优于现有最先进方法，模型大小减少超过60%同时保持重建质量。

Conclusion: OMG4在紧凑4D场景表示方面迈出了重要一步，为广泛应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene
representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions.
However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of
Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies
have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in
compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized
Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of
salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our
method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to
identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning
to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with
similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance
compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations,
further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms
recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while
maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a
significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new
possibilities for a wide range of applications. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的开放词汇目标检测框架，通过结构化领域对齐将地面视图的预训练模型知识迁移到航空图像领域，解决了跨域目标检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测模型在固定类别集上训练，缺乏灵活性且扩展成本高。开放词汇目标检测能够识别未见类别，但航空图像与地面视图之间存在领域偏移、视角变化和尺度差异，需要专门的适应策略。

Method: 采用对比性图像到图像对齐增强航空与地面视图嵌入的相似性，并使用多实例词汇关联将航空图像与文本嵌入对齐，实现结构化领域对齐。

Result: 在xView、DOTAv2、VisDrone、DIOR和HRRSD数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性，在零样本设置下相比微调的封闭词汇模型，在DOTAv2上提升+6.32 mAP，VisDrone上+4.16 mAP，HRRSD上+3.46 mAP。

Conclusion: 该方法为航空应用中的目标检测系统提供了更灵活和可扩展的解决方案，通过有效的跨域知识迁移实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Traditional object detection models are typically trained on a fixed set of
classes, limiting their flexibility and making it costly to incorporate new
categories. Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by
enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training.
Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available
ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for
open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint
variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across
domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary
representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial
imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive
image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and
ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to
align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView,
DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach.
Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16
mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when
compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance,
thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in
aerial applications.

Conclusion: SDAKD通过引入学生判别器有效缓解了容量不匹配问题，为GAN压缩提供了新思路

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieve excellent performance in
generative tasks, such as image super-resolution, but their computational
requirements make difficult their deployment on resource-constrained devices.
While knowledge distillation is a promising research direction for GAN
compression, effectively training a smaller student generator is challenging
due to the capacity mismatch between the student generator and the teacher
discriminator. In this work, we propose Student Discriminator Assisted
Knowledge Distillation (SDAKD), a novel GAN distillation methodology that
introduces a student discriminator to mitigate this capacity mismatch. SDAKD
follows a three-stage training strategy, and integrates an adapted feature map
distillation approach in its last two training stages. We evaluated SDAKD on
two well-performing super-resolution GANs, GCFSR and Real-ESRGAN. Our
experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over the baselines and SOTA GAN
knowledge distillation methods. The SDAKD source code will be made openly
available upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Diagnosing ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) requires a
comprehensive analysis of both head pose and ocular movements. However,
existing datasets focus on these aspects separately, limiting the development
of integrated diagnostic approaches and restricting AI-driven advancements in
AHP analysis. To address this gap, we introduce PoseGaze-AHP, a novel 3D
dataset that synchronously captures head pose and gaze movement information for
ocular-induced AHP assessment. Structured clinical data were extracted from
medical literature using large language models (LLMs) through an iterative
process with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, combining stepwise, hierarchical, and
complex prompting strategies. The extracted records were systematically imputed
and transformed into 3D representations using the Neural Head Avatar (NHA)
framework. The dataset includes 7,920 images generated from two head textures,
covering a broad spectrum of ocular conditions. The extraction method achieved
an overall accuracy of 91.92%, demonstrating its reliability for clinical
dataset construction. PoseGaze-AHP is the first publicly available resource
tailored for AI-driven ocular-induced AHP diagnosis, supporting the development
of accurate and privacy-compliant diagnostic tools.

Conclusion: 该研究为动态4D数字人质量评估提供了首个大规模数据集和有效的多模态评估方法，为相关应用领域提供了重要支持。

Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D scanning and reconstruction technologies,
dynamic digital human avatars based on 4D meshes have become increasingly
popular. A high-precision dynamic digital human avatar can be applied to
various fields such as game production, animation generation, and remote
immersive communication. However, these 4D human avatar meshes are prone to
being degraded by various types of noise during the processes of collection,
compression, and transmission, thereby affecting the viewing experience of
users. In light of this fact, quality assessment of dynamic 4D digital humans
becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale
dynamic digital human quality assessment dataset, DHQA-4D, which contains 32
high-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D
human meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their
corresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs). Equipped
with DHQA-4D dataset, we analyze the influence of different types of distortion
on human perception for textured dynamic 4D meshes and non-textured dynamic 4D
meshes. Additionally, we propose DynaMesh-Rater, a novel large multimodal model
(LMM) based approach that is able to assess both textured 4D meshes and
non-textured 4D meshes. Concretely, DynaMesh-Rater elaborately extracts
multi-dimensional features, including visual features from a projected 2D
video, motion features from cropped video clips, and geometry features from the
4D human mesh to provide comprehensive quality-related information. Then we
utilize a LMM model to integrate the multi-dimensional features and conduct a
LoRA-based instruction tuning technique to teach the LMM model to predict the
quality scores. Extensive experimental results on the DHQA-4D dataset
demonstrate the superiority of our DynaMesh-Rater method over previous quality
assessment methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可泛化动作专家的框架，使用稀疏3D轨迹作为中间表示，将VLM的高级规划能力与低级物理动作模块连接起来，解决了传统VLA模型泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉-语言-动作模型将推理和动作集成在单一架构中，由于受限于稀缺的窄领域数据而泛化能力差。双系统方法虽然尝试解耦"思考"和"行动"，但动作模块存在语义模糊性，导致大规模跨任务训练不可行。

Method: 使用稀疏3D路径点作为中间表示，VLM仅需生成粗略的3D路径点，然后由可泛化动作专家通过采样实时点云观测将其细化为密集可执行动作序列。采用"动作预训练、点云微调"的新范式。

Result: 该方法结合了VLM在视觉理解和规划方面的广泛泛化能力，以及动作专家在细粒度动作级别的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过引入可泛化动作专家和3D轨迹中间表示，有效解决了VLA模型在物理世界部署时的泛化问题，无需在新环境中收集数据进行微调。

Abstract: Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning
and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world
introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture,
generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data.
While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from
"acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action
module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible.
Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly
collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation
mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these
limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a
generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an
intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning
capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the
planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These
waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines
them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud
observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust
generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud
Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization
capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the
fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

Motivation: 皮肤癌分类面临类间相似性高、类内变异性大以及皮肤镜图像噪声等挑战，需要更有效的特征表示方法。

Method: 采用双分支设计融合高级语义和中级细节特征，通过全局平均池化和全连接层生成自适应权重进行加权融合，增强特征学习并减少噪声影响。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算机辅助皮肤癌诊断提供了更有效和高效的解决方案，Grad-CAM验证显示模型能自适应关注病变相关区域并抑制背景信息。

Abstract: Skin cancer classification remains a challenging problem due to high
inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and image noise in dermoscopic
images. To address these issues, we propose an improved ResNet-50 model
enhanced with Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF), which adaptively
integrates multi-scale semantic and surface features to improve feature
representation and reduce overfitting. The ResNet-50 model is enhanced with an
adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve more effective multi-scale feature
extraction and improve overall performance. Specifically, a dual-branch design
fuses high-level semantic and mid-level detail features, which are processed
through global average pooling and fully connected layers to generate adaptive
weights for weighted fusion, thereby strengthening feature learning and
reducing the impact of noise on classification. The method is evaluated on a
subset of the ISIC 2020 dataset containing 3297 benign and malignant skin
lesion images. Experimental results show that the proposed ASFF-based ResNet-50
achieves the best overall performance compared with 5 classic convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) models. The proposed model reached an accuracy of 93.18%
along with higher precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The improved
model achieves an AUC value of 0.9670 and 0.9717 in the P-R and ROC curve,
respectively. Then, the evaluation based on Grad-CAM further proved that the
improved model adaptively focuses on lesion-relevant regions while suppressing
irrelevant background information, thereby validating its enhanced feature

TL;DR: OpenFLAME是一个联邦视觉定位系统后端，允许独立组织扫描和维护自己的空间VPS服务，解决集中式VPS在隐私、法规和维护方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式VPS无法覆盖私人室内空间，存在隐私担忧、法规限制和维护瓶颈。需要分布式解决方案来扩大覆盖范围并保护隐私。

Method: 提出联邦图像定位概念，采用分片VPS服务架构，各组织维护独立的VPS服务，通过参考解决方案管理和合并地图数据而不共享私有数据。

Result: 实现了分布式VPS维护，支持室内空间访问控制，解决了跨空间定位结果一致性、服务质量控制和位置服务选择等挑战。

Conclusion: 联邦VPS方法能够扩大覆盖范围，保护隐私，并支持分布式维护，为大规模AR应用提供可行的定位后端解决方案。

Abstract: World-scale augmented reality (AR) applications need a ubiquitous 6DoF
localization backend to anchor content to the real world consistently across
devices. Large organizations such as Google and Niantic are 3D scanning outdoor
public spaces in order to build their own Visual Positioning Systems (VPS).
These centralized VPS solutions fail to meet the needs of many future AR
applications -- they do not cover private indoor spaces because of privacy
concerns, regulations, and the labor bottleneck of updating and maintaining 3D
scans. In this paper, we present OpenFLAME, a federated VPS backend that allows
independent organizations to 3D scan and maintain a separate VPS service for
their own spaces. This enables access control of indoor 3D scans, distributed
maintenance of the VPS backend, and encourages larger coverage. Sharding of VPS
services introduces several unique challenges -- coherency of localization
results across spaces, quality control of VPS services, selection of the right
VPS service for a location, and many others. We introduce the concept of
federated image-based localization and provide reference solutions for managing
and merging data across maps without sharing private data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 口腔鳞状细胞癌晚期诊断导致高死亡率，超过50%病例在晚期发现，5年生存率低于50%，需要改进早期检测方法。

Method: 使用公开数据集训练三个DenseNet-121 CNN，分别对应不同医学成像模态，采用数据增强和模态特定预处理，通过验证加权集成策略融合预测结果。

Result: 放射学模态验证准确率100%，病理学模态95.12%，临床图像63.10%（因视觉异质性），集成模型在多模态验证集上总体准确率达84.58%。

Conclusion: 多模态集成框架提供非侵入性AI辅助分诊工具，增强高风险病变的早期识别，支持临床决策，符合全球肿瘤学指南以减少诊断延迟并改善患者预后。

Abstract: Aims Late diagnosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) contributes
significantly to its high global mortality rate, with over 50\% of cases
detected at advanced stages and a 5-year survival rate below 50\% according to
WHO statistics. This study aims to improve early detection of OSCC by
developing a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates clinical,
radiological, and histopathological images using a weighted ensemble of
DenseNet-121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Material and Methods A
retrospective study was conducted using publicly available datasets
representing three distinct medical imaging modalities. Each modality-specific
dataset was used to train a DenseNet-121 CNN via transfer learning.
Augmentation and modality-specific preprocessing were applied to increase
robustness. Predictions were fused using a validation-weighted ensemble
strategy. Evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Results High validation accuracy was achieved for radiological (100\%) and
histopathological (95.12\%) modalities, with clinical images performing lower
(63.10\%) due to visual heterogeneity. The ensemble model demonstrated improved
diagnostic robustness with an overall accuracy of 84.58\% on a multimodal
validation dataset of 55 samples. Conclusion The multimodal ensemble framework
bridges gaps in the current diagnostic workflow by offering a non-invasive,
AI-assisted triage tool that enhances early identification of high-risk
lesions. It supports clinicians in decision-making, aligning with global
oncology guidelines to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文挑战了扩展定律，提出了一种基于聚类的数据选择方法IQA-Select，用于可解释图像质量评估，仅需10%的数据即可达到甚至超过全量数据微调的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可解释图像质量评估方法依赖大规模指令调优数据，但这会导致高昂计算成本和数据冗余问题，反而损害模型性能。

Method: 提出三阶段聚类数据选择框架：聚类特征提取、聚类配额分配、聚类采样策略，并开发了IQA-Select方法。

Result: 在Q-Bench和AesBench数据集上，仅使用10%的选定数据就能分别达到全量微调102.1%和103.7%的性能。

Conclusion: 数据质量比数据量更重要，IQA-Select方法能显著降低计算成本同时获得更好性能，证明了可解释IQA中数据选择的有效性。

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), explainable image quality assessment (IQA) has
gradually become popular, aiming at providing quality-related descriptions and
answers of images. To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a
large-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality
perception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large
amount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and
redundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model.
To cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and
systematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning
dataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first
investigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different
sizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data
set randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than
training with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the
redundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly
sampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with
three stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and
cluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each
stage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for
explainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can
achieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10%
selected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing
computational costs while achieving better performance.

TL;DR: 提出RAP方法，通过轻量级3D栅格化和特征对齐技术，为端到端驾驶规划提供可扩展的数据增强方案，无需逼真渲染即可提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习缺乏恢复数据，小错误会累积导致失败。现有基于神经渲染或游戏引擎的方法成本高且主要用于评估，而驾驶规划实际上更依赖几何和动态信息而非纹理光照。

Method: 使用3D栅格化替代昂贵渲染，生成反事实恢复机动和跨智能体视图合成；引入栅格到真实特征空间对齐来弥合仿真与现实的差距。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2、Waymo Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving和Bench2Drive四个主要基准测试中排名第一，实现了最先进的闭环鲁棒性和长尾泛化能力。

Conclusion: 轻量级栅格化配合特征对齐足以扩展端到端训练，为逼真渲染提供了实用替代方案。

Abstract: Imitation learning for end-to-end driving trains policies only on expert
demonstrations. Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery
data: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A
promising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories
beyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via
neural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and
costly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that
photorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is
semantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics,
not textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which
replaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated
primitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers
and cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively
to real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment
that bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization
Augmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning.
RAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail
generalization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo
Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive. Our results show that
lightweight rasterization with feature alignment suffices to scale E2E
training, offering a practical alternative to photorealistic rendering. Project

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在视觉语言推理任务中表现出色，但其在需要精确区分视觉相似类别的零样本细粒度图像分类任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 将零样本细粒度图像分类转化为视觉问答框架，利用LVLMs的综合理解能力而非直接生成类别名称，并采用新颖的注意力干预技术来增强模型性能。

Result: 在多个细粒度图像分类基准测试中，该方法始终优于当前最优方法，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅证明了自身有效性，还展示了大视觉语言模型在零样本细粒度分类任务中的更广泛潜力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on vision-language reasoning tasks. However, their potential for zero-shot
fine-grained image classification, a challenging task requiring precise
differentiation between visually similar categories, remains underexplored. We
present a novel method that transforms zero-shot fine-grained image
classification into a visual question-answering framework, leveraging LVLMs'
comprehensive understanding capabilities rather than relying on direct class
name generation. We enhance model performance through a novel attention
intervention technique. We also address a key limitation in existing datasets
by developing more comprehensive and precise class description benchmarks. We
validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation
across multiple fine-grained image classification benchmarks. Our proposed
method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach,
demonstrating both the effectiveness of our method and the broader potential of
LVLMs for zero-shot fine-grained classification tasks. Code and Datasets:

TL;DR: 该论文对雾天自动驾驶感知系统中的去雾方法进行了系统评估，比较了传统滤波器、现代去雾网络、级联方法和VLM图像编辑模型，发现图像质量提升并不总是能改善下游检测和分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雾天条件下自动驾驶感知系统性能下降，现有去雾方法在图像保真度上的改进并不总能转化为更好的下游任务性能，且大多基于合成数据评估，缺乏真实世界的可迁移性验证。

Method: 使用Foggy Cityscapes数据集，系统评估了四类去雾流程：(i)传统滤波器、(ii)现代去雾网络、(iii)级联变体、(iv)VLM图像编辑模型，同时评估图像质量和下游任务性能。

Result: 分析揭示了去雾何时有效、级联何时产生协同或退化效应，以及VLM编辑器与专用方法的比较。VLM评判的定性评分与任务指标有强相关性，特别是与mAP相关性强。

Conclusion: 研究为去雾方法建立了透明、面向任务的基准，明确了在何种条件下预处理能真正改善恶劣天气下的自动驾驶感知性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy
conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details
critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from
handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image
fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and
segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving
questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical
study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical
filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants
(filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven
visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images.
Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance
on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals
when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how
VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate
qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment
with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these
results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods
and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves
autonomous perception in adverse weather.

Motivation: 尽管视频扩散模型发展迅速，但在通用人体视频生成方面仍未被充分探索，大多数工作局限于图像到视频设置或舞蹈视频等狭窄领域。

Method: 提出CAMEO分层框架，分析并准备文本提示和视觉条件来有效训练视频扩散模型，引入相机感知条件模块连接两个阶段，自动选择与输入文本对齐的视点。

Conclusion: CAMEO框架成功地将文本到运动模型与条件视频扩散模型连接起来，通过精心设计的组件提高了人体运动视频生成的鲁棒性和一致性。

Abstract: Human video generation is becoming an increasingly important task with broad
applications in graphics, entertainment, and embodied AI. Despite the rapid
progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human
video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to
image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we
propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation.
It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs,
mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both
training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we
analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively
train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions,
conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a
camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically
selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and
reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the
T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use
cases.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在需要细粒度时间理解的任务上表现不佳，主要因为缺乏视觉复杂性和时间细节的训练数据，导致模型过度依赖语言推理而非真正理解视频动态

Method: 提出TimeWarp方法，系统性地创建针对性合成时间数据集，构建大规模偏好数据集来捕捉常被忽略的复杂时间动态，将模型响应基于视觉和时间信息

Result: 应用该方法后，在时间理解基准测试中性能显著提升，在七个基准测试中实现了绝对性能改进

Conclusion: TimeWarp方法有效推进了视频大语言模型的时间理解能力，证明了所提出数据集在提升时间理解方面的有效性

Abstract: While Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across general video understanding benchmarks-particularly in video
captioning and descriptive tasks-they consistently underperform on tasks that
require fine-grained temporal understanding. This limitation arises due to the
lack of visual complexity and temporal nuance in current fine-tuning datasets,
leading these models to rely heavily on language-based reasoning rather than
truly understanding video dynamics. In this work, we propose TimeWarp, a
systematic method to create a targeted synthetic temporal dataset to fine-tune
the model's responses to encourage it to focus on the given input video. We
introduce a large-scale preference dataset, created using TimeWarp, that
captures intricate temporal dynamics often overlooked, grounding the model's
responses to visual and temporal information. We demonstrate that when our
method is applied to existing models, it significantly improves performance on
temporal understanding benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our
proposed datasets in advancing temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, resulting
in an absolute improvement in performance across seven benchmarks. Code is

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在生物医学视觉语言模型中扩展文本编码器上下文长度的影响，发现更长的上下文能带来更好的检索和分类性能，并提出了BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集和BMC-LongCLIP模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型通常使用短文本窗口（<77个token）进行预训练，这导致长格式的生物医学描述被截断。然而，大规模开源文献中的生物医学描述有很大部分远超77个token，因此需要研究长上下文预训练的影响。

Method: 扩展视觉语言模型中文本编码器的上下文长度，创建BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集（包含100万个图像-描述对，具有来自全文文章的上下文感知描述），并训练BMC-LongCLIP模型，支持最多512个token的文本窗口。

Result: BMC-LongCLIP将上下文容量扩展了6.6倍，token浪费从55%减少到2.2%。在长描述检索基准测试中，Recall@1绝对增益高达+30%，分类平均改进+2%，同时收敛速度比短上下文模型更快。

Conclusion: 长上下文建模是推进生物医学视觉语言模型发展的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short
text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions.
Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source
literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To
this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical
captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that
longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format
captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance.
Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M
image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text
articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using
BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a
text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context
capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption
retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in
Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging
faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling
is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.

Motivation: 现有长尾半监督学习方法假设未标记数据遵循特定预定义分布，但实际上未标记数据的分布通常是未知且任意的，这限制了现有方法的实际应用效果。

Method: 采用可控自增强优化循环：动态可控过滤机制选择可靠伪标签构建已知分布的标记数据集；使用对数调整构建贝叶斯最优分类器；结合类感知自适应增强模块和辅助分支最大化数据利用率。

Result: 在多个常用基准数据集上的综合评估表明，CPG实现了持续改进，在准确率上比最先进方法高出最多15.97%。

Conclusion: CPG框架通过可控伪标签生成和优化循环，有效解决了未标记数据分布未知的问题，显著提升了长尾半监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data
exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical
predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed).
However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may
follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled
dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the
unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a
known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution.
Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization
cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism
selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into
the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known
distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit
adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved
classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next
training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can
significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions.
Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further
improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to
maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples.
Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that
CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up
to \textbf{15.97\%} in accuracy. The code is available at

Abstract: Recognizing and processing Classical Chinese (Han-Nom) texts play a vital
role in digitizing Vietnamese historical documents and enabling cross-lingual
semantic research. However, existing OCR systems struggle with degraded scans,
non-standard glyphs, and handwriting variations common in ancient sources. In
this work, we propose a fine-tuning approach for PaddleOCRv5 to improve
character recognition on Han-Nom texts. We retrain the text recognition module
using a curated subset of ancient Vietnamese Chinese manuscripts, supported by
a full training pipeline covering preprocessing, LMDB conversion, evaluation,
and visualization. Experimental results show a significant improvement over the
base model, with exact accuracy increasing from 37.5 percent to 50.0 percent,
particularly under noisy image conditions. Furthermore, we develop an
interactive demo that visually compares pre- and post-fine-tuning recognition
results, facilitating downstream applications such as Han-Vietnamese semantic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示在信号表示方面表现出色，但不适合分割等预测任务。需要一种方法让INR能够学习信号分布上的语义结构。

Method: 使用基础INR同时预测像素强度值和类别标签，通过元学习过程在训练数据集上找到最优初始参数，使INR只需微调即可适应新图像并自动解码类别标签。

Result: 在2D和3D脑MRI分割任务上评估，Dice分数与常用U-Net模型相当，但参数数量减少90%。

Conclusion: MetaSeg为医学图像分割提供了一个新颖、可扩展的替代方案，相比传统的U-Net和视觉变换器等资源密集型架构更具优势。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have achieved remarkable successes in
learning expressive yet compact signal representations. However, they are not
naturally amenable to predictive tasks such as segmentation, where they must
learn semantic structures over a distribution of signals. In this study, we
introduce MetaSeg, a meta-learning framework to train INRs for medical image
segmentation. MetaSeg uses an underlying INR that simultaneously predicts per
pixel intensity values and class labels. It then uses a meta-learning procedure
to find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of
images and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit
pixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We
evaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice
scores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\%$ fewer
parameters. MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional
resource-heavy architectures such as U-Nets and vision transformers for medical
image segmentation. Our project is available at

Motivation: 解决长视频问答中的计算效率问题，传统方法处理长视频需要大量计算资源，ViTL旨在在固定token预算下实现更好的性能。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用低帧率浏览定位问题相关时间片段；2) 通过span感知的token重新分配在更高有效帧率下回答问题；采用端到端训练，结合时间IoU和答案正确性的联合目标。

Result: 在固定token预算下，ViTL在长视频问答和时间定位任务上（如Charades-STA、ActivityNet-Captions）获得最高8.6%的性能提升，同时减少50%的帧输入；span感知token重新分配始终优于均匀采样。

Conclusion: ViTL和配套数据集提供了一个可解释、计算高效的解决方案，为可扩展的长视频问答提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We present \emph{Video-in-the-Loop} (ViTL), a two-stage long-video QA
framework that preserves a fixed token budget by first \emph{localizing}
question-relevant interval(s) with a low-fps skim and then \emph{answering} via
span-aware reallocation of visual tokens at higher effective frame rate,
emitting an interleaved output with both spans and the final option for direct
attribution. We also introduce \dataname{}, which converts description based
event graphs into \emph{span-grounded} multiple-choice QA by pairing each
question with \emph{ground-truth} time span(s) and related reasoning. ViTL is
trained end-to-end with an interleaved group-relative objective that couples
temporal IoU for localization with answer correctness, allowing credit to flow
from answers back to spans without increasing compute. Under fixed token
budgets, ViTL attains up to 8.6% with 50% less frame input on long-video QA and
temporal grounding (e.g., Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions) and ablations
show that span-aware token reallocation consistently surpasses uniform
sampling. Together, \dataname{} and ViTL provide an interpretable,
compute-efficient recipe for scalable long-video QA.

TL;DR: 提出AgentAug数据增强框架，通过模拟典型创作过程生成多样化假新闻视频，结合主动学习策略提升短视频假新闻检测器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻检测器因训练数据有限且多样性不足，导致模式偏见和性能受限。真实场景中视频素材与虚假新闻事件存在复杂多对多关系，但现有数据集未能充分反映这种关系。

Method: 使用多LLM驱动流水线模拟四种伪造类别的新闻视频创作过程，结合基于不确定性采样的主动学习策略选择有用的增强样本。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，AgentAug能持续提升短视频假新闻检测器的性能。

Conclusion: AgentAug通过数据增强有效解决了假新闻检测中的数据稀疏性问题，为短视频平台假新闻检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of fake news on short video platforms has become a new
significant societal concern, necessitating automatic video-news-specific
detection. Current detectors primarily rely on pattern-based features to
separate fake news videos from real ones. However, limited and less diversified
training data lead to biased patterns and hinder their performance. This
weakness stems from the complex many-to-many relationships between video
material segments and fabricated news events in real-world scenarios: a single
video clip can be utilized in multiple ways to create different fake
narratives, while a single fabricated event often combines multiple distinct
video segments. However, existing datasets do not adequately reflect such
relationships due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating large-scale
real-world data, resulting in sparse coverage and non-comprehensive learning of
the characteristics of potential fake news video creation. To address this
issue, we propose a data augmentation framework, AgentAug, that generates
diverse fake news videos by simulating typical creative processes. AgentAug
implements multiple LLM-driven pipelines of four fabrication categories for
news video creation, combined with an active learning strategy based on
uncertainty sampling to select the potentially useful augmented samples during
training. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AgentAug consistently improves the performance of short video fake news
detectors.

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing have shifted from manual pixel manipulation
to employing deep learning methods like stable diffusion models, which now
leverage cross-attention mechanisms for text-driven control. This transition
has simplified the editing process but also introduced variability in results,
such as inconsistent hair color changes. Our research aims to enhance the
precision and reliability of prompt-to-prompt image editing frameworks by
exploring and optimizing hyperparameters. We present a comprehensive study of
the "word swap" method, develop an "attention re-weight method" for better
adaptability, and propose the "CL P2P" framework to address existing
limitations like cycle inconsistency. This work contributes to understanding
and improving the interaction between hyperparameter settings and the
architectural choices of neural network models, specifically their attention
mechanisms, which significantly influence the composition and quality of the
generated images.

TL;DR: GUI-Spotlight是一个用于图像推理的模型，通过动态调用多个专用工具来迭代缩小屏幕相关区域，显著提高视觉定位准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图形用户界面系统中的实际应用受到视觉定位可靠性的限制，无法准确执行指针级操作如点击或拖动。

Method: 训练GUI-Spotlight模型进行图像推理，动态调用多个专用工具来迭代缩小屏幕相关区域的焦点。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro基准测试中，仅使用18.5K训练样本的GUI-Spotlight达到52.8%准确率，超越V2P-7B（50.6%，使用9.6M样本）和GTA-1-7B（50.1%，使用1.56M样本）。

Conclusion: GUI-Spotlight通过迭代聚焦方法显著提高了视觉定位准确性，在少量训练数据下超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have markedly expanded the
competence of graphical user-interface (GUI) systems, propelling them beyond
controlled simulations into complex, real-world environments across diverse
platforms. However, practical usefulness is still bounded by the reliability of
visual grounding, i.e., mapping textual references to exact on-screen elements.
This limitation prevents the system from accurately performing pointer-level
actions such as clicking or dragging. To address it, we introduce GUI-Spotlight
-- a model trained for image-grounded reasoning that dynamically invokes
multiple specialized tools to iteratively narrow its focus to the relevant
region of the screen, thereby substantially improving visual grounding
accuracy. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Spotlight trained with only
18.5K training samples achieves 52.8\% accuracy, surpassing V2P-7B (50.6\% with
9.6M training samples) and GTA-1-7B (50.1\% with 1.56M training samples).

Abstract: Post-training quantization for reducing the storage of deep neural network
models has been demonstrated to be an effective way in various tasks. However,
low-bit quantization while maintaining model accuracy is a challenging problem.
In this paper, we present a range estimation method to improve the quantization
performance for post-training quantization. We model the range estimation into
an optimization problem of minimizing quantization errors by layer-wise local
minima. We prove this problem is locally convex and present an efficient search
algorithm to find the optimal solution. We propose the application of the above
search algorithm to the transformed weights space to do further improvement in
practice. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art performance generally on top-1 accuracy for image
classification tasks on the ResNet series models and Inception-v3 model. The
experimental results show that the proposed method has almost no loss of top-1
accuracy in 8-bit and 6-bit settings for image classifications, and the
accuracy of 4-bit quantization is also significantly improved. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D资产检索方法存在的两个核心挑战：(i) 忽视空间、语义和风格约束的不一致资产检索；(ii) 缺乏专门为3D资产检索设计的标准化检索范式。

Method: 提出灵活的检索机制，支持文本、图像和3D模态的任意组合作为查询，通过可插拔的等变布局编码器ESSGNN捕获空间关系和物体外观特征，确保检索的3D资产在上下文和风格上与现有场景一致。

Result: 实证评估表明，MetaFind在各种检索任务中相比基线方法具有更好的空间和风格一致性。

Conclusion: MetaFind通过三模态组合检索和等变布局编码，有效提升了元宇宙场景生成中3D资产检索的空间和风格一致性，支持迭代式场景构建。

Abstract: We present MetaFind, a scene-aware tri-modal compositional retrieval
framework designed to enhance scene generation in the metaverse by retrieving
3D assets from large-scale repositories. MetaFind addresses two core
challenges: (i) inconsistent asset retrieval that overlooks spatial, semantic,
and stylistic constraints, and (ii) the absence of a standardized retrieval
paradigm specifically tailored for 3D asset retrieval, as existing approaches
mainly rely on general-purpose 3D shape representation models. Our key
innovation is a flexible retrieval mechanism that supports arbitrary
combinations of text, image, and 3D modalities as queries, enhancing spatial
reasoning and style consistency by jointly modeling object-level features
(including appearance) and scene-level layout structures. Methodologically,
MetaFind introduces a plug-and-play equivariant layout encoder ESSGNN that
captures spatial relationships and object appearance features, ensuring
retrieved 3D assets are contextually and stylistically coherent with the
existing scene, regardless of coordinate frame transformations. The framework
supports iterative scene construction by continuously adapting retrieval
results to current scene updates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the
improved spatial and stylistic consistency of MetaFind in various retrieval
tasks compared to baseline methods.

Motivation: 传统耀斑预测的二元分类框架忽略了FL和NF类别内子类间的序数关系，且模型在预测阈值附近容易产生误分类。

Method: 在传统二元交叉熵损失基础上，整合耀斑子类的序数信息，创建序数感知的数据驱动正则化方法，对阈值附近的错误预测施加更重惩罚。

Result: 通过将序数加权整合到损失函数中，利用数据的序数特性增强模型学习过程。

Conclusion: 提出的序数感知损失函数能够改善模型在耀斑预测阈值附近的分类性能，提升整体预测效果。

Abstract: The prediction of solar flares is typically formulated as a binary
classification task, distinguishing events as either Flare (FL) or No-Flare
(NF) according to a specified threshold (for example, greater than or equal to
C-class, M-class, or X-class). However, this binary framework neglects the
inherent ordinal relationships among the sub-classes contained within each
category (FL and NF). Several studies on solar flare prediction have
empirically shown that the most frequent misclassifications occur near this
prediction threshold. This suggests that the models struggle to differentiate
events that are similar in intensity but fall on opposite sides of the binary
threshold. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function
that integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized
flare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This
approach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that
penalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the
prediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during
model optimization. By incorporating ordinal weighting into the loss function,
we aim to enhance the model's learning process by leveraging the ordinal
characteristics of the data, thereby improving its overall performance.

Conclusion: 提出的QuantDemoire框架有效解决了去摩尔纹模型量化中的关键问题，实现了在边缘设备上高效部署的去摩尔纹解决方案。

Abstract: Demoir\'eing aims to remove moir\'e artifacts that often occur in images.
While recent deep learning-based methods have achieved promising results, they
typically require substantial computational resources, limiting their
deployment on edge devices. Model quantization offers a compelling solution.
However, directly applying existing quantization methods to demoir\'eing models
introduces severe performance degradation. The main reasons are distribution
outliers and weakened representations in smooth regions. To address these
issues, we propose QuantDemoire, a post-training quantization framework
tailored to demoir\'eing. It contains two key components. **First}, we
introduce an outlier-aware quantizer to reduce errors from outliers. It uses
sampling-based range estimation to reduce activation outliers, and keeps a few
extreme weights in FP16 with negligible cost. **Second**, we design a
frequency-aware calibration strategy. It emphasizes low- and mid-frequency
components during fine-tuning, which mitigates banding artifacts caused by
low-bit quantization. Extensive experiments validate that our QuantDemoire
achieves large reductions in parameters and computation while maintaining
quality. Meanwhile, it outperforms existing quantization methods by over **4
dB** on W4A4. Code is released at:

Conclusion: 扩散模型+TV-LoRA在低剂量稀疏采样场景下实现了高保真、高效的3D CT重建，具有广泛的临床应用前景

Abstract: This work presents TV-LoRA, a novel method for low-dose sparse-view CT
reconstruction that combines a diffusion generative prior (NCSN++ with SDE
modeling) and multi-regularization constraints, including anisotropic TV and
nuclear norm (LoRA), within an ADMM framework. To address ill-posedness and
texture loss under extremely sparse views, TV-LoRA integrates generative and
physical constraints, and utilizes a 2D slice-based strategy with FFT
acceleration and tensor-parallel optimization for efficient inference.
Experiments on AAPM-2016, CTHD, and LIDC datasets with
$N_{\mathrm{view}}=8,4,2$ show that TV-LoRA consistently surpasses benchmarks
in SSIM, texture recovery, edge clarity, and artifact suppression,
demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability. Ablation studies confirm
the complementary effects of LoRA regularization and diffusion priors, while
the FFT-PCG module provides a speedup. Overall, Diffusion + TV-LoRA achieves
high-fidelity, efficient 3D CT reconstruction and broad clinical applicability
in low-dose, sparse-sampling scenarios.

Abstract: Topological mapping offers a compact and robust representation for
navigation, but progress in the field is hindered by the lack of standardized
evaluation metrics, datasets, and protocols. Existing systems are assessed
using different environments and criteria, preventing fair and reproducible
comparisons. Moreover, a key challenge - perceptual aliasing - remains
under-quantified, despite its strong influence on system performance. We
address these gaps by (1) formalizing topological consistency as the
fundamental property of topological maps and showing that localization accuracy
provides an efficient and interpretable surrogate metric, and (2) proposing the
first quantitative measure of dataset ambiguity to enable fair comparisons
across environments. To support this protocol, we curate a diverse benchmark
dataset with calibrated ambiguity levels, implement and release deep-learned
baseline systems, and evaluate them alongside classical methods. Our
experiments and analysis yield new insights into the limitations of current
approaches under perceptual aliasing. All datasets, baselines, and evaluation
tools are fully open-sourced to foster consistent and reproducible research in
topological mapping.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of event-based meshflow estimation, a
novel task that involves predicting a spatially smooth sparse motion field from
event cameras. To start, we review the state-of-the-art in event-based flow
estimation, highlighting two key areas for further research: i) the lack of
meshflow-specific event datasets and methods, and ii) the underexplored
challenge of event data density. First, we generate a large-scale
High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset, which showcases its superiority
by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720, handling dynamic
objects and complex motion patterns, and offering both optical flow and
meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works.
Besides, we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network, a
lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to
facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore, we upgrade
EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow, in which a
Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp
motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional
performance and runtime efficiency (30x faster) of our EEMFlow model compared
to the recent state-of-the-art flow method. As an extension, we expand HREM
into HREM+, a multi-density event dataset contributing to a thorough study of
the robustness of existing methods across data with varying densities, and
propose an Adaptive Density Module (ADM) to adjust the density of input event
data to a more optimal range, enhancing the model's generalization ability. We
empirically demonstrate that ADM helps to significantly improve the performance
of EEMFlow and EEMFlow+ by 8% and 10%, respectively. Code and dataset are

Abstract: Latest diffusion models have shown promising results in category-level 6D
object pose estimation by modeling the conditional pose distribution with depth
image input. The existing methods, however, suffer from slow convergence during
training, learning its encoder with the diffusion denoising network in
end-to-end fashion, and require an additional network that evaluates sampled
pose hypotheses to filter out low-quality pose candidates. In this paper, we
propose a novel pipeline that tackles these limitations by two key components.
First, the proposed method pretrains the encoder with the direct pose
regression head, and jointly learns the networks via the regression head and
the denoising diffusion head, significantly accelerating training convergence
while achieving higher accuracy. Second, sampling guidance via time-dependent
score scaling is proposed s.t. the exploration-exploitation trade-off is
effectively taken, eliminating the need for the additional evaluation network.
The sampling guidance maintains multi-modal characteristics of symmetric
objects at early denoising steps while ensuring high-quality pose generation at
final steps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including REAL275,
HouseCat6D, and ROPE, demonstrate that the proposed method, simple yet
effective, achieves state-of-the-art accuracies even with single-pose
inference, while being more efficient in both training and inference.

Motivation: 多教师蒸馏过程中存在概念漂移问题，即多个教师的推理轨迹分布会不可预测地演变，并将偏差传递给学生模型，最终损害其性能。

Method: 提出自主偏好优化(APO)方法，采用"学习、比较、批判"范式：学生模型首先学习并自我蒸馏偏好的思维，然后对教师的漂移推理进行批判性反思，通过概念对齐实现鲁棒建模。

Conclusion: APO方法能够有效解决多教师蒸馏中的概念漂移问题，产生鲁棒、一致且可泛化的模型，为多模态知识蒸馏提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper identifies a critical yet underexplored challenge in distilling
from multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the reasoning trajectories
generated by multiple drifting teachers exhibit concept drift, whereby their
reasoning distributions evolve unpredictably and transmit biases to the student
model, ultimately compromising its performance. To tackle this issue, we
pioneer a theoretical connection between concept drift and knowledge
distillation, casting the non-stationary reasoning dynamics from multiple MLLM
teachers as next-token prediction of multi-stream reasoning trajectories.Guided
by concept drift, we introduce the "learn, compare, critique" paradigm,
culminating in autonomous preference optimization (APO). Under the active
guidance of the teachers, the student model first learns and self-distils
preferred thinking by comparing multiple teachers. It then engages in critical
reflection over the drifting inference from teachers, performing concept
alignment through APO, ultimately yielding a robust, consistent, and
generalizable model.Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance
of consistency, robustness and generalization within knowledge distillation.
Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset, CXR-MAX (Multi-teachers
Alignment X-rays), comprising 170,982 distilled reasoning trajectories derived
from publicly accessible MLLMs based on MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public

Abstract: Conventional construction safety inspection methods are often inefficient as
they require navigating through large volume of information. Recent advances in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety
inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However,
existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific
responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of
training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces
SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating
visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed
unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04,
precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield
offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in
generating safety reports.

with various blind image restoration (IR) tasks, where they have demonstrated
outstanding performance in terms of perceptual quality. However, the
task-specific nature of existing solutions and the excessive computational
costs related to their training, make such models impractical and challenging
to use for different IR tasks than those that were initially trained for. This
hinders their wider adoption, especially by those who lack access to powerful
computational resources and vast amount of training data. In this work we aim
to address the above issues and enable the successful adoption of DPMs in
practical IR-related applications. Towards this goal, we propose a modular
diffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the
performance benefits of existing pre-trained state-of-the-art IR networks and
generative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a relatively
small module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest.
Moreover, the architecture of the proposed framework allows for a sampling
strategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function
evaluations without suffering any performance loss, while it can also be
combined with existing acceleration techniques such as DDIM. We evaluate our
model on four benchmarks for the tasks of burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene
deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method outperforms existing approaches in
terms of perceptual quality while it retains a competitive performance with
respect to fidelity metrics.

### [96] [BLADE: Bias-Linked Adaptive DEbiasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04174)
*Piyush Arora,Navlika Singh,Vasubhya Diwan,Pratik Mazumder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE是一个无需先验偏见知识或偏见冲突样本的生成式去偏框架，通过生成模型在偏见域间转换图像并保留任务相关特征，自适应地精炼图像以减轻偏见影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络容易学习训练数据中的隐性偏见和伪相关，现有方法通常需要已知偏见或偏见冲突样本，这在现实场景中往往不切实际。

Method: 训练生成模型在偏见域间转换图像，基于图像对偏见的敏感性自适应精炼，通过对齐任务相关特征相同但偏见不同的图像对，同时错开偏见相同的样本来鼓励鲁棒表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，在corrupted CIFAR-10数据集的最差组设置下比最接近的基线绝对提升约18%。

Conclusion: BLADE在无需显式监督的情况下建立了偏见缓解的新基准，展示了开发更鲁棒深度学习模型的潜力。

Abstract: Neural networks have revolutionized numerous fields, yet they remain
vulnerable to a critical flaw: the tendency to learn implicit biases, spurious
correlations between certain attributes and target labels in training data.
These biases are often more prevalent and easier to learn, causing models to
rely on superficial patterns rather than task-relevant features necessary for
generalization. Existing methods typically rely on strong assumptions, such as
prior knowledge of these biases or access to bias-conflicting samples, i.e.,
samples that contradict spurious correlations and counterbalance bias-aligned
samples, samples that conform to these spurious correlations. However, such
assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings. We propose BLADE
({B}ias-{L}inked {A}daptive {DE}biasing), a generative debiasing framework that
requires no prior knowledge of bias or bias-conflicting samples. BLADE first
trains a generative model to translate images across bias domains while
preserving task-relevant features. Then, it adaptively refines each image with
its synthetic counterpart based on the image's susceptibility to bias. To
encourage robust representations, BLADE aligns an image with its
bias-translated synthetic counterpart that shares task-relevant features but
differs in bias, while misaligning it with samples sharing the same bias. We
evaluate BLADE on multiple benchmark datasets and show that it significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it exceeds the closest baseline
by an absolute margin of around 18% on the corrupted CIFAR-10 dataset under the
worst group setting, establishing a new benchmark in bias mitigation and
demonstrating its potential for developing more robust deep learning models
without explicit supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SEG-MIL-CBM框架，通过概念引导的图像分割结合注意力多实例学习，实现无需概念标注的空间概念解释，提高模型透明度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络缺乏决策透明度，在安全关键应用中存在风险。现有概念瓶颈模型需要昂贵的概念标注且缺乏空间定位能力。

Method: 将概念引导的图像分割集成到注意力多实例学习框架中，将分割区域作为实例，学习跨区域证据聚合，实现空间概念推理。

Result: 在虚假相关性、输入损坏和大规模基准测试中实现鲁棒性能，同时提供透明的概念级解释。

Conclusion: SEG-MIL-CBM无需概念或组标注即可产生空间基础的概念级解释，在保持性能的同时显著提高模型透明度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision;
however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and
trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is
crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not
only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading
features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their
explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by
reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly
concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which
regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that
integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple
instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an
instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning
over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our
model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and
produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring
annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance
across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies
between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade
visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent,
concept-level explanations.

TL;DR: HyCa是一个基于混合ODE求解器的缓存框架，通过维度级缓存策略加速扩散变换器的采样过程，实现近无损加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器的迭代采样过程由于每个时间步都需要进行昂贵的变换器前向传播而成为主要瓶颈，现有缓存方法对所有特征维度采用统一策略，忽略了它们不同的动态行为。

Method: 将隐藏特征演化建模为跨维度的ODE混合，引入HyCa框架应用维度级缓存策略。

Result: 在多个领域和模型中实现近无损加速：FLUX加速5.55倍，HunyuanVideo加速5.56倍，Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit加速6.24倍，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: HyCa通过维度级缓存策略有效解决了扩散变换器采样瓶颈，实现了显著的加速效果。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video
synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due
to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate
this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique
that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods
often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring
their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by
modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and
introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies
dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration
across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56
times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and
Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在处理新颖或分布外实体时性能显著下降，因为模型存在固有的知识截止问题，无法准确生成未知概念。

Method: 设计了一个代理动态搜索网络，为基模型未知的概念检索图像，然后进行多模态提示优化，引导强大的生成骨干网络实现准确合成。

Result: 在NICE基准测试中，World-To-Image在语义对齐和视觉美学方面显著优于最先进方法，准确度提升+8.1%，且仅需不到3次迭代即可实现高效结果。

Conclusion: 该框架为文本到图像系统提供了更好反映不断变化的现实世界的能力，实现了高效率和高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models can synthesize high-quality images, their
performance degrades significantly when prompted with novel or
out-of-distribution (OOD) entities due to inherent knowledge cutoffs. We
introduce World-To-Image, a novel framework that bridges this gap by empowering
T2I generation with agent-driven world knowledge. We design an agent that
dynamically searches the web to retrieve images for concepts unknown to the
base model. This information is then used to perform multimodal prompt
optimization, steering powerful generative backbones toward an accurate
synthesis. Critically, our evaluation goes beyond traditional metrics,
utilizing modern assessments like LLMGrader and ImageReward to measure true
semantic fidelity. Our experiments show that World-To-Image substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic alignment and visual
aesthetics, achieving +8.1% improvement in accuracy-to-prompt on our curated
NICE benchmark. Our framework achieves these results with high efficiency in
less than three iterations, paving the way for T2I systems that can better
reflect the ever-changing real world. Our demo code is available

TL;DR: 提出了MASC框架，通过构建层次化语义树来优化自回归图像生成模型的词汇表结构，显著提升训练效率和生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型使用扁平的视觉词汇表，忽略了标记嵌入空间的内在结构，导致预测任务复杂、训练效率低下且生成质量受限

Method: MASC框架使用几何感知距离度量和密度驱动的聚合构建方法，直接从码本内在结构构建层次化语义树，将高维预测任务转化为结构化层次任务

Result: 训练速度提升高达57%，LlamaGen-XL的FID从2.87降至2.58，显著改善生成质量

Conclusion: 结构化预测空间与架构创新同等重要，MASC使现有自回归框架能够与最先进方法竞争

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have shown great promise in image generation, yet
they face a fundamental inefficiency stemming from their core component: a
vast, unstructured vocabulary of visual tokens. This conventional approach
treats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the
token embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic
similarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which
hinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve
this, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled
framework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the
codebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance
metric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying
manifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional
prediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a
beneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem
for the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive
experiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57%
and significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL
from 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly
competitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the
prediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable
generative modeling.

Motivation: AI生成图像的快速增长模糊了真实与合成内容的边界，对数字完整性构成严重威胁。现有的视觉语言模型虽然提供解释性，但往往无法检测高质量合成图像中的细微伪影。

Method: 提出ZoomIn两阶段框架：第一阶段扫描图像定位可疑区域，第二阶段对这些放大区域进行聚焦分析。使用MagniFake数据集（20,000张真实和高质量合成图像，带有边界框和取证解释）进行训练。

Result: 该方法达到96.39%的准确率，具有强大的泛化能力，同时提供基于视觉证据的人类可理解解释。

Conclusion: ZoomIn框架在AI生成图像检测方面实现了高准确性和可解释性的平衡，为数字取证提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI-generated imagery has blurred the boundary between
real and synthetic content, raising critical concerns for digital integrity.
Vision-language models (VLMs) offer interpretability through explanations but
often fail to detect subtle artifacts in high-quality synthetic images. We
propose ZoomIn, a two-stage forensic framework that improves both accuracy and
interpretability. Mimicking human visual inspection, ZoomIn first scans an
image to locate suspicious regions and then performs a focused analysis on
these zoomed-in areas to deliver a grounded verdict. To support training, we
introduce MagniFake, a dataset of 20,000 real and high-quality synthetic images
annotated with bounding boxes and forensic explanations, generated through an
automated VLM-based pipeline. Our method achieves 96.39% accuracy with robust
generalization, while providing human-understandable explanations grounded in
visual evidence.

introduces a simple, end-to-end trainable algorithm that is implementable in a
few lines of Python code. The approach is shown to work with very little
training data and training time, while achieving accurate results in some

excels in brevity and may serve as a good start in related scenarios with
limitations to training data, training time or code complexity.

Result: 模型仅含130万参数，在RfMiD测试集上准确率达到0.9328，优于MobileNetV2的0.9266。

Conclusion: 通过优化卷积层设计，成功开发了适用于移动设备的轻量级高精度眼科疾病诊断模型。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are continually evolving, with some efforts
aimed at improving accuracy, others at increasing speed, and some at enhancing
accessibility. Improving accessibility broadens the application of neural
networks across a wider range of tasks, including the detection of eye
diseases. Early diagnosis of eye diseases and consulting an ophthalmologist can
prevent many vision disorders. Given the importance of this issue, various
datasets have been collected from the cornea to facilitate the process of
making neural network models. However, most of the methods introduced in the
past are computationally complex. In this study, we tried to increase the
accessibility of deep neural network models. We did this at the most
fundamental level, specifically by redesigning and optimizing the convolutional
layers. By doing so, we created a new general model that incorporates our novel
convolutional layer named ArConv layers. Thanks to the efficient performance of
this new layer, the model has suitable complexity for use in mobile phones and
can perform the task of diagnosing the presence of disease with high accuracy.
The final model we present contains only 1.3 million parameters. In comparison
to the MobileNetV2 model, which has 2.2 million parameters, our model
demonstrated better accuracy when trained and evaluated on the RfMiD dataset
under identical conditions, achieving an accuracy of 0.9328 versus 0.9266 on
the RfMiD test set.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过将3D建模视为视频的特殊子域，利用大规模视频数据进行预训练，减少对稀缺的相机标注3D数据的依赖，提高空间一致性。

Method: 采用序列到序列生成方法，使用掩码自回归框架和仅解码器的整流流变换器，统一3D和视频建模，支持任意数量参考视图生成任意数量6-DoF目标视图。

Result: 在多个视图合成基准测试中达到最先进水平，零样本性能在少视图设置中显著优于其他生成方法，在多视图设置中首次达到逐场景优化方法的质量。

Conclusion: Kaleido通过统一3D和视频建模框架，利用视频数据预训练，实现了高质量的生成式神经渲染，为3D内容生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a family of generative models designed for
photorealistic, unified object- and scene-level neural rendering. Kaleido
operates on the principle that 3D can be regarded as a specialised sub-domain
of video, expressed purely as a sequence-to-sequence image synthesis task.
Through a systemic study of scaling sequence-to-sequence generative neural
rendering, we introduce key architectural innovations that enable our model to:
i) perform generative view synthesis without explicit 3D representations; ii)
generate any number of 6-DoF target views conditioned on any number of
reference views via a masked autoregressive framework; and iii) seamlessly
unify 3D and video modelling within a single decoder-only rectified flow
transformer. Within this unified framework, Kaleido leverages large-scale video
data for pre-training, which significantly improves spatial consistency and
reduces reliance on scarce, camera-labelled 3D datasets -- all without any
architectural modifications. Kaleido sets a new state-of-the-art on a range of
view synthesis benchmarks. Its zero-shot performance substantially outperforms
other generative methods in few-view settings, and, for the first time, matches
the quality of per-scene optimisation methods in many-view settings.

Conclusion: CoSSeg-TTA框架有效解决了肝脏分割中的域泛化问题，在有限标注数据下实现了鲁棒且准确的分割性能。

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation from contrast-enhanced MRI is essential for
diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, it remains
challenging due to limited annotated data, heterogeneous enhancement protocols,
and significant domain shifts across scanners and institutions. Traditional
image-to-image translation frameworks have made great progress in domain
generalization, but their application is not straightforward. For example,
Pix2Pix requires image registration, and cycle-GAN cannot be integrated
seamlessly into segmentation pipelines. Meanwhile, these methods are originally
used to deal with cross-modality scenarios, and often introduce structural
distortions and suffer from unstable training, which may pose drawbacks in our
single-modality scenario. To address these challenges, we propose CoSSeg-TTA, a
compact segmentation framework for the GED4 (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary
phase MRI) modality built upon nnU-Netv2 and enhanced with a semi-supervised
mean teacher scheme to exploit large amounts of unlabeled volumes. A domain
adaptation module, incorporating a randomized histogram-based style appearance
transfer function and a trainable contrast-aware network, enriches domain
diversity and mitigates cross-center variability. Furthermore, a continual
test-time adaptation strategy is employed to improve robustness during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms the nnU-Netv2 baseline, achieving superior Dice score and Hausdorff
Distance while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen domains under
low-annotation conditions.

Motivation: 现有的对抗补丁防御方法通常需要预先知道补丁大小或位置，这限制了它们的实际应用。需要开发一种不依赖补丁先验知识的防御方法。

Method: 利用基于概念的解释来识别和抑制最有影响力的概念激活向量，从而在不显式检测补丁的情况下中和补丁攻击效果。

Result: 在Imagenette数据集和ResNet-50模型上的评估显示，该方法在鲁棒性和干净准确率方面均优于最先进的PatchCleanser方法，并且在不同的补丁大小和位置下保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: 将可解释性与鲁棒性相结合具有前景，概念驱动的防御策略为保护机器学习模型免受对抗补丁攻击提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a practical threat to deep learning models by
forcing targeted misclassifications through localized perturbations, often
realized in the physical world. Existing defenses typically assume prior
knowledge of patch size or location, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose a patch-agnostic defense that leverages concept-based
explanations to identify and suppress the most influential concept activation
vectors, thereby neutralizing patch effects without explicit detection.
Evaluated on Imagenette with a ResNet-50, our method achieves higher robust and
clean accuracy than the state-of-the-art PatchCleanser, while maintaining
strong performance across varying patch sizes and locations. Our results
highlight the promise of combining interpretability with robustness and suggest
concept-driven defenses as a scalable strategy for securing machine learning
models against adversarial patch attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的序列视觉地点识别方法虽然性能良好，但缺乏灵活性（无法适应不同序列长度）、推理速度慢且内存使用高，难以满足实时应用需求。

Method: 设计了循环可变形Transformer编码器（Recurrent-DTE），采用迭代循环机制融合多帧序列信息，支持可变序列长度，实现快速推理和低内存使用。

Result: 在Nordland、Oxford和NuScenes数据集上的实验表明，Adapt-STformer相比次优基线方法，召回率提升高达17%，序列提取时间减少36%，内存使用降低35%。

Conclusion: Adapt-STformer在保持高性能的同时，实现了灵活性、效率和低内存使用的平衡，为实时序列视觉地点识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Sequential Visual Place Recognition (Seq-VPR) leverages transformers to
capture spatio-temporal features effectively; however, existing approaches
prioritize performance at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. In
practice, a transformer-based Seq-VPR model should be flexible to the number of
frames per sequence (seq-length), deliver fast inference, and have low memory
usage to meet real-time constraints. To our knowledge, no existing
transformer-based Seq-VPR method achieves both flexibility and efficiency. To
address this gap, we propose Adapt-STformer, a Seq-VPR method built around our
novel Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder (Recurrent-DTE), which uses an
iterative recurrent mechanism to fuse information from multiple sequential
frames. This design naturally supports variable seq-lengths, fast inference,
and low memory usage. Experiments on the Nordland, Oxford, and NuScenes
datasets show that Adapt-STformer boosts recall by up to 17% while reducing
sequence extraction time by 36% and lowering memory usage by 35% compared to
the second-best baseline.

Conclusion: ChronoEdit通过将图像编辑重构为视频生成问题，有效解决了物理一致性问题，为需要物理一致性的图像编辑任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image
editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring
physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This
capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this
paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a
video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images
as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large
pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but
also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal
consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that
explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target
frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing
trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable
transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to
avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate
ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for
contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical
plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit
will be released on the project page:

TL;DR: CARE-PD是首个多中心、最大的公开帕金森病3D步态网格数据集，支持临床评分预测和无监督运动预训练任务，显著提升了运动编码器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病客观步态评估受限于缺乏大规模、多样化且临床标注的运动数据集，现有数据集规模小且缺乏多中心数据。

Method: 收集来自8个临床中心9个队列的数据，通过统一预处理流程将RGB视频或运动捕捉数据转换为匿名SMPL网格，支持监督临床评分预测和无监督运动预训练两个基准任务。

Result: 运动编码器始终优于手工特征，在CARE-PD上预训练将MPJPE从60.8mm降至7.5mm，并将PD严重程度macro-F1提高17个百分点。

Conclusion: CARE-PD证明了临床策划的多样化训练数据的价值，为帕金森病步态分析提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Objective gait assessment in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is limited by the
absence of large, diverse, and clinically annotated motion datasets. We
introduce CARE-PD, the largest publicly available archive of 3D mesh gait data
for PD, and the first multi-site collection spanning 9 cohorts from 8 clinical
centers. All recordings (RGB video or motion capture) are converted into
anonymized SMPL meshes via a harmonized preprocessing pipeline. CARE-PD
supports two key benchmarks: supervised clinical score prediction (estimating
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS, gait scores) and unsupervised
motion pretext tasks (2D-to-3D keypoint lifting and full-body 3D
reconstruction). Clinical prediction is evaluated under four generalization
protocols: within-dataset, cross-dataset, leave-one-dataset-out, and
multi-dataset in-domain adaptation. To assess clinical relevance, we compare
state-of-the-art motion encoders with a traditional gait-feature baseline,
finding that encoders consistently outperform handcrafted features. Pretraining
on CARE-PD reduces MPJPE (from 60.8mm to 7.5mm) and boosts PD severity macro-F1
by 17 percentage points, underscoring the value of clinically curated, diverse
training data. CARE-PD and all benchmark code are released for non-commercial
research at https://neurips2025.care-pd.ca/.

*Jiarui Ouyang,Yihui Wang,Yihang Gao,Yingxue Xu,Shu Yang,Hao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenAR是一个多尺度自回归框架，通过从粗到细的方式预测空间转录组数据，将基因聚类为层次组来建模基因间依赖关系，直接预测原始计数而非连续值，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组技术成本高昂，而H&E染色图像广泛可用。现有计算方法存在两个问题：(i) 独立预测每个基因，忽略了共表达结构；(ii) 将离散计数任务建模为连续回归，导致生物学上不可信的输出。

Method: GenAR采用多尺度自回归框架，将基因聚类为层次组以捕获跨基因依赖关系，将表达建模为无码书的离散标记生成来直接预测原始计数，并在解码时融合组织学和空间嵌入。

Result: 在四个不同组织类型的空间转录组数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，GenAR达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GenAR通过离散建模和从粗到细的分解，避免了log诱导的偏差，为精准医学和成本效益高的分子分析提供了潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) offers spatially resolved gene expression but
remains costly. Predicting expression directly from widely available
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images presents a cost-effective
alternative. However, most computational approaches (i) predict each gene
independently, overlooking co-expression structure, and (ii) cast the task as
continuous regression despite expression being discrete counts. This mismatch
can yield biologically implausible outputs and complicate downstream analyses.
We introduce GenAR, a multi-scale autoregressive framework that refines
predictions from coarse to fine. GenAR clusters genes into hierarchical groups
to expose cross-gene dependencies, models expression as codebook-free discrete
token generation to directly predict raw counts, and conditions decoding on
fused histological and spatial embeddings. From an information-theoretic
perspective, the discrete formulation avoids log-induced biases and the
coarse-to-fine factorization aligns with a principled conditional
decomposition. Extensive experimental results on four Spatial Transcriptomics
datasets across different tissue types demonstrate that GenAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, offering potential implications for precision
medicine and cost-effective molecular profiling. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Diffusion^2框架，通过两个连接的扩散模型解决瞬时轨迹预测问题：一个用于生成未观测的历史轨迹，另一个用于预测未来轨迹，并设计了不确定性估计和动态噪声调节机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶和人机交互中，当行人从盲区突然出现时，往往缺乏足够的观测数据（瞬时轨迹），这使得准确预测变得困难并增加交通事故风险。

Method: Diffusion^2框架包含两个序列连接的扩散模型：反向预测模型生成未观测的历史轨迹，前向预测模型预测未来轨迹。采用双头参数化机制估计不确定性，并设计时间自适应噪声模块动态调节前向扩散过程的噪声尺度。

Result: 在ETH/UCY和Stanford Drone数据集上，Diffusion^2在瞬时轨迹预测方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的Diffusion^2框架有效解决了瞬时轨迹预测问题，通过生成历史轨迹和动态噪声调节机制显著提升了预测准确性，对提升交通安全具有重要意义。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier
studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future
trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly
emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable
(i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and
increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on
pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for
enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed
Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists
of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction,
which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward
prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated
unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a
dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty
and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the
noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a
new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford
Drone datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频模型局限于2D视图且交互能力有限，需要能够支持可控和可编辑时空环境的世界模型，为机器人技术提供可扩展的训练数据、可复现的评估和灵活的任务设计。

Method: 整合轨迹引导生成与特征场蒸馏，通过语言指令生成4D场景，支持多视角一致性和对象级控制，允许交互式编辑而无需完全重新生成。

Result: 实验表明MorphoSim在保持高场景保真度的同时实现了可控性和可编辑性。

Conclusion: MorphoSim框架成功实现了语言引导的4D场景生成，为机器人应用提供了更灵活和可控的动态环境生成能力。

Abstract: World models that support controllable
  and editable spatiotemporal environments are valuable
  for robotics, enabling scalable training data, repro ducible evaluation, and
flexible task design. While
  recent text-to-video models generate realistic dynam ics, they are
constrained to 2D views and offer limited
  interaction. We introduce MorphoSim, a language guided framework that
generates 4D scenes with
  multi-view consistency and object-level controls. From
  natural language instructions, MorphoSim produces
  dynamic environments where objects can be directed,
  recolored, or removed, and scenes can be observed
  from arbitrary viewpoints. The framework integrates
  trajectory-guided generation with feature field dis tillation, allowing edits
to be applied interactively
  without full re-generation. Experiments show that Mor phoSim maintains high
scene fidelity while enabling
  controllability and editability. The code is available

*Xuyang Guo,Zekai Huang,Zhenmei Shi,Zhao Song,Jiahao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VLMCountBench基准测试，发现当前视觉语言模型在单一形状计数时表现可靠，但在组合形状计数时存在显著失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉语言模型是否能够正确计数物体，特别是测试其在组合计数任务中的能力。

Method: 创建了包含基本几何形状及其组合的简约基准测试VLMCountBench，通过严格控制变量研究颜色、大小和提示词优化等因素的影响。

Result: VLMs在单一形状类型存在时计数可靠，但在多个形状类型组合时表现大幅下降，显示出组合计数能力的根本局限性。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在组合计数方面存在根本性经验限制，这为未来研究指明了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI
community, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on
large-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated
strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video
understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these
noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects
correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark,
VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric
shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively
on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict
independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple
properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation.
Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one
shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape
types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a
fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important
directions for future research.

*Venkata Bharath Reddy Reddem,Akshay P Sarashetti,Ranjith Merugu,Amit Satish Unde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CodeFormer++是一个新颖的盲人脸恢复框架，通过分解任务为身份保持恢复、高质量生成和动态融合，解决了现有方法在视觉质量和身份保真度之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲人脸恢复方法在集成生成先验时，往往面临视觉质量和身份保真度之间的权衡，导致身份失真或退化去除不理想。

Method: 将BFR分解为三个子任务：身份保持恢复、高质量生成和动态融合；提出基于学习的可变形人脸配准模块、纹理引导恢复网络，并集成深度度量学习。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据集上的广泛实验表明，CodeFormer++在视觉保真度和身份一致性方面均取得优越性能。

Conclusion: CodeFormer++框架成功最大化生成先验的效用，实现了高质量人脸恢复同时保持身份特征。

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) has attracted increasing attention with the rise
of generative methods. Most existing approaches integrate generative priors
into the restoration pro- cess, aiming to jointly address facial detail
generation and identity preservation. However, these methods often suffer from
a trade-off between visual quality and identity fidelity, leading to either
identity distortion or suboptimal degradation removal. In this paper, we
present CodeFormer++, a novel framework that maximizes the utility of
generative priors for high-quality face restoration while preserving identity.
We decompose BFR into three sub-tasks: (i) identity- preserving face
restoration, (ii) high-quality face generation, and (iii) dynamic fusion of
identity features with realistic texture details. Our method makes three key
contributions: (1) a learning-based deformable face registration module that
semantically aligns generated and restored faces; (2) a texture guided
restoration network to dynamically extract and transfer the texture of
generated face to boost the quality of identity-preserving restored face; and
(3) the integration of deep metric learning for BFR with the generation of
informative positive and hard negative samples to better fuse identity-
preserving and generative features. Extensive experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that, the pro- posed CodeFormer++ achieves
superior performance in terms of both visual fidelity and identity consistency.

*Yuanhao Zou,Shengji Jin,Andong Deng,Youpeng Zhao,Jun Wang,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出A.I.R.方法，通过自适应迭代推理选择关键帧，解决VideoQA中计算成本与准确性的平衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有帧选择方法面临两难：轻量级相似度模型无法捕捉复杂查询的语义细节，而使用VLM深度分析又计算成本过高

Method: 利用强大VLM对复杂查询进行深度语义分析，在低成本迭代循环中每次只处理一小批最有潜力的帧

Result: 在多个VideoQA基准测试中表现优于现有帧选择方法，显著提升基础VLM性能，计算效率大幅提升

Conclusion: A.I.R.方法在保证准确性的同时大幅降低计算成本，为VideoQA中的帧选择提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Effectively applying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Video Question
Answering (VideoQA) hinges on selecting a concise yet comprehensive set of
frames, as processing entire videos is computationally infeasible. However,
current frame selection methods face a critical trade-off: approaches relying
on lightweight similarity models, such as CLIP, often fail to capture the
nuances of complex queries, resulting in inaccurate similarity scores that
cannot reflect the authentic query-frame relevance, which further undermines
frame selection. Meanwhile, methods that leverage a VLM for deeper analysis
achieve higher accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs. To address
these limitations, we propose A.I.R., a training-free approach for Adaptive,
Iterative, and Reasoning-based frame selection. We leverage a powerful VLM to
perform deep, semantic analysis on complex queries, and this analysis is
deployed within a cost-effective iterative loop that processes only a small
batch of the most high-potential frames at a time. Extensive experiments on
various VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
frame selection methods, significantly boosts the performance of the foundation
VLM, and achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency over other
VLM-based techniques.

*Qiyuan He,Yicong Li,Haotian Ye,Jinghao Wang,Xinyao Liao,Pheng-Ann Heng,Stefano Ermon,James Zou,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出reAR训练策略，通过token-wise正则化解决自回归视觉生成中的生成器-分词器不一致问题，显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归生成性能落后于扩散模型，核心瓶颈是生成器与分词器的不一致性，即AR生成的token可能无法被分词器良好解码

Method: 引入token-wise正则化目标：在预测下一个token时，因果变换器同时学习恢复当前token的视觉嵌入，并在噪声上下文中预测目标token的嵌入

Result: 在ImageNet上，gFID从3.02降至1.86，IS提升至316.9；应用于先进分词器时，仅用177M参数达到gFID 1.42，匹配675M参数扩散模型性能

Conclusion: reAR是一种简单有效的训练策略，无需改变分词器、生成顺序或推理流程，就能显著提升视觉自回归生成性能

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (AR) generation offers a promising path toward unifying
vision and language models, yet its performance remains suboptimal against
diffusion models. Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations
and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from
the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated
tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose
reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization
objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also
trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the
embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to
the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models.
Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet,
it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard
rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves
a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger
state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).

TL;DR: SPEGNet提出了一种统一的伪装目标检测方法，通过通道校准和空间增强集成多尺度特征，避免了传统方法中复杂组件累积带来的计算负担和细节丢失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前伪装目标检测方法依赖累积复杂组件（如边界模块、注意力机制、多尺度处理器），导致计算负担增加但性能提升不成比例，且需降低分辨率处理而丢失精细细节。

Method: 采用统一架构设计，通过通道校准和空间增强集成多尺度特征，边界直接从上下文丰富的表示中产生，保持语义-空间对齐，并采用渐进细化实现尺度自适应边缘调制。

Result: 在CAMO数据集上达到0.887 Sα，COD10K上0.890，NC4K上0.895，具有实时推理速度，能有效处理从微小复杂物体到大型模式相似物体的各种尺度目标。

Conclusion: SPEGNet在边界精度和区域一致性之间取得了良好平衡，能够处理遮挡和模糊边界，在多个数据集上表现出色且计算效率高。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection segments objects with intrinsic similarity and
edge disruption. Current detection methods rely on accumulated complex
components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention
mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates
a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity,
they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for
camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified
design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel
calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from
context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment.
Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak
influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between
boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_\alpha$
on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed.
Our approach excels across scales, from tiny, intricate objects to large,
pattern-similar ones, while handling occlusion and ambiguous boundaries. Code,

Conclusion: MedCLM通过自动化生成带有思维链推理的医学VQA数据和集成课程策略，成功解决了医学影像中临床诊断推理与AI结合的核心挑战。

Abstract: Bridging clinical diagnostic reasoning with AI remains a central challenge in
medical imaging. We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts
detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA)
data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ
segmentation and structured rationales. These contextual signals enable medical
vision-language models to generate question-answer pairs with step-by-step
reasoning. To utilize this data effectively, we propose an Integrated
CoT-Curriculum Strategy composed of an Easy stage with explicit lesion boxes
for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and
a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate
that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA
benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned
medical vision-language models.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress in
multimodal understanding tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities particularly
in general tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. However, when
dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts,
existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain
knowledge limitations. Due to the lack of targeted training data, current VLMs
struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks.
To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as
the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery
analysis, collecting 664 ancient Greek vase 3D models with corresponding
question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We
further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact
analysis through domain-adaptive training. Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of our approach, where we improve by 12.8% on R@1 metrics and by
6.6% on lexical similarity compared with previous state-of-the-art on the
VaseVQA-3D dataset, significantly improving the recognition and understanding
of 3D vase artifacts, providing new technical pathways for digital heritage

Conclusion: TBStar-Edit通过专门针对电商领域的优化设计，成功解决了通用模型在电商场景中的一致性限制问题，实现了更好的编辑效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation and editing technologies have enabled
state-of-the-art models to achieve impressive results in general domains.
However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often
encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce
TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain.
Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training
strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while
maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for
data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline,
encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to
acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing
data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a
hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting
modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a
two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first
stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency
enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate
datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a
self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that
TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both
objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出异步扩散模型框架，通过为不同像素分配不同时间步，让提示相关区域比无关区域更渐进地去噪，从而利用更清晰的像素间上下文，显著提升文本到图像的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用同步去噪，所有像素同时从随机噪声演变为清晰图像，导致提示相关区域只能参考相同噪声水平的无关区域，无法获得清晰上下文，最终损害文本到图像对齐效果。

Method: 提出异步扩散模型框架，为不同像素分配不同的时间步，动态调节单个像素的时间步调度，使提示相关区域比无关区域更渐进地去噪。

Result: 大量实验表明，异步扩散模型能显著提高各种提示下的文本到图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: 异步扩散模型通过异步去噪机制，让提示相关区域能够利用更清晰的像素间上下文，从而在最终图像中实现更好的对齐效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating high-quality
images. Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with
the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all
pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result,
during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated
regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately
impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose
asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct
timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising
process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels,
prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions,
thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently,
these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can
significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts. The code
repository for this work is available at https://github.com/hu-zijing/AsynDM.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像生成中常出现语义不一致或幻觉问题，现有的推理时引导方法通常依赖外部信号或架构修改，会引入额外计算开销。

Method: TAG利用中间样本作为投影基，放大估计分数相对于该基的切向分量来修正采样轨迹，基于一阶泰勒展开形式化这一引导过程。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image

While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they
often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural
modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this
paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and
direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without
modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample
as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated
scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We
formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion,
which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state
toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and
enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module
that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition,
offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.

*Honglin Liu,Chao Sun,Peng Hu,Yunfan Li,Xi Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出条件表示学习(CRL)方法，通过用户指定的条件生成定制化特征表示，解决通用表示学习与下游任务不匹配的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示学习方法学习的是主要捕捉主导语义的通用表示，可能与定制化下游任务不匹配。例如在动物栖息地分析中，研究人员关注场景相关特征，而通用嵌入强调分类语义，导致次优结果

Method: CRL首先使用大语言模型根据用户指定条件生成描述性文本来构建语义基，然后利用视觉语言模型将图像表示投影到这个条件特征空间中

Result: 在分类和检索任务上的大量实验证明了CRL的优越性和通用性

Conclusion: 条件表示学习能够为任意用户指定标准提取定制化表示，更好地捕捉特定标准的语义，可用于多个定制化任务

Abstract: Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation
that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with
customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis,
researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings
emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution,
existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high
computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional
Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to
arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics
of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive
words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon
this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large
language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic
basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature
space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation
better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized
for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and
retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了AI Session Recorder系统，通过记录病理学家在数字切片查看器中的导航行为，创建Pathology-CoT数据集，并构建Pathologist-o3智能体系统，在胃肠道淋巴结转移检测中取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有病理学基础模型虽然强大，但缺乏实用的智能体系统来模拟病理学家的多阶段诊断过程（调整放大倍数、移动视野等），主要障碍是缺乏可扩展的、临床对齐的专家行为监督数据。

Method: 使用AI Session Recorder无干扰地记录常规导航，将查看器日志转换为标准化行为命令；通过轻量级人工审查将AI起草的理由转化为Pathology-CoT数据集；构建两阶段智能体Pathologist-o3，先提出感兴趣区域，再进行行为引导推理。

Result: 在胃肠道淋巴结转移检测中，Pathologist-o3达到84.5%精确率、100.0%召回率和75.4%准确率，超过最先进的OpenAI o3模型，并在不同骨干网络上具有良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架将日常查看器日志转化为可扩展的专家验证监督，使智能体病理学实用化，并为人类对齐、可升级的临床AI建立了路径。

Abstract: Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process
involving changes in magnification and movement between fields. Although recent
pathology foundation models are strong, practical agentic systems that decide
what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable
diagnoses are still lacking. The blocker is data: scalable, clinically aligned
supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not
written in textbooks or online, and therefore absent from large language model
training. We introduce the AI Session Recorder, which works with standard WSI
viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs
into standardized behavioral commands (inspect or peek at discrete
magnifications) and bounding boxes. A lightweight human-in-the-loop review
turns AI-drafted rationales into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired
"where to look" and "why it matters" supervision produced at roughly six times
lower labeling time. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathologist-o3, a
two-stage agent that first proposes regions of interest and then performs
behavior-guided reasoning. On gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection,
it achieved 84.5% precision, 100.0% recall, and 75.4% accuracy, exceeding the
state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our
knowledge, this constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems
in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated
supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a
path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.

Motivation: 现有特征融合技术在处理异构冗余多模态图像时，难以有效提取结构特征和细节特征。本文旨在引入频域学习来建模关键和稀疏细节特征。

Method: 提出空间-光谱-频率交互网络(S²Fin)，包含高频稀疏增强Transformer、两级空间-频率融合策略（自适应频率通道模块和高频共振掩码）以及空间-光谱注意力融合模块。

Result: 在四个基准多模态数据集上的实验表明，S²Fin在有限标注数据下实现了优越的分类性能，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: S²Fin通过多域融合有效提升了多模态遥感图像分类性能，证明了频域学习在特征提取中的有效性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant success in remote
sensing Earth observation data analysis. Numerous feature fusion techniques
address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global
and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract
structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal
images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and
sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency
interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across
the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a
high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse
spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency
filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is
introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses
low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a
high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity.
In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances
feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four
benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that
S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at https://github.com/HaoLiu-XDU/SSFin.

Result: 在包含八个深度伪造数据集的DFWild-Cup数据集上实现了最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: 混合模型能有效应对深度伪造检测的挑战，为实际应用提供鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting manipulated media has now become a pressing issue with the recent
rise of deepfakes. Most existing approaches fail to generalize across diverse
datasets and generation techniques. We thus propose a novel ensemble framework,
combining the strengths of transformer-based architectures, such as Swin
Transformers and ViTs, and texture-based methods, to achieve better detection
accuracy and robustness. Our method introduces innovative data-splitting,
sequential training, frequency splitting, patch-based attention, and face
segmentation techniques to handle dataset imbalances, enhance high-impact
regions (e.g., eyes and mouth), and improve generalization. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance when tested on the DFWild-Cup dataset, a diverse
subset of eight deepfake datasets. The ensemble benefits from the
complementarity of these approaches, with transformers excelling in global
feature extraction and texturebased methods providing interpretability. This
work demonstrates that hybrid models can effectively address the evolving
challenges of deepfake detection, offering a robust solution for real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了四种最佳分割方法与SLIC在森林砍伐检测任务中的表现，发现通过分类器融合方法可以显著提升准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ForestEyes项目结合公民科学和机器学习检测热带森林砍伐，传统使用SLIC算法，但研究表明其他超像素方法在遥感图像分割中表现更好，需要评估这些方法对分类器训练的影响。

Method: 使用四种最佳分割方法与SLIC进行对比，采用PyCaret AutoML库选择前五名分类器，并应用分类器融合方法。

Result: 初始结果显示分割方法间性能差异不大，但通过分类器融合方法后，平衡准确率有明显提升。

Conclusion: 分割方法的选择和机器学习模型的组合都对森林砍伐检测任务至关重要，分类器融合能显著改善性能。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a crucial step in various visual applications,
including environmental monitoring through remote sensing. In the context of
the ForestEyes project, which combines citizen science and machine learning to
detect deforestation in tropical forests, image segments are used for labeling
by volunteers and subsequent model training. Traditionally, the Simple Linear
Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm is adopted as the segmentation method.
However, recent studies have indicated that other superpixel-based methods
outperform SLIC in remote sensing image segmentation, and might suggest that
they are more suitable for the task of detecting deforested areas. In this
sense, this study investigated the impact of the four best segmentation
methods, together with SLIC, on the training of classifiers for the target
application. Initially, the results showed little variation in performance
among segmentation methods, even when selecting the top five classifiers using
the PyCaret AutoML library. However, by applying a classifier fusion approach
(ensemble of classifiers), noticeable improvements in balanced accuracy were
observed, highlighting the importance of both the choice of segmentation method
and the combination of machine learning-based models for deforestation
detection tasks.

TL;DR: EduPersona是一个针对教育领域的大规模基准测试，专注于评估虚拟学生代理的主观能力，包含多语言、多学科和多种人格类型的数据集和评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育中的集成日益增多，虚拟学生代理在课堂模拟和教师培训中变得至关重要。然而，这些代理的课堂导向主观能力尚未得到充分评估，限制了模型边界的理解和可信部署。

Method: 构建了EduPersona基准测试，包含两个语言、三个学科和十种基于大五人格理论的人格类型。数据集包含1,308个真实课堂对话轮次，对应12,814个师生问答轮次，并通过人格风格化扩展到约128k轮次。将主观性能分解为三个渐进任务：基本连贯性、学生真实性和长期人格一致性。

Result: 在三个代表性LLM上的系统实验显示，经过EduPersona人格微调的变体在所有任务上都取得了显著改进：TASK1 +33.6%、TASK2 +30.6%、TASK3 +14.9%。

Conclusion: EduPersona提供了首个以主观能力为中心的课堂基准测试，建立了可分离和可验证的研究范式，并将开源数据集和框架以支持教育领域可信和类人AI的发展。

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly integrated into education, virtual
student agents are becoming vital for classroom simulation and teacher
training. Yet their classroom-oriented subjective abilities remain largely
unassessed, limiting understanding of model boundaries and hindering
trustworthy deployment. We present EduPersona, a large-scale benchmark spanning
two languages, three subjects, and ten persona types based on the Big Five
theory. The dataset contains 1,308 authentic classroom dialogue rounds,
corresponding to 12,814 teacher-student Q&A turns, and is further expanded
through persona stylization into roughly 10 times larger scale (128k turns),
providing a solid foundation for evaluation. Building on this resource, we
decompose hard-to-quantify subjective performance into three progressive tasks:
TASK1 basic coherence (whether behavior, emotion, expression, and voice align
with classroom context), TASK2 student realism, and TASK3 long-term persona
consistency, thereby establishing an evaluation framework grounded in
educational theory and research value. We conduct systematic experiments on
three representative LLMs, comparing their original versions with ten
persona-fine-tuned variants trained on EduPersona. Results show consistent and
significant average improvements across all tasks: TASK1 +33.6%, TASK2 +30.6%,
and TASK3 +14.9%. These improvements highlight the dataset's effectiveness and
research value, while also revealing the heterogeneous difficulty of persona
modeling. In summary, EduPersona delivers the first classroom benchmark
centered on subjective abilities, establishes a decoupled and verifiable
research paradigm, and we will open-source both the dataset and the framework
to support the broader research community in advancing trustworthy and
human-like AI for education.

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层多阶段运动专家混合模型（MoME），用于从步态序列中预测心理特征，在PsyMo基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态包含丰富的生物特征和行为信息，但利用行走方式推断心理特征仍是一个具有挑战性且未被充分探索的问题。

Method: 采用分层多阶段运动专家混合架构，将行走周期分为四个运动复杂度阶段，使用轻量级专家模型提取时空特征，并通过任务特定门控模块自适应加权专家。

Result: 在涵盖17个心理特征的PsyMo基准测试中，该方法在运行级别获得37.47%加权F1分数，在受试者级别获得44.6%加权F1分数，优于现有步态分析模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明多任务步态学习在心理特征估计方面具有可行性，为基于运动信息的心理推断提供了基础。

Abstract: Gait encodes rich biometric and behavioural information, yet leveraging the
manner of walking to infer psychological traits remains a challenging and
underexplored problem. We introduce a hierarchical Multi-Stage Mixture of
Movement Experts (MoME) architecture for multi-task prediction of psychological
attributes from gait sequences represented as 2D poses. MoME processes the
walking cycle in four stages of movement complexity, employing lightweight
expert models to extract spatio-temporal features and task-specific gating
modules to adaptively weight experts across traits and stages. Evaluated on the
PsyMo benchmark covering 17 psychological traits, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art gait analysis models, achieving a 37.47% weighted F1 score at
the run level and 44.6% at the subject level. Our experiments show that
integrating auxiliary tasks such as identity recognition, gender prediction,
and BMI estimation further improves psychological trait estimation. Our
findings demonstrate the viability of multi-task gait-based learning for
psychological trait estimation and provide a foundation for future research on
movement-informed psychological inference.

Motivation: 多概念个性化在文本到图像扩散模型中面临概念混合的挑战，即多个学习的概念在输出图像中产生不希望的干扰或混合。

Method: 提出ConceptSplit框架，包含两个关键组件：1）Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA) - 仅调整交叉注意力中的值投影的训练方法；2）Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA) - 在推理时通过优化输入潜变量来缓解注意力纠缠。

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量实验证明，ConceptSplit能够实现鲁棒的多概念个性化，减轻了意外的概念干扰。

Conclusion: ConceptSplit通过分离注意力机制有效解决了多概念个性化中的概念混合问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-concept personalization for text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models to represent several subjects in an image has gained much more
attention. The main challenge of this task is "concept mixing", where multiple
learned concepts interfere or blend undesirably in the output image. To address
this issue, in this paper, we present ConceptSplit, a novel framework to split
the individual concepts through training and inference. Our framework comprises
two key components. First, we introduce Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA), a
merging-free training method that focuses exclusively on adapting the value
projection in cross-attention. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that
modifying the key projection, a common approach in existing methods, can
disrupt the attention mechanism and lead to concept mixing. Second, we propose
Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA), which alleviates
attention entanglement during inference by optimizing the input latent. Through
extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that
ConceptSplit achieves robust multi-concept personalization, mitigating
unintended concept interference. Code is available at

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation in multi-phase MRI is vital for liver fibrosis
assessment, yet labeled data is often scarce and unevenly distributed across
imaging modalities and vendor systems. We propose a label-efficient
segmentation approach that promotes cross-modality generalization under
real-world conditions, where GED4 hepatobiliary-phase annotations are limited,
non-contrast sequences (T1WI, T2WI, DWI) are unlabeled, and spatial
misalignment and missing phases are common. Our method integrates a
foundation-scale 3D segmentation backbone adapted via fine-tuning, co-training
with cross pseudo supervision to leverage unlabeled volumes, and a standardized
preprocessing pipeline. Without requiring spatial registration, the model
learns to generalize across MRI phases and vendors, demonstrating robust
segmentation performance in both labeled and unlabeled domains. Our results
exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed label-efficient baseline for liver
segmentation in multi-phase, multi-vendor MRI and highlight the potential of
combining foundation model adaptation with co-training for real-world clinical
imaging tasks.

Abstract: Human-centric generative models designed for AI-driven storytelling must
bring together two core capabilities: identity consistency and precise control
over human performance. While recent diffusion-based approaches have made
significant progress in maintaining facial identity, achieving fine-grained
expression control without compromising identity remains challenging. In this
work, we present a diffusion-based framework that faithfully reimagines any
subject under any particular facial expression. Building on an ID-consistent
face foundation model, we adopt a compositional design featuring an expression
cross-attention module guided by FLAME blendshape parameters for explicit
control. Trained on a diverse mixture of image and video data rich in
expressive variation, our adapter generalizes beyond basic emotions to subtle
micro-expressions and expressive transitions, overlooked by prior works. In
addition, a pluggable Reference Adapter enables expression editing in real
images by transferring the appearance from a reference frame during synthesis.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model
outperforms existing methods in tailored and identity-consistent expression
generation. Code and models can be found at

Conclusion: 对象特征质量是决定场景图准确性的关键因素，通过改进对象表示学习和有效整合关系信息，可以显著提升3D语义场景图预测性能

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Graph Prediction aims to detect objects and their semantic
relationships in 3D scenes, and has emerged as a crucial technology for
robotics and AR/VR applications. While previous research has addressed dataset
limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings,
they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and
relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks
despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate
through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical
role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we
design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive
pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the
scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification
accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction.
Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we
observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics.
Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the
integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric
and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction.
Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/OCRL-3DSSG-Codes.

Motivation: 解决野生动物监测中从单目图像获取准确距离测量的挑战，系统评估MDE方法在自然环境中的性能。

Method: 使用93张带有校准ChARUCO图案地面真实距离的相机陷阱图像，评估4种SOTA MDE方法（Depth Anything V2、ML Depth Pro、ZoeDepth、Metric3D）和几何基线方法。

Result: Depth Anything V2表现最佳（MAE: 0.454m，相关性0.962），ZoeDepth在户外自然环境中性能显著下降（MAE: 3.087m），中值深度提取在所有深度学习方法中均优于均值方法。

Conclusion: 建立了野生动物应用中的性能基准，为保护监测系统中实施深度估计提供实用指导，Depth Anything V2在准确性和速度之间达到最佳平衡。

Abstract: Camera traps are widely used for wildlife monitoring, but extracting accurate
distance measurements from monocular images remains challenging due to the lack
of depth information. While monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods have
advanced significantly, their performance in natural wildlife environments has
not been systematically evaluated. This work introduces the first benchmark for
monocular metric depth estimation in wildlife monitoring conditions. We
evaluate four state-of-the-art MDE methods (Depth Anything V2, ML Depth Pro,
ZoeDepth, and Metric3D) alongside a geometric baseline on 93 camera trap images
with ground truth distances obtained using calibrated ChARUCO patterns. Our
results demonstrate that Depth Anything V2 achieves the best overall
performance with a mean absolute error of 0.454m and correlation of 0.962,
while methods like ZoeDepth show significant degradation in outdoor natural
environments (MAE: 3.087m). We find that median-based depth extraction
consistently outperforms mean-based approaches across all deep learning
methods. Additionally, we analyze computational efficiency, with ZoeDepth being
fastest (0.17s per image) but least accurate, while Depth Anything V2 provides
an optimal balance of accuracy and speed (0.22s per image). This benchmark
establishes performance baselines for wildlife applications and provides
practical guidance for implementing depth estimation in conservation monitoring
systems.

Abstract: Quantifying sponsor visibility in sports broadcasts is a critical marketing
task traditionally hindered by manual, subjective, and unscalable analysis
methods. While automated systems offer an alternative, their reliance on
axis-aligned Horizontal Bounding Box (HBB) leads to inaccurate exposuremetrics
when logos appear rotated or skewed due to dynamic camera angles and
perspective distortions. This paper introduces ExposureEngine, an end-to-end
system designed for accurate, rotation-aware sponsor visibility analytics in
sports broadcasts, demonstrated in a soccer case study. Our approach predicts
Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) to provide a geometrically precise fit to each logo
regardless of the orientation on-screen. To train and evaluate our detector, we
developed a new dataset comprising 1,103 frames from Swedish elite soccer,
featuring 670 unique sponsor logos annotated with OBBs. Our model achieves a
mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.859, with a precision of 0.96 and recall
of 0.87, demonstrating robust performance in localizing logos under diverse
broadcast conditions. The system integrates these detections into an analytical
pipeline that calculates precise visibility metrics, such as exposure duration
and on-screen coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate a language-driven agentic
layer, enabling users to generate reports, summaries, and media content through

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AA-YOLO，将统计异常检测集成到YOLO检测头中，有效控制红外小目标检测的误报率，在多种YOLO骨干网络中均表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测在防御应用中面临复杂背景和小目标尺寸的挑战，传统检测器会产生大量误报。

Method: 在YOLO检测头中集成统计异常检测测试，将小目标视为背景中的异常模式。

Result: 在多个IRSTD基准测试中取得竞争性性能，在训练数据有限、噪声和域偏移场景下表现出显著鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AA-YOLO具有高度通用性，可应用于各种YOLO骨干网络，包括轻量级模型，是资源受限实际部署的有吸引力的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) is a challenging task in defense
applications, where complex backgrounds and tiny target sizes often result in
numerous false alarms using conventional object detectors. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Anomaly-Aware YOLO (AA-YOLO), which integrates a
statistical anomaly detection test into its detection head. By treating small
targets as unexpected patterns against the background, AA-YOLO effectively
controls the false alarm rate. Our approach not only achieves competitive
performance on several IRSTD benchmarks, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness in scenarios with limited training data, noise, and domain shifts.
Furthermore, since only the detection head is modified, our design is highly
generic and has been successfully applied across various YOLO backbones,
including lightweight models. It also provides promising results when
integrated into an instance segmentation YOLO. This versatility makes AA-YOLO
an attractive solution for real-world deployments where resources are
constrained. The code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: Transformer架构在自然互动中的人员识别具有巨大潜力，姿态和动态信息具有互补性，为多模态和跨文化研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of transformer-based architectures
for person identification in natural, face-to-face conversation scenario. We
implement and evaluate a two-stream framework that separately models spatial
configurations and temporal motion patterns of 133 COCO WholeBody keypoints,
extracted from a subset of the CANDOR conversational corpus. Our experiments
compare pre-trained and from-scratch training, investigate the use of velocity
features, and introduce a multi-scale temporal transformer for hierarchical
motion modeling. Results demonstrate that domain-specific training
significantly outperforms transfer learning, and that spatial configurations
carry more discriminative information than temporal dynamics. The spatial
transformer achieves 95.74% accuracy, while the multi-scale temporal
transformer achieves 93.90%. Feature-level fusion pushes performance to 98.03%,
confirming that postural and dynamic information are complementary. These
findings highlight the potential of transformer architectures for person
identification in natural interactions and provide insights for future
multimodal and cross-cultural studies.

TL;DR: PG-Occ是一个渐进式高斯变换器框架，用于开放词汇的3D占用预测，通过渐进在线密集化和各向异性感知采样策略，在保持计算效率的同时提升对小物体的捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本对齐场景建模中的权衡问题：稀疏高斯表示难以捕捉小物体，而密集表示计算开销大。

Method: 采用渐进在线密集化策略逐步增强3D高斯表示，并结合各向异性感知采样与时空融合，自适应分配不同尺度和阶段的感受野。

Result: 在3D占用预测任务中实现了最先进的性能，相比之前最佳方法相对提升了14.3%的mIoU。

Conclusion: PG-Occ框架有效平衡了表示精度和计算效率，为开放词汇3D场景理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent
years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While
traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches
have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary
text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in
text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to
capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs
significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present
PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables
open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive
online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D
Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively
enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and
detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of
an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which
adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and
stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene
information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ
achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement
over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be
released upon publication on our project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的开放词汇学习方法，通过生成未见类数据来估计开放环境中的分布，从而提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用可见类数据估计开放环境分布，但由于未见类的缺失，估计误差无法识别。学习超越可见类对于边界估计误差至关重要。

Method: 包含类域级数据生成流程和分布对齐算法。数据生成流程在层次语义树和从可见类数据推断的域信息指导下生成未见类数据。分布对齐算法估计并最大化后验概率。

Result: 在11个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法比基线方法性能提升高达14%。

Conclusion: 通过生成未见类数据可以有效估计开放环境分布，理论证明估计误差有上界，实验验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary learning requires modeling the data distribution in open
environments, which consists of both seen-class and unseen-class data.
  Existing methods estimate the distribution in open environments using
seen-class data, where the absence of unseen classes makes the estimation error
inherently unidentifiable.
  Intuitively, learning beyond the seen classes is crucial for distribution
estimation to bound the estimation error.
  We theoretically demonstrate that the distribution can be effectively
estimated by generating unseen-class data, through which the estimation error
is upper-bounded.
  Building on this theoretical insight, we propose a novel open-vocabulary
learning method, which generates unseen-class data for estimating the
distribution in open environments. The method consists of a class-domain-wise
data generation pipeline and a distribution alignment algorithm. The data
generation pipeline generates unseen-class data under the guidance of a
hierarchical semantic tree and domain information inferred from the seen-class
data, facilitating accurate distribution estimation. With the generated data,
the distribution alignment algorithm estimates and maximizes the posterior
probability to enhance generalization in open-vocabulary learning. Extensive
experiments on $11$ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline
approaches by up to $14\%$, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

TL;DR: FedSurg挑战赛评估了联邦学习在手术视频分类中的表现，重点关注模型在未见临床中心的泛化能力和本地微调后的适应性。结果显示ViViT模型表现最佳，但泛化能力有限且排名稳定性低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立手术视频分类中联邦学习的基准，评估模型在保护患者数据隐私的同时，如何有效泛化到新临床中心并进行本地适应性调整。

Method: 参与者使用多中心Appendix300视频数据集开发策略，包括基础模型线性探测、度量学习、各种FL聚合方案（FedAvg、FedMedian、FedSAM），通过F1分数和期望成本评估性能。

Result: 泛化任务中跨中心性能有限；适应任务中所有团队在微调后都有改进，但排名稳定性低；ViViT模型表现最强；时空建模和上下文感知预处理是有效策略。

Conclusion: 该挑战赛建立了手术视频分类中联邦学习的首个基准，揭示了本地个性化与全局鲁棒性之间的权衡，强调了架构选择、预处理和损失设计的重要性。

Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art
in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess
how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt
through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development
without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to
classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the
multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:
generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after
fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear
probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes
(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and
Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and
statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across
centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after
fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission
achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted
limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties
in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal
modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.
Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for
evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight
the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and
underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss
design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of
imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

Method: 将扫描空间参数化为不同区域，实现扫描机器人和托盘处理机器人之间的协调运动规划。通过优化的轨迹规划和路径点分布确保全面表面覆盖，最小化遮挡，平衡重建精度和系统效率。

Result: 实验结果显示，与基线方法相比，该方法实现了显著更低的Chamfer Distance和更高的F-score，提供更优的几何精度、改进的数字化效率，并减少了对专家操作员的依赖。

Conclusion: 自动化双机器人扫描系统为文化遗产保护提供了一种高效、准确的解决方案，能够实现高质量的3D数字化，同时降低对专业操作人员的需求。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D scanning is essential for preserving cultural heritage
artefacts, supporting documentation, analysis, and long-term conservation.
However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and
manual intervention to maintain optimal scanning conditions and coverage. We
present an automated two-robot scanning system that eliminates the need for
handheld or semi-automatic workflows by combining coordinated robotic
manipulation with high-resolution 3D scanning. Our system parameterizes the
scanning space into distinct regions, enabling coordinated motion planning
between a scanner-equipped robot and a tray-handling robot. Optimized
trajectory planning and waypoint distribution ensure comprehensive surface
coverage, minimize occlusions, and balance reconstruction accuracy with system
efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly
lower Chamfer Distance and higher F-score compared to baseline methods,
offering superior geometric accuracy, improved digitization efficiency, and
reduced reliance on expert operators.

TL;DR: 比较视觉变换器(ViT)和大规模卷积神经网络(CNN)在几何估计任务中的表现，发现在大数据场景下ViT表现更优，而在小数据场景下CNN的归纳偏置使其性能与ViT相当。

Motivation: 研究预训练模型在几何估计任务中的效率，特别是在低数据量情况下，探索ViT和CNN作为骨干架构在不同数据规模下的表现差异。

Method: 系统比较ResNet、EfficientNet、CLIP-ResNet等CNN模型与CLIP-ViT变体和DINO等ViT模型，在2D刚性变换和基础矩阵估计任务中评估其性能，涵盖从少样本到大数据量的不同场景。

Result: 在大数据下游场景中，ViT在微调时表现优于CNN；在小数据场景中，CNN的归纳偏置和较小容量使其性能与ViT相当；ViT在跨域评估中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 需要根据数据规模仔细选择模型架构进行微调，未来研究应关注平衡局部和全局表征的混合架构。

Abstract: Vision-transformers (ViTs) and large-scale convolution-neural-networks (CNNs)
have reshaped computer vision through pretrained feature representations that
enable strong transfer learning for diverse tasks. However, their efficiency as
backbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image
deformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers
two such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images
and 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important
problem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D
scene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work
systematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet)
with ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data
size settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are
optimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus
mostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local
and global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of
these models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that,
similar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in
large downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the
inductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing
them to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in
cross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results
emphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for
refinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that
balance local and global representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿模型在细节保留、真实图像鲁棒性、采样效率和跨品类泛化方面存在不足，需要更强大的解决方案。

Method: 利用扩散变换器（DiT）进行图像条件虚拟试穿，探索多种配置方案，并在扩展数据集上训练以提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在VITON-HD数据集上超越最先进方法，实现更好的细节保留和鲁棒性，同时在数千个产品类别上表现出色。

Conclusion: DiT-VTON重新定义了虚拟试穿任务，提供了通用的虚拟试穿解决方案，支持多种产品类别和高级图像编辑功能。

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the demand for Virtual Try-On
(VTO) technologies, enabling customers to realistically visualize products
overlaid on their own images. Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face
challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world
imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization
across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel
VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its
performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the
image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT
configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel
concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO
image conditioning.
  To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing
varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories,
demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also
redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual
Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories
and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose
preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level
customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation
and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also
outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset
spanning thousands of product categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手术观察依赖固定视角或回忆，无法记录指导临床决策的第一人称视觉视角，限制了手术安全、培训和流程优化的洞察。

Method: 结合几何驱动神经渲染与基于扩散的视角增强技术，从壁挂固定摄像头视频合成任意时刻的任意第一人称视角。

Result: 在多站点手术案例和对照研究中，EgoSurg能够以高视觉质量和保真度重建人员特定的视觉场和任意视角。

Conclusion: EgoSurg将现有手术室摄像头基础设施转变为可导航的动态3D记录，为沉浸式手术数据科学奠定新基础，使手术实践可以从每个角度可视化、体验和分析。

Abstract: Observing surgical practice has historically relied on fixed vantage points
or recollections, leaving the egocentric visual perspectives that guide
clinical decisions undocumented. Fixed-camera video can capture surgical
workflows at the room-scale, but cannot reconstruct what each team member
actually saw. Thus, these videos only provide limited insights into how
decisions that affect surgical safety, training, and workflow optimization are
made. Here we introduce EgoSurg, the first framework to reconstruct the
dynamic, egocentric replays for any operating room (OR) staff directly from
wall-mounted fixed-camera video, and thus, without intervention to clinical
workflow. EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based
view enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and
egocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical
cases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual
fields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity. By
transforming existing OR camera infrastructure into a navigable dynamic 3D
record, EgoSurg establishes a new foundation for immersive surgical data
science, enabling surgical practice to be visualized, experienced, and analyzed
from every angle.

Motivation: 理解为什么多模态语言模型在感知密集型任务上表现不佳，特别是研究视觉键值令牌在模型中的处理机制。

Method: 分析流行MLMs(LLaVA-OneVision、Qwen2.5-VL、Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT)中视觉键值令牌的信息流动，通过零样本测试评估分割、语义对应、时间对应和指代表达检测等任务。

Result: 发现视觉值令牌编码了足够的感知信息，但语言模型未能有效利用；图像键令牌在后期层包含降低感知能力的伪影；添加文本前缀可以改善视觉表示；33.3%的BLINK基准问题中，语言模型内的感知信息未输出。

Conclusion: 揭示了键值令牌在多模态系统中的关键作用，为MLMs的机制解释性提供了新见解，并提出了改进视觉编码器和语言模型组件训练的新方向。

Abstract: Despite interpretability work analyzing VIT encoders and transformer
activations, we don't yet understand why Multimodal Language Models (MLMs)
struggle on perception-heavy tasks. We offer an under-studied perspective by
examining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and
Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the
flow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value
tokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks
zero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and
referring expression detection. We find that while the language model does
augment the visual information received from the projection of input visual
encodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it
contains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual
encoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that
the visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in
later layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception
capability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information
in the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input
improves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal
that if language models were able to better control their visual information,
their perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style
questions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the
language model is not surfaced to the output! Our findings reveal insights into
the role of key-value tokens in multimodal systems, paving the way for deeper
mechanistic interpretability of MLMs and suggesting new directions for training
their visual encoder and language model components.

Abstract: We propose AvatarVTON, the first 4D virtual try-on framework that generates
realistic try-on results from a single in-shop garment image, enabling free
pose control, novel-view rendering, and diverse garment choices. Unlike
existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under
single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or
physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal
Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes
avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer,
which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific
components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a
benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified
modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive
experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic
garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human
applications.

Abstract: Generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI or CBCT plays a crucial role in
enabling MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy, improving treatment
precision while reducing patient radiation exposure. To address this task, we
adopt a fully 3D Flow Matching (FM) framework, motivated by recent work
demonstrating FM's efficiency in producing high-quality images. In our
approach, a Gaussian noise volume is transformed into an sCT image by
integrating a learned FM velocity field, conditioned on features extracted from
the input MRI or CBCT using a lightweight 3D encoder. We evaluated the method
on the SynthRAD2025 Challenge benchmark, training separate models for MRI
$\rightarrow$ sCT and CBCT $\rightarrow$ sCT across three anatomical regions:
abdomen, head and neck, and thorax. Validation and testing were performed
through the challenge submission system. The results indicate that the method
accurately reconstructs global anatomical structures; however, preservation of
fine details was limited, primarily due to the relatively low training
resolution imposed by memory and runtime constraints. Future work will explore
patch-based training and latent-space flow models to improve resolution and
local structural fidelity.

TL;DR: 提出了AT-BPTT框架，通过动态调整截断位置和窗口大小来改进数据集蒸馏中的内循环优化，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法使用随机截断策略缺乏灵活性且效果不佳，因为神经网络在不同训练阶段具有不同的学习动态。

Method: AT-BPTT框架包含三个关键组件：基于概率的阶段感知时间步选择、基于梯度变化的自适应窗口大小调整、以及低秩Hessian近似来降低计算开销。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet和ImageNet-1K上的实验显示，AT-BPTT比基线方法平均准确率提高6.16%，内循环优化加速3.9倍，节省63%内存成本。

Conclusion: AT-BPTT通过动态适应梯度行为，显著提升了数据集蒸馏的性能和效率，为高效深度学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient deep learning has positioned dataset
distillation as a pivotal technique for compressing training dataset while
preserving model performance. However, existing inner-loop optimization methods
for dataset distillation typically rely on random truncation strategies, which
lack flexibility and often yield suboptimal results. In this work, we observe
that neural networks exhibit distinct learning dynamics across different
training stages-early, middle, and late-making random truncation ineffective.
To address this limitation, we propose Automatic Truncated Backpropagation
Through Time (AT-BPTT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts both
truncation positions and window sizes according to intrinsic gradient behavior.
AT-BPTT introduces three key components: (1) a probabilistic mechanism for
stage-aware timestep selection, (2) an adaptive window sizing strategy based on
gradient variation, and (3) a low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that AT-BPTT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving accuracy by an average of 6.16% over baseline methods.
Moreover, our approach accelerates inner-loop optimization by 3.9x while saving

Abstract: An accurate and up-to-date model of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant is
essential for its optimal operation and maintenance. However, such a model may
not be easily available. This work introduces a novel approach for PV power
plant mapping based on aerial overview images. It enables the automation of the
mapping process while removing the reliance on third-party data. The presented
mapping method takes advantage of the structural layout of the power plants to
achieve detailed modeling down to the level of individual PV modules. The
approach relies on visual segmentation of PV modules in overview images and the
inference of structural information in each image, assigning modules to
individual benches, rows, and columns. We identify visual keypoints related to
the layout and use these to merge detections from multiple images while
maintaining their structural integrity. The presented method was experimentally
verified and evaluated on two different power plants. The final fusion of 3D
positions and semantic structures results in a compact georeferenced model
suitable for power plant maintenance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖理论模型或问卷，存在范围有限、静态且劳动密集的问题，需要一种既能保护隐私又能捕捉人类心理状态的通用方法。

Method: 结合空间-时间图卷积网络(ST-GCN)和卷积神经网络(CNN)，利用迁移学习避免手动定义物理动作与心理类别之间的映射关系。

Result: 在DUET数据集上的结果表明，该方法能够实现可扩展、准确且以人为本的行为建模。

Conclusion: 该方法为增强强化学习驱动的人类-环境交互模拟提供了新途径，同时保护用户匿名性。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic relationship between humans and the built
environment is a key challenge in disciplines ranging from environmental
psychology to reinforcement learning (RL). A central obstacle in modeling these
interactions is the inability to capture human psychological states in a way
that is both generalizable and privacy preserving. Traditional methods rely on
theoretical models or questionnaires, which are limited in scope, static, and
labor intensive. We present a kinesics recognition framework that infers the
communicative functions of human activity -- known as kinesics -- directly from
3D skeleton joint data. Combining a spatial-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the framework
leverages transfer learning to bypass the need for manually defined mappings
between physical actions and psychological categories. The approach preserves
user anonymity while uncovering latent structures in bodily movements that
reflect cognitive and emotional states. Our results on the Dyadic User
EngagemenT (DUET) dataset demonstrate that this method enables scalable,
accurate, and human-centered modeling of behavior, offering a new pathway for
enhancing RL-driven simulations of human-environment interaction.

Motivation: 传统网络物理系统主要关注经济目标如性能和安全，但忽视了人类中心的社会效益。网络物理社会基础设施系统旨在通过将CPS与社会目标对齐来解决这一问题，需要理解人类互动及其社会意义。

Method: 使用深度传感器获取骨骼运动数据，比较五种基于骨骼的交互识别算法，在一个包含12种二元互动（如手势符号和情感表达）的数据集上进行评估。

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate sensing, computing, and control to
improve infrastructure performance, focusing on economic goals like performance
and safety. However, they often neglect potential human-centered (or
''social'') benefits. Cyber-physical-social infrastructure systems (CPSIS) aim
to address this by aligning CPS with social objectives. This involves defining
social benefits, understanding human interactions with each other and
infrastructure, developing privacy-preserving measurement methods, modeling
these interactions for prediction, linking them to social benefits, and
actuating the physical environment to foster positive social outcomes. This
paper delves into recognizing dyadic human interactions using real-world data,
which is the backbone to measuring social behavior. This lays a foundation to
address the need to enhance understanding of the deeper meanings and mutual
responses inherent in human interactions. While RGB cameras are informative for
interaction recognition, privacy concerns arise. Depth sensors offer a
privacy-conscious alternative by analyzing skeletal movements. This study
compares five skeleton-based interaction recognition algorithms on a dataset of
12 dyadic interactions. Unlike single-person datasets, these interactions,
categorized into communication types like emblems and affect displays, offer
insights into the cultural and emotional aspects of human interactions.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合早期退出和知识蒸馏的方法，通过引入基于熵的损失函数来优化学生早期退出模型的训练，在保持分类性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络虽然性能优异但计算成本高，不适用于实时和边缘应用。需要动态压缩技术来在运行时调节压缩级别，以适应资源受限的应用场景。

Method: 整合早期退出和知识蒸馏两种技术，使用更复杂的教师早期退出模型训练简化的学生早期退出模型。创新性地在教师分类错误的图像上引入基于熵的损失函数。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100和SVHN数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法能显著降低计算复杂度而不影响分类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了准确性和效率之间的权衡，为知识蒸馏在其他场景中的应用开辟了新的研究视角。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification with
relatively high efficiency, they still exhibit high computational costs, often
rendering them impractical for real-time and edge applications. Therefore, a
multitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs
while maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been
introduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a
desirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed
method effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques:
early exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit
model is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary
contribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student
early-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation
loss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the
teacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving significant
reductions in computational complexity without compromising classification
performance. The validity of this approach is substantiated by experimental
results on image classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN, which
further opens new research perspectives for Knowledge Distillation in other
contexts.

Conclusion: 深度学习模型因其在异常值存在时的稳定性能、评估小图像块的能力和快速预测，使光学显微镜研究能够受益于其泛化能力。

Abstract: Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research
studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable
experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples
and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct
processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with
variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward
implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when
evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for
well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal
domain.
  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based
IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability
and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by
previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for
IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same
architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores
for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable
predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside
the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA
provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize
spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that
optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep
learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers,
the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end, IoT-enabled robotic system for the
non-destructive, real-time, and spatially-resolved mapping of grape yield and
quality (Brix, Acidity) in vineyards. The system features a comprehensive
analytical pipeline that integrates two key modules: a high-performance model
for grape bunch detection and weight estimation, and a novel deep learning
framework for quality assessment from hyperspectral (HSI) data. A critical
barrier to in-field HSI is the ``domain shift" caused by variable illumination.
To overcome this, our quality assessment is powered by the Light-Invariant
Spectral Autoencoder (LISA), a domain-adversarial framework that learns
illumination-invariant features from uncalibrated data. We validated the
system's robustness on a purpose-built HSI dataset spanning three distinct
illumination domains: controlled artificial lighting (lab), and variable
natural sunlight captured in the morning and afternoon. Results show the
complete pipeline achieves a recall (0.82) for bunch detection and a $R^2$
(0.76) for weight prediction, while the LISA module improves quality prediction
generalization by over 20% compared to the baselines. By combining these robust
modules, the system successfully generates high-resolution, georeferenced data
of both grape yield and quality, providing actionable, data-driven insights for
precision viticulture.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems,
guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management.
Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a
thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS)
tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by
bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted
surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000}
of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable
supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data,
together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and
algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for
AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles,
facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying
open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance
accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a
standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements
in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

Conclusion: SAHC方法能够有效利用层次分类任务的固有结构，在遥感图像分类任务中展现出良好的适应性和性能提升。

Abstract: Deep learning has become increasingly important in remote sensing image
classification due to its ability to extract semantic information from complex
data. Classification tasks often include predefined label hierarchies that
represent the semantic relationships among classes. However, these hierarchies
are frequently overlooked, and most approaches focus only on fine-grained
classification schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Semantics-Aware
Hierarchical Consensus (SAHC) method for learning hierarchical features and
relationships by integrating hierarchy-specific classification heads within a
deep network architecture, each specialized in different degrees of class
granularity. The proposed approach employs trainable hierarchy matrices, which
guide the network through the learning of the hierarchical structure in a
self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical consensus
mechanism to ensure consistent probability distributions across different
hierarchical levels. This mechanism acts as a weighted ensemble being able to
effectively leverage the inherent structure of the hierarchical classification
task. The proposed SAHC method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with
different degrees of hierarchical complexity on different tasks, using distinct
backbone architectures to effectively emphasize its adaptability. Experimental
results show both the effectiveness of the proposed approach in guiding network
learning and the robustness of the hierarchical consensus for remote sensing
image classification tasks.

Result: 在ILD分类中，放射组学引导的集成平均AUC达0.8646±0.0467，比SwinUNETR基线提升12.5%；下叶模型AUC达0.88-0.90，优于DL对应模型。

Conclusion: REN展示了强大的泛化能力和临床可解释性，提供了一个可扩展的解剖学指导方法，可轻松扩展到其他结构化医学影像应用。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have significantly contributed to
scalable machine learning by enabling specialized subnetworks to tackle complex
tasks efficiently. However, traditional MoE systems lack domain-specific
constraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and
regional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here,
we introduce Regional Expert Networks (REN), the first anatomically-informed
MoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN
leverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated
to distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise
modeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating
mechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL)
features (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to
interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently
superior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of
0.8646 +/- 0.0467, a +12.5 percent improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC
0.7685, p = 0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe
models achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79)
and aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous
patient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and
clinical interpretability, presenting a scalable, anatomically-guided approach
readily extensible to other structured medical imaging applications.

Motivation: 传统主动学习需要大量人工标注，无监督主动学习虽能减少标注负担但性能不足，现有方法依赖局部梯度评分，对噪声敏感且无法充分覆盖数据分布。

Conclusion: NFPF通过革新样本重要性度量方式，为无监督主动学习提供了有效解决方案，在减少标注负担的同时保持高性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the
availability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is
notoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a
strategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative
data, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement.
Unsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the
annotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing
UAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches
typically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance
estimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data
but also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the
full data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear
selection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the
Natural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes
how sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature
Learning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to
model performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful
Reconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our
comprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all
established UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL
methods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative
visualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance,
enhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界诊断中具有实用价值，能够有效恢复缺失视图并提升诊断准确性。

Abstract: Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique
(MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast
cancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be
missing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression
artifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view
translation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike
natural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large
non-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which
obscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and
Implicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view
translation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address
cross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware
cross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that
anatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions
across views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise
correlations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents
into a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry. The
reconstructed 3D structure is refined and injected into the denoising UNet to
guide cross-view generation with enhanced anatomical awareness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CA3D-Diff achieves superior performance in
bidirectional tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity
and structural consistency. Furthermore, the synthesized views effectively
improve single-view malignancy classification in screening settings,
demonstrating the practical value of our method in real-world diagnostics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于KL-VAE的tokenizer需要对抗性损失，而扩散解码器虽然更理论化但需要迭代采样导致解码时间较长。为了解决这些限制，需要开发一种无需对抗性损失且采样效率更高的解码器。

Method: 提出新的像素扩散解码器架构，利用transformer组件和无GAN训练提高扩展性和训练稳定性。通过蒸馏技术将扩散解码器的性能复制到高效的单步解码器中。

Result: SSDD将重建FID从0.87提升到0.50，吞吐量提高1.4倍，在DiTs中保持生成质量的同时采样速度提高3.8倍。

Conclusion: SSDD可作为KL-VAE的直接替代品，用于构建更高质量和更快的生成模型。

Abstract: Tokenizers are a key component of state-of-the-art generative image models,
extracting the most important features from the signal while reducing data
dimension and redundancy. Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized
variational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and
adversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled
alternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent.
However, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses,
as well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these
limitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for
improved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components
and GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the
diffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder. This makes SSDD the
first diffusion decoder optimized for single-step reconstruction trained
without adversarial losses, reaching higher reconstruction quality and faster
sampling than KL-VAE. In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from
$0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation
quality of DiTs with $3.8\times$ faster sampling. As such, SSDD can be used as
a drop-in replacement for KL-VAE, and for building higher-quality and faster
generative models.

Motivation: 视觉基础模型的所有者需要保护知识产权，防止未经授权的模型再分发。当前缺乏可靠的模型所有权验证工具来区分受保护模型的再分发副本和独立模型。

Method: 微调视觉基础模型的少量表达层，结合小型编码器-解码器网络，在保留输入图像集的内部表示中嵌入数字水印。水印在模型被微调后仍保持可检测性。

Result: 理论分析和实验证明，该方法对非水印模型的误检概率低，对水印模型的漏检概率也低，能够有效验证模型所有权。

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉基础模型提供了可靠的所有权验证机制，即使模型经过下游任务微调后，嵌入的水印仍能保持可检测性，有效保护模型知识产权。

Abstract: Being trained on large and vast datasets, visual foundation models (VFMs) can
be fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks, achieving remarkable performance
and efficiency in various computer vision applications. The high computation
cost of data collection and training motivates the owners of some VFMs to
distribute them alongside the license to protect their intellectual property
rights. However, a dishonest user of the protected model's copy may illegally
redistribute it, for example, to make a profit. As a consequence, the
development of reliable ownership verification tools is of great importance
today, since such methods can be used to differentiate between a redistributed
copy of the protected model and an independent model. In this paper, we propose
an approach to ownership verification of visual foundation models by
fine-tuning a small set of expressive layers of a VFM along with a small
encoder-decoder network to embed digital watermarks into an internal
representation of a hold-out set of input images. Importantly, the watermarks
embedded remain detectable in the functional copies of the protected model,
obtained, for example, by fine-tuning the VFM for a particular downstream task.
Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed method
yields a low probability of false detection of a non-watermarked model and a
low probability of false misdetection of a watermarked model.

*Koen Vellenga,H. Joe Steinhauer,Jonas Andersson,Anders Sjögren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的潜在不确定性表示方法（LUR和RLUR），通过在预训练DNN中添加转换层来生成多个潜在表示以估计不确定性，在视频驾驶员行为识别任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在资源受限的安全关键任务中应用日益广泛，但现有最后一层概率深度学习方法在检测分布外实例时性能不稳定，需要更有效的不确定性估计方法。

Method: 扩展预训练DNN，添加转换层生成多个潜在表示来估计不确定性，提出了LUR和排斥训练的RLUR方法。

Result: 在四个视频驾驶员行为识别数据集上评估，LUR和RLUR在分布内分类性能与其他方法相当，在不确定性检测方面与最佳方法匹配，且训练更高效、调参更简单。

Conclusion: LUR方法在保持分类性能的同时，提供了更高效的不确定性估计，特别适合资源受限环境中的安全关键应用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks
in resource-constrained environments, such as video-based driver action and
intention recognition. While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL)
methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance
varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending
pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent
representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty
representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against
eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention
recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and
uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action
labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our
results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution
classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based
OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more
efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病早期诊断对预防不良影响至关重要，但传统诊断方法繁琐且昂贵，需要开发非侵入性、成本效益高的解决方案。

Conclusion: 机器学习在帕金森病早期诊断中具有巨大潜力，能够提供非侵入性且成本效益高的解决方案来改善患者预后。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition
characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons, leading to various movement
disorder symptoms. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to prevent adverse effects,
yet traditional diagnostic methods are often cumbersome and costly. In this
study, a machine learning-based approach is proposed using hand-drawn spiral
and wave images as potential biomarkers for PD detection. Our methodology
leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and
attention mechanisms to improve model performance and resilience against
overfitting. To enhance the diversity and richness of both spiral and wave
categories, the training dataset undergoes augmentation to increase the number
of images. The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing
pre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble
voting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating
predictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy
rates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are
90%, and for wave images, they are 96.67%. After combining the predictions
through ensemble hard voting, the overall accuracy is 93.3%. These findings
underscore the potential of machine learning in early PD diagnosis, offering a
non-invasive and cost-effective solution to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer
vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships,
long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of
Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders
with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that
transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated
reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.
This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training
methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars:
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL)
from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced
inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the
roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques,
addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal
grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through
systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design
principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open
challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We
further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate
rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM
capabilities. Additional resources and updates are maintained at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分割匹配比关键点匹配更能捕获结构化区域，对遮挡、光照变化和视角变化更具鲁棒性。传统方法在极端视角变化下表现不佳，需要利用3D基础模型的空间理解能力来解决宽基线分割匹配问题。

Method: 提出一种架构，利用3D基础模型的归纳偏置来匹配图像对中的分割区域，能够处理高达180度的视角变化。

Conclusion: 该方法在3D实例分割和图像目标导航等下游任务中展现出优势，证明了利用3D基础模型进行分割匹配的有效性。

Abstract: Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that
establishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent
regions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized
features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater
robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this
paper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle
wide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme
viewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of
these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180
degree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and
local feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++
and Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on
relevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance segmentation and image-goal
navigation. Project Page: https://segmast3r.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比度变化是影响图像质量的重要因素，但在现有图像质量评估方法中，对比度失真被严重忽视，其视觉影响和特性与其他传统失真类型不同。

Method: 使用一组对比度增强算法生成视觉上接近实际参考图像的伪参考图像，训练分类网络选择最适合的对比度增强算法，最后以全参考方式评估对比度增强图像与退化图像之间的质量差异。

Result: 在三个包含对比度失真的数据库（CCID2014、TID2013和CSIQ）上的性能评估表明，该方法具有有前景的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将无参考图像质量评估问题转化为全参考评估问题，通过伪参考图像生成提高了对比度失真图像质量评估的准确性。

Abstract: Contrast change is an important factor that affects the quality of images.
During image capturing, unfavorable lighting conditions can cause contrast
change and visual quality loss. While various methods have been proposed to
assess the quality of images under different distortions such as blur and
noise, contrast distortion has been largely overlooked as its visual impact and
properties are different from other conventional types of distortions. In this
paper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for
contrast-distorted images. Using a set of contrast enhancement algorithms, we
aim to generate pseudo-reference images that are visually close to the actual
reference image, such that the NR problem is transformed to a Full-reference
(FR) assessment with higher accuracy. To this end, a large dataset of
contrast-enhanced images is produced to train a classification network that can
select the most suitable contrast enhancement algorithm based on image content
and distortion for pseudo-reference image generation. Finally, the evaluation
is performed in the FR manner to assess the quality difference between the
contrast-enhanced (pseudoreference) and degraded images. Performance evaluation
of the proposed method on three databases containing contrast distortions
(CCID2014, TID2013, and CSIQ), indicates the promising performance of the
proposed method.

Abstract: Efficient and accurate classification of waste and industrial surface defects
is essential for ensuring sustainable waste management and maintaining high
standards in quality control. This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular
Classifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image
classification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone
for localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture
global semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is
incorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data,
enriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is
the neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that
dynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by
biological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data
complexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification,
we validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2),
which involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental
results across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms
traditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic
Modular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world
image classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and
industrial domains.

Abstract: While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically
pleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured
visuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand
composition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual
fidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic
investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training,
and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3
million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing
programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on
it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a
lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage
training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion,
and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at
inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for
generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an
accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&A
protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models
reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory.
Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning
yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset,
model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for
structured visuals.

Motivation: 研究文本到视频生成中的跨角色交互，解决角色从未共存和风格混合导致的风格失真问题，实现不同世界角色的自然互动。

Method: 使用交叉角色嵌入（CCE）学习跨多模态源的身份和行为逻辑，以及交叉角色增强（CCA）通过合成共存和混合风格数据丰富训练。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现先前不共存角色之间的自然交互，同时保持风格保真度，为生成式故事讲述开辟了新形式。

Abstract: Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where
characters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character
interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve
each character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context
interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and
because mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters
appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these
issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and
behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation
(CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style
data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously
uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a
curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show
clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and
robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative
storytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page:

Result: 在复杂的多步骤场景实验中，VChain显著提升了生成视频的质量

Conclusion: VChain通过注入多模态模型的视觉推理信号，实现了高效、低开销的视频生成质量提升

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing
clips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent
chain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state
transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and
multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and
future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain,
a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual
reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically,
VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to
generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used
to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only
at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal
overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex,
multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of
generated videos.

Abstract: General-purpose robots need a deep understanding of the physical world,
advanced reasoning, and general and dexterous control. This report introduces
the latest generation of the Gemini Robotics model family: Gemini Robotics 1.5,
a multi-embodiment Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model, and Gemini Robotics-ER
1.5, a state-of-the-art Embodied Reasoning (ER) model. We are bringing together
three major innovations. First, Gemini Robotics 1.5 features a novel
architecture and a Motion Transfer (MT) mechanism, which enables it to learn
from heterogeneous, multi-embodiment robot data and makes the VLA more general.
Second, Gemini Robotics 1.5 interleaves actions with a multi-level internal
reasoning process in natural language. This enables the robot to "think before
acting" and notably improves its ability to decompose and execute complex,
multi-step tasks, and also makes the robot's behavior more interpretable to the
user. Third, Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5 establishes a new state-of-the-art for
embodied reasoning, i.e., for reasoning capabilities that are critical for
robots, such as visual and spatial understanding, task planning, and progress
estimation. Together, this family of models takes us a step towards an era of
physical agents-enabling robots to perceive, think and then act so they can

Abstract: Elongate animals and robots use undulatory body waves to locomote through
diverse environments. Geometric mechanics provides a framework to model and
optimize such systems in highly damped environments, connecting a prescribed
shape change pattern (gait) with locomotion displacement. However, existing
approaches assume precise execution of prescribed gaits, whereas in practice
environmental interactions with compliant bodies of animals or robots
frequently perturb the realized trajectories. In this work, we extend geometric
mechanics to predict locomotor performance and search for optimal swimming
strategy of compliant undulators. We introduce a compliant extension of
Purcell's three-link swimmer by incorporating series-connected springs at the
joints. Body dynamics are derived with resistive force theory. Geometric
mechanics is incorporated into movement prediction and into an optimization
framework that identifies strategies for controlling compliant swimmers to
achieve maximal displacement. We validate our framework on a physical
cable-driven three-link limbless robot, and demonstrate accurate prediction and
optimization of locomotor performance under varied programmed, state-dependent
compliance in a granular medium. Our results establish a systematic
physics-based approach for modeling and controlling compliant swimming
locomotion, highlighting compliance as a design feature that can be exploited
for robust movement in homogeneous and heterogeneous environments.

Conclusion: 该学习生成初始化器为机器人运动规划提供了一种高效可靠的解决方案，特别适用于需要实时响应的HRC场景。

Abstract: Rapid robot motion generation is critical in Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
systems, as robots need to respond to dynamic environments in real time by
continuously observing their surroundings and replanning their motions to
ensure both safe interactions and efficient task execution. Current
sampling-based motion planners face challenges in scaling to high-dimensional
configuration spaces and often require post-processing to interpolate and
smooth the generated paths, resulting in time inefficiency in complex
environments. Optimization-based planners, on the other hand, can incorporate
multiple constraints and generate smooth trajectories directly, making them
potentially more time-efficient. However, optimization-based planners are
sensitive to initialization and may get stuck in local minima. In this work, we
present a novel learning-based method that utilizes a Flow Matching model
conditioned on a single-view point cloud to learn near-optimal solutions for
optimization initialization. Our method does not require prior knowledge of the
environment, such as obstacle locations and geometries, and can generate
feasible trajectories directly from single-view depth camera input. Simulation
studies on a UR5e robotic manipulator in cluttered workspaces demonstrate that
the proposed generative initializer achieves a high success rate on its own,
significantly improves the success rate of trajectory optimization compared
with traditional and learning-based benchmark initializers, requires fewer
optimization iterations, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen
environments.

Abstract: Robust adaptive control methods are essential for maintaining quadcopter
performance under external disturbances and model uncertainties. However,
fragmented evaluations across tasks, simulators, and implementations hinder
systematic comparison of these methods. This paper introduces an
easy-to-deploy, modular simulation testbed for quadcopter control, built on
RotorPy, that enables evaluation under a wide range of disturbances such as
wind, payload shifts, rotor faults, and control latency. The framework includes
a library of representative adaptive and non-adaptive controllers and provides
task-relevant metrics to assess tracking accuracy and robustness. The unified
modular environment enables reproducible evaluation across control methods and
eliminates redundant reimplementation of components such as disturbance models,
trajectory generators, and analysis tools. We illustrate the testbed's
versatility through examples spanning multiple disturbance scenarios and
trajectory types, including automated stress testing, to demonstrate its
utility for systematic analysis. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化目的地到滑槽的任务映射对于提高机器人分拣系统吞吐量至关重要，但由于系统复杂性（包括机器人目标分配、路径规划、滑槽周期性关闭以及下游处理影响）而具有挑战性。

Method: 首先正式定义任务映射和任务映射优化问题，然后开发机器人分拣系统模拟器，提出基于进化算法和混合整数线性规划的简单优化方法。

Conclusion: 通过质量多样性算法分析多样化任务映射的吞吐量，证明了优化任务映射对提高机器人分拣系统性能的有效性。

Abstract: We study optimizing a destination-to-chutes task mapping to improve
throughput in Robotic Sorting Systems (RSS), where a team of robots sort
packages on a sortation floor by transporting them from induct workstations to
eject chutes based on their shipping destinations (e.g. Los Angeles or
Pittsburgh). The destination-to-chutes task mapping is used to determine which
chutes a robot can drop its package. Finding a high-quality task mapping is
challenging because of the complexity of a real-world RSS. First, optimizing
task mapping is interdependent with robot target assignment and path planning.
Second, chutes will be CLOSED for a period of time once they receive sufficient
packages to allow for downstream processing. Third, task mapping quality
directly impacts the downstream processing, as scattered chutes for the same
destination increase package handling time. In this paper, we first formally
define task mappings and the problem of Task Mapping Optimization (TMO). We
then present a simulator of RSS to evaluate task mappings. We then present a
simple TMO method based on the Evolutionary Algorithm and Mixed Integer Linear
Programming, demonstrating the advantage of our optimized task mappings over
the greedily generated ones in various RSS setups with different map sizes,
numbers of chutes, and destinations. Finally, we use Quality Diversity
algorithms to analyze the throughput of a diverse set of task mappings. Our
code is available online at https://github.com/lunjohnzhang/tmo_public.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对区间马尔可夫决策过程(IMDPs)的鲁棒宽松控制器合成框架，保证所有符合合成多策略的策略在所有允许转移下满足可达性或基于奖励的规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在不确定动态下运行的鲁棒控制器合成问题，传统控制器合成产生单一确定性策略，限制了适应性，而宽松控制器允许多个动作，但先前工作假设精确转移概率，这在机器人应用中不现实。

Method: 将问题建模为混合整数线性规划(MILPs)，提出了两种编码方法：基线顶点枚举法和避免显式枚举的可扩展对偶方法。

Result: 在四个基准域上的实验表明，两种方法都能合成鲁棒、最大宽松的控制器，并可扩展到具有数十万个状态的大型IMDPs。

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现了在IMDPs上的鲁棒宽松控制器合成，提供了运行时灵活性和弹性，适用于具有不确定性的机器人应用。

Abstract: We address the problem of robust permissive controller synthesis for robots
operating under uncertain dynamics, modeled as Interval Markov Decision
Processes (IMDPs). IMDPs generalize standard MDPs by allowing transition
probabilities to vary within intervals, capturing epistemic uncertainty from
sensing noise, actuation imprecision, and coarse system abstractions-common in
robotics. Traditional controller synthesis typically yields a single
deterministic strategy, limiting adaptability. In contrast, permissive
controllers (multi-strategies) allow multiple actions per state, enabling
runtime flexibility and resilience. However, prior work on permissive
controller synthesis generally assumes exact transition probabilities, which is
unrealistic in many robotic applications. We present the first framework for
robust permissive controller synthesis on IMDPs, guaranteeing that all
strategies compliant with the synthesized multi-strategy satisfy reachability
or reward-based specifications under all admissible transitions. We formulate
the problem as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and propose two encodings:
a baseline vertex-enumeration method and a scalable duality-based method that
avoids explicit enumeration. Experiments on four benchmark domains show that
both methods synthesize robust, maximally permissive controllers and scale to
large IMDPs with up to hundreds of thousands of states.

Conclusion: 通过预测性人体建模与数字孪生验证的集成，该方法在精度和可靠性方面优于现有仅基于运动学的规划器。

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration requires precise prediction of human motion over
extended horizons to enable proactive collision avoidance. Unlike existing
planners that rely solely on kinodynamic models, we present a prediction-driven
safe planning framework that leverages granular, joint-by-joint human motion
forecasting validated in a physics-based digital twin. A capsule-based
artificial potential field (APF) converts these granular predictions into
collision risk metrics, triggering an Adaptive RRT* (A-RRT*) planner when
thresholds are exceeded. The depth camera is used to extract 3D skeletal poses
and a convolutional neural network-bidirectional long short-term memory
(CNN-BiLSTM) model to predict individual joint trajectories ahead of time. A
digital twin model integrates real-time human posture prediction placed in
front of a simulated robot to evaluate motions and physical contacts. The
proposed method enables validation of planned trajectories ahead of time and
bridging potential latency gaps in updating planned trajectories in real-time.
In 50 trials, our method achieved 100% proactive avoidance with > 250 mm
clearance and sub-2 s replanning, demonstrating superior precision and
reliability compared to existing kinematic-only planners through the
integration of predictive human modeling with digital twin validation.

Abstract: Maintaining connectivity is crucial in many multi-robot applications, yet
fragile to obstacles and visual occlusions. We present a real-time distributed
framework for multi-robot navigation certified by high-order control barrier
functions (HOCBFs) that controls inter-robot proximity to maintain connectivity
while avoiding collisions. We incorporate control Lyapunov functions to enable
connectivity recovery from initial disconnected configurations and temporary
losses, providing robust connectivity during navigation in obstacle-rich
environments. Our trajectory generation framework concurrently produces
planning and control through a Bezier-parameterized trajectory, which naturally
provides smooth curves with arbitrary degree of derivatives. The main
contribution is the unified MPC-CLF-CBF framework, a continuous-time trajectory
generation and control method for connectivity maintenance and recovery of
multi-robot systems. We validate the framework through extensive simulations
and a physical experiment with 4 Crazyflie nano-quadrotors.

Abstract: Robotic laparoscopic surgery has gained increasing attention in recent years
for its potential to deliver more efficient and precise minimally invasive
procedures. However, adoption of surgical robotic platforms remains largely
confined to high-resource medical centers, exacerbating healthcare disparities
in rural and low-resource regions. To close this gap, a range of solutions has
been explored, from remote mentorship to fully remote telesurgery. Yet, the
practical deployment of surgical robotic systems to underserved communities
remains an unsolved challenge. Humanoid systems offer a promising path toward
deployability, as they can directly operate in environments designed for humans
without extensive infrastructure modifications -- including operating rooms. In
this work, we introduce LapSurgie, the first humanoid-robot-based laparoscopic
teleoperation framework. The system leverages an inverse-mapping strategy for
manual-wristed laparoscopic instruments that abides to remote center-of-motion
constraints, enabling precise hand-to-tool control of off-the-shelf surgical
laparoscopic tools without additional setup requirements. A control console
equipped with a stereo vision system provides real-time visual feedback.
Finally, a comprehensive user study across platforms demonstrates the
effectiveness of the proposed framework and provides initial evidence for the
feasibility of deploying humanoid robots in laparoscopic procedures.

Conclusion: 该框架为微创手术机器人提供了一种高效、准确的相机-机器人标定解决方案，特别适用于在线机器人控制场景。

Abstract: Accurate camera-to-robot calibration is essential for any vision-based
robotic control system and especially critical in minimally invasive surgical
robots, where instruments conduct precise micro-manipulations. However, MIS
robots have long kinematic chains and partial visibility of their degrees of
freedom in the camera, which introduces challenges for conventional
camera-to-robot calibration methods that assume stiff robots with good
visibility. Previous works have investigated both keypoint-based and
rendering-based approaches to address this challenge in real-world conditions;
however, they often struggle with consistent feature detection or have long
inference times, neither of which are ideal for online robot control. In this
work, we propose a novel framework that unifies the detection of geometric
primitives (keypoints and shaft edges) through a shared encoding, enabling
efficient pose estimation via projection geometry. This architecture detects
both keypoints and edges in a single inference and is trained on large-scale
synthetic data with projective labeling. This method is evaluated across both
feature detection and pose estimation, with qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrating fast performance and state-of-the-art accuracy in
challenging surgical environments.

Method: 使用受形态弹性和主动细丝理论启发的生物力学模型预计算形状库，在形状空间中构建k近邻图，利用符号距离函数修剪与障碍物碰撞的节点和边，定义基于几何距离和驱动力的多目标边成本。

Result: 算法能够可靠地避开障碍物，在毫秒级时间内从预计算图中生成可行路径，包含能量成本可以显著减少驱动力，但代价是更长的末端轨迹。

Conclusion: 形状空间图搜索为软体机器人领域提供了快速可靠的路径规划方法，为手术、工业和辅助环境中的实时应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Soft robots, inspired by elephant trunks or octopus arms, offer extraordinary
flexibility to bend, twist, and elongate in ways that rigid robots cannot.
However, their motion planning remains a challenge, especially in cluttered
environments with obstacles, due to their highly nonlinear and
infinite-dimensional kinematics. Here, we present a graph-based path planning
tool for an elephant-trunk-inspired soft robotic arm designed with three
artificial muscle fibers that allow for multimodal continuous deformation
through contraction. Using a biomechanical model inspired by morphoelasticity
and active filament theory, we precompute a shape library and construct a
$k$-nearest neighbor graph in \emph{shape space}, ensuring that each node
corresponds to a mechanically accurate and physically valid robot shape. For
the graph, we use signed distance functions to prune nodes and edges colliding
with obstacles, and define multi-objective edge costs based on geometric
distance and actuation effort, enabling energy-efficient planning with
collision avoidance. We demonstrate that our algorithm reliably avoids
obstacles and generates feasible paths within milliseconds from precomputed
graphs using Dijkstra's algorithm. We show that including energy costs can
drastically reduce the actuation effort compared to geometry-only planning, at
the expense of longer tip trajectories. Our results highlight the potential of
shape-space graph search for fast and reliable path planning in the field of
soft robotics, paving the way for real-time applications in surgical,
industrial, and assistive settings.

Conclusion: 显式接触推理显著提高对未见场景的泛化能力，接触显式策略学习为可扩展的运动操作提供了有前景的基础

Abstract: We present a unified framework for multi-task locomotion and manipulation
policy learning grounded in a contact-explicit representation. Instead of
designing different policies for different tasks, our approach unifies the
definition of a task through a sequence of contact goals-desired contact
positions, timings, and active end-effectors. This enables leveraging the
shared structure across diverse contact-rich tasks, leading to a single policy
that can perform a wide range of tasks. In particular, we train a
goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) policy to realise given contact
plans. We validate our framework on multiple robotic embodiments and tasks: a
quadruped performing multiple gaits, a humanoid performing multiple biped and
quadrupedal gaits, and a humanoid executing different bimanual object
manipulation tasks. Each of these scenarios is controlled by a single policy
trained to execute different tasks grounded in contacts, demonstrating
versatile and robust behaviours across morphologically distinct systems. Our
results show that explicit contact reasoning significantly improves
generalisation to unseen scenarios, positioning contact-explicit policy
learning as a promising foundation for scalable loco-manipulation.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous vehicles necessitates advanced path planning
and obstacle avoidance capabilities, particularly in dynamic environments. This
paper introduces a bi-level control framework that efficiently augments road
boundaries by incorporating time-dependent grid projections of obstacle
movements, thus enabling precise and adaptive path planning. The main control
loop utilizes Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) for real-time path
optimization, wherein homotopy-based constraint relaxation is employed to
improve the solvability of the optimal control problem (OCP). Furthermore, an
independent backup loop runs concurrently to provide safe fallback trajectories
when an optimal trajectory cannot be computed by the main loop within a
critical time frame, thus enhancing safety and real-time performance. Our
evaluation showcases the benefits of the proposed methods in various driving
scenarios, highlighting the real-time applicability and robustness of our
approach. Overall, the framework represents a significant step towards safer
and more reliable autonomous driving in complex and dynamic environments.

Conclusion: 提出的坐标无关静态模型为硬磁壳的分析和形状变形控制提供了高效工具，特别适用于大变形情况下的软磁机器人应用。

Abstract: Cosserat rod theory is the popular approach to modeling ferromagnetic soft
robots as 1-Dimensional (1D) slender structures in most applications, such as
biomedical. However, recent soft robots designed for locomotion and
manipulation often exhibit a large width-to-length ratio that categorizes them
as 2D shells. For analysis and shape-morphing control purposes, we develop an
efficient coordinate-free static model of hard-magnetic shells found in soft
magnetic grippers and walking soft robots. The approach is based on a novel
formulation of Cosserat shell theory on the Special Euclidean group
($\mathbf{SE}(3)$). The shell is assumed to be a 2D manifold of material points
with six degrees of freedom (position & rotation) suitable for capturing the
behavior of a uniformly distributed array of spheroidal hard magnetic particles
embedded in the rheological elastomer. The shell's configuration manifold is
the space of all smooth embeddings $\mathbb{R}^2\rightarrow\mathbf{SE}(3)$.
According to a novel definition of local deformation gradient based on the Lie
group structure of $\mathbf{SE}(3)$, we derive the strong and weak forms of
equilibrium equations, following the principle of virtual work. We extract the
linearized version of the weak form for numerical implementations. The
resulting finite element approach can avoid well-known challenges such as
singularity and locking phenomenon in modeling shell structures. The proposed
model is analytically and experimentally validated through a series of test
cases that demonstrate its superior efficacy, particularly when the shell
undergoes severe rotations and displacements.

Abstract: Robots with internal visual self-models promise unprecedented adaptability,
yet existing autonomous modeling pipelines remain fragile under realistic
sensing conditions such as noisy imagery and cluttered backgrounds. This paper
presents the first systematic study quantifying how visual
degradations--including blur, salt-and-pepper noise, and Gaussian noise--affect
robotic self-modeling. Through both simulation and physical experiments, we
demonstrate their impact on morphology prediction, trajectory planning, and
damage recovery in state-of-the-art pipelines. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce a task-aware denoising framework that couples classical restoration
with morphology-preserving constraints, ensuring retention of structural cues
critical for self-modeling. In addition, we integrate semantic segmentation to
robustly isolate robots from cluttered and colorful scenes. Extensive
experiments show that our approach restores near-baseline performance across
simulated and physical platforms, while existing pipelines degrade
significantly. These contributions advance the robustness of visual
self-modeling and establish practical foundations for deploying self-aware
robots in unpredictable real-world environments.

video and a target robot embodiment. We train a closed-loop robot manipulation
policy over the data produced by EmbodiSwap. We make novel use of V-JEPA as a
visual backbone, repurposing V-JEPA from the domain of video understanding to
imitation learning over synthetic robot videos. Adoption of V-JEPA outperforms
alternative vision backbones more conventionally used within robotics. In
real-world tests, our zero-shot trained V-JEPA model achieves an $82\%$ success
rate, outperforming a few-shot trained $\pi_0$ network as well as $\pi_0$
trained over data produced by EmbodiSwap. We release (i) code for generating
the synthetic robot overlays which takes as input human videos and an arbitrary
robot URDF and generates a robot dataset, (ii) the robot dataset we synthesize
over EPIC-Kitchens, HOI4D and Ego4D, and (iii) model checkpoints and inference
code, to facilitate reproducible research and broader adoption.

Conclusion: 该框架成功展示了单一学习模型处理多种推动任务的能力，支持侧向切换、可变长度推动和不同目标，为数据驱动的非抓取操作提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Data-driven planar pushing methods have recently gained attention as they
reduce manual engineering effort and improve generalization compared to
analytical approaches. However, most prior work targets narrow capabilities
(e.g., side switching, precision, or single-task training), limiting broader
applicability. We present a model-based framework for non-prehensile tabletop
pushing that uses a single learned model to address multiple tasks without
retraining. Our approach employs a recurrent GRU-based architecture with
additional non-linear layers to capture object-environment dynamics while
ensuring stability. A tailored state-action representation enables the model to
generalize across uncertain dynamics, variable push lengths, and diverse tasks.
For control, we integrate the learned dynamics with a sampling-based Model
Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller, which generates adaptive,
task-oriented actions. This framework supports side switching, variable-length
pushes, and objectives such as precise positioning, trajectory following, and
obstacle avoidance. Training is performed in simulation with domain
randomization to support sim-to-real transfer. We first evaluate the
architecture through ablation studies, showing improved prediction accuracy and
stable rollouts. We then validate the full system in simulation and real-world
experiments using a Franka Panda robot with markerless tracking. Results
demonstrate high success rates in precise positioning under strict thresholds
and strong performance in trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance. Moreover,
multiple tasks are solved simply by changing the controller's objective
function, without retraining. While our current focus is on a single object
type, we extend the framework by training on wider push lengths and designing a
balanced controller that reduces the number of steps for longer-horizon goals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂动态环境中，机器人需要预测周围智能体的未来动作和意图以实现高效导航和避障。由于智能体的动态特性取决于其任务、角色或可观察标签，类别条件运动预测成为减少预测不确定性和提高预测精度的有效方法。

Method: 提出了基于条件的模式方法和高效的深度学习基线方法，并在THÖR-MAGNI和Stanford Drone Dataset两个数据集上评估了这些方法的性能。

Result: 实验表明，考虑类别标签时大多数方法的准确性都有所提高。深度学习在平衡数据集上表现更好，但在数据有限（如新环境冷启动）或类别不平衡的情况下，基于模式的方法可能更优。

Conclusion: 类别条件轨迹预测能有效提高预测精度，但在实际应用中需要根据数据可用性和类别平衡情况选择合适的方法，深度学习适合平衡数据集，模式方法更适合有限数据或类别不平衡场景。

Abstract: Robots and other intelligent systems navigating in complex dynamic
environments should predict future actions and intentions of surrounding agents
to reach their goals efficiently and avoid collisions. The dynamics of those
agents strongly depends on their tasks, roles, or observable labels.
Class-conditioned motion prediction is thus an appealing way to reduce forecast
uncertainty and get more accurate predictions for heterogeneous agents.
However, this is hardly explored in the prior art, especially for mobile robots
and in limited data applications. In this paper, we analyse different
class-conditioned trajectory prediction methods on two datasets. We propose a
set of conditional pattern-based and efficient deep learning-based baselines,
and evaluate their performance on robotics and outdoors datasets (TH\"OR-MAGNI
and Stanford Drone Dataset). Our experiments show that all methods improve
accuracy in most of the settings when considering class labels. More
importantly, we observe that there are significant differences when learning
from imbalanced datasets, or in new environments where sufficient data is not
available. In particular, we find that deep learning methods perform better on
balanced datasets, but in applications with limited data, e.g., cold start of a
robot in a new environment, or imbalanced classes, pattern-based methods may be
preferable.

Motivation: 在准静态环境中，大多数障碍物保持静态但部分障碍物会变化，这种结构化变化可以被系统利用以提供比一般运动规划问题更强的保证。现有方法要么缺乏形式化保证，要么依赖限制性的障碍物配置离散化，限制了在实际领域的应用。

Method: COVER框架通过划分障碍物配置空间，在每个分区内求解可行路径，并系统验证路线图在每个分区中的可行性，从而保证在验证区域内固定时间运动规划查询。

Result: 在7自由度模拟Panda机器人执行桌面和货架任务的实验中，COVER比先前工作实现了更广泛的覆盖范围和更高的查询成功率。

Conclusion: COVER框架能够有效处理准静态环境中的运动规划问题，提供形式化保证并提高实际应用中的性能表现。

Abstract: Having the ability to answer motion-planning queries within a fixed time
budget is critical for the widespread deployment of robotic systems.
Semi-static environments, where most obstacles remain static but a limited set
can vary across queries, exhibit structured variability that can be
systematically exploited to provide stronger guarantees than in general
motion-planning problems. However, prior approaches in this setting either lack
formal guarantees or rely on restrictive discretizations of obstacle
configurations, limiting their applicability in realistic domains. This paper
introduces COVER, a novel framework that incrementally constructs a
coverage-verified roadmap in semi-static environments. By partitioning the
obstacle configuration space and solving for feasible paths within each
partition, COVER systematically verifies feasibility of the roadmap in each
partition and guarantees fixed-time motion planning queries within the verified
regions. We validate COVER with a 7-DOF simulated Panda robot performing table
and shelf tasks, demonstrating that COVER achieves broader coverage with higher
query success rates than prior works.

Motivation: 现有移动操作策略主要依赖图像输入，缺乏全局场景理解和长期记忆能力，限制了在复杂环境中的表现。

Method: 通过多视角观察增量融合构建3D潜在特征地图，使用预训练解码器重建目标嵌入，并采用3D特征聚合器为策略提供全局上下文。

Result: SBP在场景级移动操作和顺序桌面操作任务中表现出色，相比基于图像的策略成功率提升25%，特别是在新场景中表现更好。

Conclusion: 3D潜在地图为移动操作策略提供了更强的空间推理和长期记忆能力，是实现复杂操作任务的有效方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that mobile manipulation policies utilizing a
3D latent map achieve stronger spatial and temporal reasoning than policies
relying solely on images. We introduce Seeing the Bigger Picture (SBP), an
end-to-end policy learning approach that operates directly on a 3D map of
latent features. In SBP, the map extends perception beyond the robot's current
field of view and aggregates observations over long horizons. Our mapping
approach incrementally fuses multiview observations into a grid of
scene-specific latent features. A pre-trained, scene-agnostic decoder
reconstructs target embeddings from these features and enables online
optimization of the map features during task execution. A policy, trainable
with behavior cloning or reinforcement learning, treats the latent map as a
state variable and uses global context from the map obtained via a 3D feature
aggregator. We evaluate SBP on scene-level mobile manipulation and sequential
tabletop manipulation tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that SBP (i) reasons
globally over the scene, (ii) leverages the map as long-horizon memory, and
(iii) outperforms image-based policies in both in-distribution and novel
scenes, e.g., improving the success rate by 25% for the sequential manipulation
task.

TL;DR: NoTVLA框架通过聚焦稀疏轨迹而非密集动作序列，解决了VLA模型中的灾难性遗忘问题，在计算资源减少一个数量级且无需腕部摄像头的情况下，实现了多任务场景下的优越性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision-Language-Action模型在实际部署中面临的灾难性遗忘问题，该问题源于对连续动作序列的过度依赖，导致知识在不同任务间难以保持。

Method: 提出NoTVLA框架：1）采用稀疏轨迹而非密集动作轨迹；2）创新性地规划机器人末端执行器的轨迹，而非目标物体的轨迹；3）利用时间压缩和空间推理剪枝技术。

Result: 在多任务评估场景中，NoTVLA相比pi0表现出更优越的性能和泛化能力，计算资源使用减少一个数量级，无需腕部摄像头，操作精度接近单任务专家模型。

Conclusion: NoTVLA框架有效解决了VLA模型的灾难性遗忘问题，保持了模型的语言能力，支持跨多个机器人平台的统一部署，并在新视角任务中展现出泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied
intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment,
most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance
on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create
isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle
these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA)
framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories,
thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory
fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning
strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages
temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot
end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these
sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that
delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot.
In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and
generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints:
it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires
no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy
closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also
preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot
generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment
across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even
when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.

Motivation: 全球数百万人需要喂食协助，现有机器人喂食系统因难以准确估计咬合时机而推广受限，需要开发更自然、反应更灵敏的解决方案。

Method: 使用可穿戴传感器数据训练监督回归模型预测咬合时机，结合用户可调节的主动性阈值将预测转换为继续或停止指令，并在Obi喂食机器人上进行验证。

Conclusion: WAFFLE能够实现自然、反应灵敏的咬合时机预测，并具有跨用户、机器人硬件、位置、喂食轨迹、食物类型以及个人和社交用餐环境的泛化能力。

Abstract: Millions of people around the world need assistance with feeding. Robotic
feeding systems offer the potential to enhance autonomy and quality of life for
individuals with impairments and reduce caregiver workload. However, their
widespread adoption has been limited by technical challenges such as estimating
bite timing, the appropriate moment for the robot to transfer food to a user's
mouth. In this work, we introduce WAFFLE: Wearable Approach For Feeding with
LEarned bite timing, a system that accurately predicts bite timing by
leveraging wearable sensor data to be highly reactive to natural user cues such
as head movements, chewing, and talking. We train a supervised regression model
on bite timing data from 14 participants and incorporate a user-adjustable
assertiveness threshold to convert predictions into proceed or stop commands.
In a study with 15 participants without motor impairments with the Obi feeding
robot, WAFFLE performs statistically on par with or better than baseline
methods across measures of feeling of control, robot understanding, and
workload, and is preferred by the majority of participants for both individual
and social dining. We further demonstrate WAFFLE's generalizability in a study
with 2 participants with motor impairments in their home environments using a
Kinova 7DOF robot. Our findings support WAFFLE's effectiveness in enabling
natural, reactive bite timing that generalizes across users, robot hardware,
robot positioning, feeding trajectories, foods, and both individual and social
dining contexts.

Conclusion: 在焦平面传感器处理器阵列上实现高帧率视觉惯性里程计能有效减少空间和时间漂移，提高定位精度。

Abstract: Vision algorithms can be executed directly on the image sensor when
implemented on the next-generation sensors known as focal-plane
sensor-processor arrays (FPSP)s, where every pixel has a processor. FPSPs
greatly improve latency, reducing the problems associated with the bottleneck
of data transfer from a vision sensor to a processor. FPSPs accelerate
vision-based algorithms such as visual-inertial odometry (VIO). However, VIO
frameworks suffer from spatial drift due to the vision-based pose estimation,
whilst temporal drift arises from the inertial measurements. FPSPs circumvent
the spatial drift by operating at a high frame rate to match the high-frequency
output of the inertial measurements. In this paper, we present TCB-VIO, a
tightly-coupled 6 degrees-of-freedom VIO by a Multi-State Constraint Kalman
Filter (MSCKF), operating at a high frame-rate of 250 FPS and from IMU
measurements obtained at 400 Hz. TCB-VIO outperforms state-of-the-art methods:

Abstract: Off-road environments present unique challenges for autonomous navigation due
to their complex and unstructured nature. Traditional global path-planning
methods, which typically aim to minimize path length and travel time, perform
poorly on large-scale maps and fail to account for critical factors such as
real-time performance, kinematic feasibility, and memory efficiency. This paper
introduces a novel global path-planning method specifically designed for
off-road environments, addressing these essential factors. The method begins by
constructing an intermediate map within the pixel coordinate system,
incorporating geographical features like off-road trails, waterways, restricted
and passable areas, and trees. The planning problem is then divided into three
sub-problems: graph-based path planning, kinematic feasibility checking, and
path smoothing. This approach effectively meets real-time performance
requirements while ensuring kinematic feasibility and efficient memory use. The
method was tested in various off-road environments with large-scale maps up to
several square kilometers in size, successfully identifying feasible paths in
an average of 1.5 seconds and utilizing approximately 1.5GB of memory under
extreme conditions. The proposed framework is versatile and applicable to a
wide range of off-road autonomous navigation tasks, including search and rescue
missions and agricultural operations.

Result: 在SIMPLER环境中，SITCOM结合良好奖励函数可将任务完成率从48%提升至72%。

Conclusion: SITCOM框架成功地将单步VLA模型转化为鲁棒的长时域规划器，显著提高了任务完成性能。

Abstract: Learning robust robotic control policies remains a major challenge due to the
high cost of collecting labeled data, limited generalization to unseen
environments, and difficulties in planning over long horizons. While
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a promising solution by grounding
natural language instructions into single-step control commands, they often
lack mechanisms for lookahead and struggle with compounding errors in dynamic
tasks. In this project, we introduce Scaling Inference-Time COMpute for VLAs
(SITCOM), a framework that augments any pretrained VLA with model-based
rollouts and reward-based trajectory selection, inspired by Model Predictive
Control algorithm. SITCOM leverages a learned dynamics model to simulate
multi-step action rollouts to select the best candidate plan for real-world
execution, transforming one-shot VLAs into robust long-horizon planners. We
develop an efficient transformer-based dynamics model trained on large-scale
BridgeV2 data and fine-tuned on SIMPLER environments to bridge the Real2Sim
gap, and score candidate rollouts using rewards from simulator. Through
comprehensive evaluation across multiple tasks and settings in the SIMPLER
environment, we demonstrate that SITCOM when combined with a good reward
function can significantly improve task completion rate from 48% to 72% using
trained dynamics model.

Conclusion: 反馈机制对于自主手术系统至关重要，所提出的框架能够有效处理组织解剖中的动态变化和感知挑战。

Abstract: Autonomous surgical systems must adapt to highly dynamic environments where
tissue properties and visual cues evolve rapidly. Central to such adaptability
is feedback: the ability to sense, interpret, and respond to changes during
execution. While feedback mechanisms have been explored in surgical robotics,
ranging from tool and tissue tracking to error detection, existing methods
remain limited in handling the topological and perceptual challenges of tissue
dissection. In this work, we propose a feedback-enabled framework for
autonomous tissue dissection that explicitly reasons about topological changes
from endoscopic images after each dissection action. This structured feedback
guides subsequent actions, enabling the system to localize dissection progress
and adapt policies online. To improve the reliability of such feedback, we
introduce visibility metrics that quantify tissue exposure and formulate
optimal controller designs that actively manipulate tissue to maximize
visibility. Finally, we integrate these feedback mechanisms with both
planning-based and learning-based dissection methods, and demonstrate
experimentally that they significantly enhance autonomy, reduce errors, and
improve robustness in complex surgical scenarios.

Abstract: One of the main challenges in modern control applications, particularly in
robot and vehicle motion control, is achieving accurate, fast, and safe
movement. To address this, optimal control policies have been developed to
enforce safety while ensuring high performance. Since basic first-principles
models of real systems are often available, model-based controllers are widely
used. Model predictive control (MPC) is a leading approach that optimizes
performance while explicitly handling safety constraints. However, obtaining
accurate models for complex systems is difficult, which motivates data-driven
alternatives. ML-based MPC leverages learned models to reduce reliance on
hand-crafted dynamics, while reinforcement learning (RL) can learn near-optimal
policies directly from interaction data. Data-enabled predictive control
(DeePC) goes further by bypassing modeling altogether, directly learning safe
policies from raw input-output data. Recently, large language model (LLM)
agents have also emerged, translating natural language instructions into
structured formulations of optimal control problems. Despite these advances,
data-driven policies face significant limitations. They often suffer from slow
response times, high computational demands, and large memory needs, making them
less practical for real-world systems with fast dynamics, limited onboard
computing, or strict memory constraints. To address this, various technique,
such as reduced-order modeling, function-approximated policy learning, and
convex relaxations, have been proposed to reduce computational complexity. In
this paper, we present eight such approaches and demonstrate their
effectiveness across real-world applications, including robotic arms, soft
robots, and vehicle motion control.

Conclusion: HEHA框架通过分层规划和PEAF算法有效解决了多异构机器人探索中的路径规划问题，显著提升了探索效率。

Abstract: This paper considers the path planning problem for autonomous exploration of
an unknown environment using multiple heterogeneous robots such as drones,
wheeled, and legged robots, which have different capabilities to traverse
complex terrains. A key challenge there is to intelligently allocate the robots
to the unknown areas to be explored and determine the visiting order of those
spaces subject to traversablity constraints, which leads to a large scale
constrained optimization problem that needs to be quickly and iteratively
solved every time when new space are explored. To address the challenge, we
propose HEHA (Hierarchical Exploration with Heterogeneous Agents) by leveraging
a recent hierarchical method that decompose the exploration into global
planning and local planning. The major contribution in HEHA is its global
planning, where we propose a new routing algorithm PEAF (Partial Anytime Focal
search) that can quickly find bounded sub-optimal solutions to minimize the
maximum path length among the agents subject to traversability constraints.
Additionally, the local planner in HEHA also considers heterogeneity to avoid
repeated and duplicated exploration among the robots. The experimental results

Abstract: Rock capturing with standard excavator buckets is a challenging task
typically requiring the expertise of skilled operators. Unlike soil digging, it
involves manipulating large, irregular rocks in unstructured environments where
complex contact interactions with granular material make model-based control
impractical. Existing autonomous excavation methods focus mainly on continuous
media or rely on specialized grippers, limiting their applicability to
real-world construction sites. This paper introduces a fully data-driven
control framework for rock capturing that eliminates the need for explicit
modeling of rock or soil properties. A model-free reinforcement learning agent
is trained in the AGX Dynamics simulator using the Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) algorithm and a guiding reward formulation. The learned policy outputs
joint velocity commands directly to the boom, arm, and bucket of a CAT365
excavator model. Robustness is enhanced through extensive domain randomization
of rock geometry, density, and mass, as well as the initial configurations of
the bucket, rock, and goal position. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study to develop and evaluate an RL-based controller for the rock
capturing task. Experimental results show that the policy generalizes well to
unseen rocks and varying soil conditions, achieving high success rates
comparable to those of human participants while maintaining machine stability.
These findings demonstrate the feasibility of learning-based excavation
strategies for discrete object manipulation without requiring specialized
hardware or detailed material models.

Abstract: In Mobile Manipulation, selecting an optimal mobile base pose is essential
for successful object grasping. Previous works have addressed this problem
either through classical planning methods or by learning state-based policies.
They assume access to reliable state information, such as the precise object
poses and environment models. In this work, we study base pose planning
directly from top-down orthographic projections of the scene, which provide a
global overview of the scene while preserving spatial structure. We propose
VBM-NET, a learning-based method for base pose selection using such top-down
orthographic projections. We use equivariant TransporterNet to exploit spatial
symmetries and efficiently learn candidate base poses for grasping. Further, we
use graph neural networks to represent a varying number of candidate base poses
and use Reinforcement Learning to determine the optimal base pose among them.
We show that VBM-NET can produce comparable solutions to the classical methods
in significantly less computation time. Furthermore, we validate sim-to-real
transfer by successfully deploying a policy trained in simulation to real-world
mobile manipulation.

Abstract: Transcatheter valve repair presents significant challenges due to the
mechanical limitations and steep learning curve associated with manual catheter
systems. This paper investigates the use of robotics to facilitate
transcatheter procedures in the context of mitral valve edge-to-edge repair.
The complex handle-based control of a clinical repair device is replaced by
intuitive robotic joint-based control via a game controller. Manual versus
robotic performance is analyzed by decomposing the overall device delivery task
into motion-specific steps and comparing capabilities on a step-by-step basis
in a phantom model of the heart and vasculature. Metrics include procedure
duration and clip placement accuracy. Results demonstrate that the robotic
system can reduce procedural time and motion errors while also improving
accuracy of clip placement. These findings suggest that robotic assistance can
address key limitations of manual systems, offering a more reliable and
user-friendly platform for complex transcatheter procedures.

Abstract: In the study, the social robot act as a patrol to recognize and notify
illegal parking in real-time. Dual-model pipeline method and large multimodal
model were compared, and the GPT-4o multimodal model was adopted in license
plate recognition without preprocessing. For moving smoothly on a flat ground,
the robot navigated in a simulated parking lot in the experiments. The robot
changes angle view of the camera automatically to capture the images around
with the format of license plate number. From the captured images of the robot,
the numbers on the plate are recognized through the GPT-4o model, and
identifies legality of the numbers. When an illegal parking is detected, the
robot sends Line messages to the system manager immediately. The contribution
of the work is that a novel multimodal deep learning method has validated with
high accuracy in license plate recognition, and a social assistive robot is
also provided for solving problems in a real scenario, and can be applied in an
indoor parking lot.

TL;DR: 提出Diffusion-MPC方法，使用生成扩散模型作为近似动力学先验进行规划，实现测试时通过奖励和约束优化的灵活适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型自由强化学习方法产生固定策略难以适应新行为，而传统MPC需要准确动力学模型。需要一种既能灵活适应又不需要精确模型的方法。

Method: 使用生成扩散模型作为动力学先验，在反向步骤中结合奖励规划和约束投影，通过交互训练算法更新去噪器。

Result: 在真实世界中验证了强大的运动能力和灵活适应能力，能够适应新的奖励规范而无需重新训练。

Conclusion: Diffusion-MPC结合了扩散模型和MPC的优势，提供了强大的测试时适应能力，是解决腿式运动控制问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Legged locomotion demands controllers that are both robust and adaptable,
while remaining compatible with task and safety considerations. However,
model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods often yield a fixed policy that
can be difficult to adapt to new behaviors at test time. In contrast, Model
Predictive Control (MPC) provides a natural approach to flexible behavior
synthesis by incorporating different objectives and constraints directly into
its optimization process. However, classical MPC relies on accurate dynamics
models, which are often difficult to obtain in complex environments and
typically require simplifying assumptions. We present Diffusion-MPC, which
leverages a learned generative diffusion model as an approximate dynamics prior
for planning, enabling flexible test-time adaptation through reward and
constraint based optimization. Diffusion-MPC jointly predicts future states and
actions; at each reverse step, we incorporate reward planning and impose
constraint projection, yielding trajectories that satisfy task objectives while
remaining within physical limits. To obtain a planning model that adapts beyond
imitation pretraining, we introduce an interactive training algorithm for
diffusion based planner: we execute our reward-and-constraint planner in
environment, then filter and reweight the collected trajectories by their
realized returns before updating the denoiser. Our design enables strong
test-time adaptability, allowing the planner to adjust to new reward
specifications without retraining. We validate Diffusion-MPC on real world,
demonstrating strong locomotion and flexible adaptation.

Motivation: 现有行为克隆方法在使用多帧观测时性能提升不一致，而视觉-语言-动作模型(VLA)能更有效地利用多帧观测，但视频输入的高维度带来了显著的计算开销。

Method: ContextVLA将过去观测压缩为单个上下文token，使策略能够高效地利用时序上下文进行动作生成，同时减少训练和推理时间。

Conclusion: ContextVLA通过压缩多帧观测为上下文token，在保持性能提升的同时显著提高了VLA模型的训练和推理效率。

Abstract: Leveraging temporal context is crucial for success in partially observable
robotic tasks. However, prior work in behavior cloning has demonstrated
inconsistent performance gains when using multi-frame observations. In this
paper, we introduce ContextVLA, a policy model that robustly improves robotic
task performance by effectively leveraging multi-frame observations. Our
approach is motivated by the key observation that Vision-Language-Action models
(VLA), i.e., policy models built upon a Vision-Language Model (VLM), more
effectively utilize multi-frame observations for action generation. This
suggests that VLMs' inherent temporal understanding capability enables them to
extract more meaningful context from multi-frame observations. However, the
high dimensionality of video inputs introduces significant computational
overhead, making VLA training and inference inefficient. To address this,
ContextVLA compresses past observations into a single context token, allowing
the policy to efficiently leverage temporal context for action generation. Our
experiments show that ContextVLA consistently improves over single-frame VLAs
and achieves the benefits of full multi-frame training but with reduced
training and inference times.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) faces significant limitations when applied to
systems evolving on nonlinear manifolds, such as robotic attitude dynamics and
constrained motion planning, where traditional Euclidean formulations struggle
with singularities, over-parameterization, and poor convergence. To overcome
these challenges, this paper introduces FactorMPC, a factor-graph based MPC
toolkit that unifies system dynamics, constraints, and objectives into a
modular, user-friendly, and efficient optimization structure. Our approach
natively supports manifold-valued states with Gaussian uncertainties modeled in
tangent spaces. By exploiting the sparsity and probabilistic structure of
factor graphs, the toolkit achieves real-time performance even for
high-dimensional systems with complex constraints. The velocity-extended
on-manifold control barrier function (CBF)-based obstacle avoidance factors are
designed for safety-critical applications. By bridging graphical models with
safety-critical MPC, our work offers a scalable and geometrically consistent
framework for integrated planning and control. The simulations and experimental
results on the quadrotor demonstrate superior trajectory tracking and obstacle
avoidance performance compared to baseline methods. To foster research
reproducibility, we have provided open-source implementation offering
plug-and-play factors.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于质心稳定性的重定向方法有效提高了人形机器人在复杂遥操作任务中的稳定性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Teleoperation is a powerful method to generate reference motions and enable
humanoid robots to perform a broad range of tasks. However, teleoperation
becomes challenging when using hand contacts and non-coplanar surfaces, often
leading to motor torque saturation or loss of stability through slipping. We
propose a centroidal stability-based retargeting method that dynamically
adjusts contact points and posture during teleoperation to enhance stability in
these difficult scenarios. Central to our approach is an efficient analytical
calculation of the stability margin gradient. This gradient is used to identify
scenarios for which stability is highly sensitive to teleoperation setpoints
and inform the local adjustment of these setpoints. We validate the framework
in simulation and hardware by teleoperating manipulation tasks on a humanoid,
demonstrating increased stability margins. We also demonstrate empirically that
higher stability margins correlate with improved impulse resilience and joint
torque margin.

Abstract: Rapid progress in imitation learning, foundation models, and large-scale
datasets has led to robot manipulation policies that generalize to a wide-range
of tasks and environments. However, rigorous evaluation of these policies
remains a challenge. Typically in practice, robot policies are often evaluated
on a small number of hardware trials without any statistical assurances. We
present SureSim, a framework to augment large-scale simulation with relatively
small-scale real-world testing to provide reliable inferences on the real-world
performance of a policy. Our key idea is to formalize the problem of combining
real and simulation evaluations as a prediction-powered inference problem, in
which a small number of paired real and simulation evaluations are used to
rectify bias in large-scale simulation. We then leverage non-asymptotic mean
estimation algorithms to provide confidence intervals on mean policy
performance. Using physics-based simulation, we evaluate both diffusion policy
and multi-task fine-tuned \(\pi_0\) on a joint distribution of objects and
initial conditions, and find that our approach saves over \(20-25\%\) of
hardware evaluation effort to achieve similar bounds on policy performance.

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have gained popularity and attention in trajectory
optimization due to their capability of modeling multi-modal probability
distributions. However, addressing nonlinear equality constraints, i.e, dynamic
feasi- bility, remains a great challenge in diffusion-based trajectory
optimization. Recent diffusion-based trajectory optimization frameworks rely on
a single-shooting style approach where the denoised control sequence is applied
to forward propagate the dynamical system, which cannot explicitly enforce
constraints on the states and frequently leads to sub-optimal solutions. In
this work, we propose a novel direct trajectory optimization approach via
model-based diffusion, which directly generates a sequence of states. To ensure
dynamic feasibility, we propose a gradient-free projection mechanism that is
incorporated into the reverse diffusion process. Our results show that,
compared to a recent state-of-the-art baseline, our approach leads to zero
dynamic feasibility error and approximately 4x higher success rate in a
quadrotor waypoint navigation scenario involving dense static obstacles.

Abstract: Data-driven control methods such as data-enabled predictive control (DeePC)
have shown strong potential in efficient control of soft robots without

paper, we present a novel velocity-form DeePC framework that achieves robust
and optimal control of soft robots under unknown payloads. The proposed
framework leverages input-output data in an incremental representation to
mitigate performance degradation induced by unknown payloads, eliminating the
need for weighted datasets or disturbance estimators. We validate the method
experimentally on a planar soft robot and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to standard DeePC in scenarios involving unknown payloads.

Abstract: Grasping objects across vastly different sizes and physical states-including
both solids and liquids-with a single robotic gripper remains a fundamental
challenge in soft robotics. We present the Everything-Grasping (EG) Gripper, a
soft end-effector that synergistically integrates distributed surface suction
with internal granular jamming, enabling cross-scale and cross-state
manipulation without requiring airtight sealing at the contact interface with
target objects. The EG Gripper can handle objects with surface areas ranging
from sub-millimeter scale 0.2 mm2 (glass bead) to over 62,000 mm2 (A4 sized
paper and woven bag), enabling manipulation of objects nearly 3,500X smaller
and 88X larger than its own contact area (approximated at 707 mm2 for a 30
mm-diameter base). We further introduce a tactile sensing framework that
combines liquid detection and pressure-based suction feedback, enabling
real-time differentiation between solid and liquid targets. Guided by the
actile-Inferred Grasping Mode Selection (TIGMS) algorithm, the gripper
autonomously selects grasping modes based on distributed pressure and voltage
signals. Experiments across diverse tasks-including underwater grasping,
fragile object handling, and liquid capture-demonstrate robust and repeatable
performance. To our knowledge, this is the first soft gripper to reliably grasp
both solid and liquid objects across scales using a unified compliant
architecture.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics have been largely driven by imitation learning,
which depends critically on large-scale, high-quality demonstration data.
However, collecting such data remains a significant challenge-particularly for
mobile manipulators, which must coordinate base locomotion and arm manipulation
in high-dimensional, dynamic, and partially observable environments.
Consequently, most existing research remains focused on simpler tabletop
scenarios, leaving mobile manipulation relatively underexplored. To bridge this
gap, we present \textit{MobRT}, a digital twin-based framework designed to
simulate two primary categories of complex, whole-body tasks: interaction with
articulated objects (e.g., opening doors and drawers) and mobile-base
pick-and-place operations. \textit{MobRT} autonomously generates diverse and
realistic demonstrations through the integration of virtual kinematic control
and whole-body motion planning, enabling coherent and physically consistent
execution. We evaluate the quality of \textit{MobRT}-generated data across
multiple baseline algorithms, establishing a comprehensive benchmark and
demonstrating a strong correlation between task success and the number of
generated trajectories. Experiments integrating both simulated and real-world
demonstrations confirm that our approach markedly improves policy
generalization and performance, achieving robust results in both simulated and
real-world environments.

Abstract: To empower mobile robots with usable maps as well as highest state estimation
accuracy and robustness, we present OKVIS2-X: a state-of-the-art multi-sensor
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system building dense volumetric
occupancy maps, while scalable to large environments and operating in realtime.
Our unified SLAM framework seamlessly integrates different sensor modalities:
visual, inertial, measured or learned depth, LiDAR and Global Navigation
Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. Unlike most state-of-the-art SLAM
systems, we advocate using dense volumetric map representations when leveraging
depth or range-sensing capabilities. We employ an efficient submapping strategy
that allows our system to scale to large environments, showcased in sequences
of up to 9 kilometers. OKVIS2-X enhances its accuracy and robustness by
tightly-coupling the estimator and submaps through map alignment factors. Our
system provides globally consistent maps, directly usable for autonomous
navigation. To further improve the accuracy of OKVIS2-X, we also incorporate
the option of performing online calibration of camera extrinsics. Our system
achieves the highest trajectory accuracy in EuRoC against state-of-the-art
alternatives, outperforms all competitors in the Hilti22 VI-only benchmark,
while also proving competitive in the LiDAR version, and showcases state of the
art accuracy in the diverse and large-scale sequences from the VBR dataset.

Abstract: Biomimetic intelligence and robotics are transforming field ecology by
enabling lifelike robotic surrogates that interact naturally with animals under
real world conditions. Studying avian behavior in the wild remains challenging
due to the need for highly realistic morphology, durable outdoor operation, and
intelligent perception that can adapt to uncontrolled environments. We present
a next generation bio inspired robotic platform that replicates the morphology
and visual appearance of the female Houbara bustard to support controlled
ethological studies and conservation oriented field research. The system
introduces a fully digitally replicable fabrication workflow that combines high
resolution structured light 3D scanning, parametric CAD modelling, articulated
3D printing, and photorealistic UV textured vinyl finishing to achieve
anatomically accurate and durable robotic surrogates. A six wheeled rocker
bogie chassis ensures stable mobility on sand and irregular terrain, while an
embedded NVIDIA Jetson module enables real time RGB and thermal perception,
lightweight YOLO based detection, and an autonomous visual servoing loop that
aligns the robot's head toward detected targets without human intervention. A
lightweight thermal visible fusion module enhances perception in low light
conditions. Field trials in desert aviaries demonstrated reliable real time
operation at 15 to 22 FPS with latency under 100 ms and confirmed that the
platform elicits natural recognition and interactive responses from live
Houbara bustards under harsh outdoor conditions. This integrated framework
advances biomimetic field robotics by uniting reproducible digital fabrication,
embodied visual intelligence, and ecological validation, providing a
transferable blueprint for animal robot interaction research, conservation
robotics, and public engagement.

*Alexander L. Mitchell,Joe Watson,Ingmar Posner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度的分散式框架，使用自适应势函数的自动组合来生成分段连续能量函数，解决双臂装配中的快速重规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双臂装配面临高层序列规划、多机器人协调和接触丰富的操作等挑战。传统任务和运动规划方法在需要新任务序列时收敛缓慢，特别是在公差装配中，摩擦和变形等难以建模的动态特性需要快速重规划。

Method: 使用自适应势函数的自动组合构建分段连续能量函数，通过近视优化而非长视距规划生成子目标，实现分散式梯度优化。

Result: 该方法能够扩展到物理双臂装配任务，构建公差装配件，并自动产生重试、协调运动和自主交接等行为。

Conclusion: 梯度快速重规划框架能够以涌现方式生成自动重试、协调运动和自主交接，有效解决长视距任务。

Abstract: There are many challenges in bimanual assembly, including high-level
sequencing, multi-robot coordination, and low-level, contact-rich operations
such as component mating. Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods, while
effective in this domain, may be prohibitively slow to converge when adapting
to disturbances that require new task sequencing and optimisation. These events
are common during tight-tolerance assembly, where difficult-to-model dynamics
such as friction or deformation require rapid replanning and reattempts.
Moreover, defining explicit task sequences for assembly can be cumbersome,
limiting flexibility when task replanning is required. To simplify this
planning, we introduce a decentralised gradient-based framework that uses a
piecewise continuous energy function through the automatic composition of
adaptive potential functions. This approach generates sub-goals using only
myopic optimisation, rather than long-horizon planning. It demonstrates
effectiveness at solving long-horizon tasks due to the structure and adaptivity
of the energy function. We show that our approach scales to physical bimanual
assembly tasks for constructing tight-tolerance assemblies. In these
experiments, we discover that our gradient-based rapid replanning framework
generates automatic retries, coordinated motions and autonomous handovers in an
emergent fashion.

Abstract: This paper introduces a methodology for task-specific design optimization of
multirotor Micro Aerial Vehicles. By leveraging reinforcement learning,
Bayesian optimization, and covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy, we
optimize aerial robot designs guided exclusively by their closed-loop
performance in a considered task. Our approach systematically explores the
design space of motor pose configurations while ensuring manufacturability
constraints and minimal aerodynamic interference. Results demonstrate that
optimized designs achieve superior performance compared to conventional
multirotor configurations in agile waypoint navigation tasks, including against
fully actuated designs from the literature. We build and test one of the
optimized designs in the real world to validate the sim2real transferability of
our approach.

*Shuo Sha,Anupam Bhakta,Zhenyuan Jiang,Kevin Qiu,Ishaan Mahajan,Gabriel Bravo,Brian Plancher*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TAG-K是一种轻量级的Kaczmarz方法扩展，结合贪心随机行选择和尾部平均，用于机器人惯性参数在线估计，在计算效率和估计精度上优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统在线惯性参数估计方法（如RLS和KF）难以跟踪参数突变或计算成本高，限制了在动态环境和计算受限机器人系统中的有效性。

Method: TAG-K结合贪心随机行选择实现快速收敛，使用尾部平均在噪声和不一致情况下保持鲁棒性，同时保持Kaczmarz框架的低迭代复杂度。

Result: 在合成基准测试和四旋翼跟踪任务中，TAG-K在笔记本电脑CPU上实现1.5x-1.9x更快的求解时间，在嵌入式微控制器上实现4.8x-20.7x更快的求解时间，估计误差降低25%，端到端跟踪性能提升近2倍。

Conclusion: TAG-K在保持低计算复杂度的同时，显著提升了参数估计的速度、鲁棒性和精度，适用于动态环境和计算受限的机器人系统。

Abstract: Accurate online inertial parameter estimation is essential for adaptive
robotic control, enabling real-time adjustment to payload changes,
environmental interactions, and system wear. Traditional methods such as
Recursive Least Squares (RLS) and the Kalman Filter (KF) often struggle to
track abrupt parameter shifts or incur high computational costs, limiting their
effectiveness in dynamic environments and for computationally constrained
robotic systems. As such, we introduce TAG-K, a lightweight extension of the
Kaczmarz method that combines greedy randomized row selection for rapid
convergence with tail averaging for robustness under noise and inconsistency.
This design enables fast, stable parameter adaptation while retaining the low
per-iteration complexity inherent to the Kaczmarz framework. We evaluate TAG-K
in synthetic benchmarks and quadrotor tracking tasks against RLS, KF, and other
Kaczmarz variants. TAG-K achieves 1.5x-1.9x faster solve times on laptop-class
CPUs and 4.8x-20.7x faster solve times on embedded microcontrollers. More
importantly, these speedups are paired with improved resilience to measurement
noise and a 25% reduction in estimation error, leading to nearly 2x better
end-to-end tracking performance.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for enabling robust robotic perception
in dark environments using infrared (IR) stream. IR stream is less susceptible
to noise than RGB in low-light conditions. However, it is dominated by active
emitter patterns that hinder high-level tasks such as object detection,
tracking and localisation. To address this, a U-Net-based architecture is
proposed that reconstructs clean IR images from emitter-populated input,
improving both image quality and downstream robotic performance. This approach
outperforms existing enhancement techniques and enables reliable operation of
vision-driven robotic systems across illumination conditions from well-lit to
extreme low-light scenes.

TL;DR: HyperVLA是一种基于超网络的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过激活小型任务特定策略来大幅降低推理成本，同时保持多任务学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型虽然具有强大的泛化能力，但推理成本极高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用超网络架构，在推理时只激活小型任务特定策略，同时设计了利用视觉基础模型先验知识、超网络归一化和动作生成策略等关键技术。

Result: 与OpenVLA相比，激活参数减少90倍，推理速度提升120倍，在零样本泛化和少样本适应方面达到相似或更高的成功率。

Conclusion: HyperVLA在保持高性能的同时显著降低了推理成本，为通用机器人策略的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Built upon language and vision foundation models with strong generalization
ability and trained on large-scale robotic data, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models have recently emerged as a promising approach to learning generalist
robotic policies. However, a key drawback of existing VLAs is their extremely
high inference costs. In this paper, we propose HyperVLA to address this
problem. Unlike existing monolithic VLAs that activate the whole model during
both training and inference, HyperVLA uses a novel hypernetwork (HN)-based
architecture that activates only a small task-specific policy during inference,
while still retaining the high model capacity needed to accommodate diverse
multi-task behaviors during training. Successfully training an HN-based VLA is
nontrivial so HyperVLA contains several key algorithm design features that
improve its performance, including properly utilizing the prior knowledge from
existing vision foundation models, HN normalization, and an action generation
strategy. Compared to monolithic VLAs, HyperVLA achieves a similar or even
higher success rate for both zero-shot generalization and few-shot adaptation,
while significantly reducing inference costs. Compared to OpenVLA, a
state-of-the-art VLA model, HyperVLA reduces the number of activated parameters
at test time by $90\times$, and accelerates inference speed by $120\times$.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用视觉语言模型进行高层规划的新框架，通过零样本推理占用地图来选择更有效的子目标，提高室内未知环境中的自主导航效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统探索方法由于全局推理能力有限且依赖局部启发式，在存在许多死胡同的未知室内环境中往往采取低效路径。

Method: 将3D占用网格转换为部分2D地图，生成候选子目标，由VLM模型评估和排序子目标，并与DYNUS轨迹规划器集成。

Result: 在仿真中展示了改进的导航效率，VLM能够从不完整地图推断结构模式（如房间、走廊），平衡向目标前进与进入未知空间的风险，减少了常见贪婪失败。

Conclusion: 该方法平均缩短约10%的路径长度，有效改善了未知室内环境中的导航效率。

Abstract: We present a novel high-level planning framework that leverages
vision-language models (VLMs) to improve autonomous navigation in unknown
indoor environments with many dead ends. Traditional exploration methods often
take inefficient routes due to limited global reasoning and reliance on local
heuristics. In contrast, our approach enables a VLM to reason directly about an
occupancy map in a zero-shot manner, selecting subgoals that are likely to lead
to more efficient paths. At each planning step, we convert a 3D occupancy grid
into a partial 2D map of the environment, and generate candidate subgoals. Each
subgoal is then evaluated and ranked against other candidates by the model. We
integrate this planning scheme into DYNUS \cite{kondo2025dynus}, a
state-of-the-art trajectory planner, and demonstrate improved navigation
efficiency in simulation. The VLM infers structural patterns (e.g., rooms,
corridors) from incomplete maps and balances the need to make progress toward a
goal against the risk of entering unknown space. This reduces common greedy
failures (e.g., detouring into small rooms) and achieves about 10\% shorter
paths on average.

Motivation: 传统机器人运动研究多受生物启发，但许多工程场景可从非仿生形态中受益。研究旨在探索电影《星际穿越》中TARS机器人的非仿生形态在现实机器人运动中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: TARS3D的虚构启发非仿生形态能实现多种未探索的运动模式，解析合成与强化学习的结合为多模态机器人开辟了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Robotic locomotion research typically draws from biologically inspired leg
designs, yet many human-engineered settings can benefit from
non-anthropomorphic forms. TARS3D translates the block-shaped 'TARS' robot from
Interstellar into a 0.25 m, 0.99 kg research platform with seven actuated
degrees of freedom. The film shows two primary gaits: a bipedal-like walk and a
high-speed rolling mode. For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each,
derive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on
hardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip
limits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an
eight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg
provides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke
double rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far
richer gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we
used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored
space. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under
the right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that
TARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple
previously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search
is likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and
reinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在具身智能中难以平衡表达性和紧凑性，导致状态表示要么冗余要么缺乏关键任务信息。

Method: 使用轻量级编码器和预训练DiT解码器学习压缩的双令牌状态表示，通过潜在插值获得潜在动作。

Result: 在LIBERO上性能提升14.3%，真实世界任务成功率提升30%，潜在动作增强策略协同训练，优于先前方法10.4%。

Conclusion: StaMo方法从静态图像学习紧凑状态表示，无需复杂架构或视频数据，就能产生有效的潜在动作，具有良好的可扩展性和可解释性。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in embodied intelligence is developing expressive and
compact state representations for efficient world modeling and decision making.
However, existing methods often fail to achieve this balance, yielding
representations that are either overly redundant or lacking in task-critical
information. We propose an unsupervised approach that learns a highly
compressed two-token state representation using a lightweight encoder and a
pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder, capitalizing on its strong
generative prior. Our representation is efficient, interpretable, and
integrates seamlessly into existing VLA-based models, improving performance by
14.3% on LIBERO and 30% in real-world task success with minimal inference
overhead. More importantly, we find that the difference between these tokens,
obtained via latent interpolation, naturally serves as a highly effective
latent action, which can be further decoded into executable robot actions. This
emergent capability reveals that our representation captures structured
dynamics without explicit supervision. We name our method StaMo for its ability
to learn generalizable robotic Motion from compact State representation, which
is encoded from static images, challenging the prevalent dependence to learning
latent action on complex architectures and video data. The resulting latent
actions also enhance policy co-training, outperforming prior methods by 10.4%
with improved interpretability. Moreover, our approach scales effectively
across diverse data sources, including real-world robot data, simulation, and
human egocentric video.

Result: 在连续控制任务中优于现有方法，包括先前方法无法满足目标达成或安全约束的情况，并在6自由度机械臂的真实世界任务中验证了有效性

Conclusion: ACQL是根据丰富时序规范学习机器人行为的鲁棒且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Real-world robotic tasks often require agents to achieve sequences of goals
while respecting time-varying safety constraints. However, standard
Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms are fundamentally limited in these
settings. A natural approach to these problems is to combine RL with
Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL), a formal language for specifying complex,
temporally extended tasks and safety constraints. Yet, existing RL methods for
LTL objectives exhibit poor empirical performance in complex and continuous
environments. As a result, no scalable methods support both temporally ordered
goals and safety simultaneously, making them ill-suited for realistic robotics
scenarios. We propose Automaton Constrained Q-Learning (ACQL), an algorithm
that addresses this gap by combining goal-conditioned value learning with
automaton-guided reinforcement. ACQL supports most LTL task specifications and
leverages their automaton representation to explicitly encode stage-wise goal
progression and both stationary and non-stationary safety constraints. We show
that ACQL outperforms existing methods across a range of continuous control
tasks, including cases where prior methods fail to satisfy either goal-reaching
or safety constraints. We further validate its real-world applicability by
deploying ACQL on a 6-DOF robotic arm performing a goal-reaching task in a
cluttered, cabinet-like space with safety constraints. Our results demonstrate
that ACQL is a robust and scalable solution for learning robotic behaviors
according to rich temporal specifications.

Conclusion: ResMimic框架成功实现了人形机器人精确的全身运动与操作控制，为日常服务和仓储任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body loco-manipulation promises transformative capabilities
for daily service and warehouse tasks. While recent advances in general motion
tracking (GMT) have enabled humanoids to reproduce diverse human motions, these
policies lack the precision and object awareness required for
loco-manipulation. To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual
learning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human
motion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion,
serves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements.
An efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT
outputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further
facilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object
tracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that
encourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a
curriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training. We
evaluate ResMimic in both simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Results
show substantial gains in task success, training efficiency, and robustness
over strong baselines. Videos are available at https://resmimic.github.io/ .

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的脉冲感知数据剪枝方法SADP，通过基于梯度范数的选择概率来减少梯度方差，显著加速SNN训练，在ImageNet上减少35%训练时间的同时保持准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN作为传统ANN的节能替代方案，随着模型和数据集的扩展，训练开销巨大，限制了计算资源有限的研究者使用和SNN的持续发展。数据剪枝是加速训练的有前景策略，但在SNN中尚未充分探索。

Method: SADP方法通过确定每个样本的选择概率与梯度范数成比例来减少梯度方差，避免直接计算梯度的高成本，使用高效的脉冲感知重要性分数上界，该分数考虑了全或无脉冲对梯度范数的影响。

Result: 在多种数据集和架构上的实验表明，SADP始终优于数据剪枝基线，在不同剪枝比例下实现接近理论最大值的训练加速。在ImageNet上减少35%训练时间，同时保持与全数据训练相当的准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作为高效SNN训练建立了以数据为中心的范式，为将SNN扩展到更大模型和数据集铺平了道路。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs), recognized as an energy-efficient alternative
to traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), have advanced rapidly through
the scaling of models and datasets. However, such scaling incurs considerable
training overhead, posing challenges for researchers with limited computational
resources and hindering the sustained development of SNNs. Data pruning is a
promising strategy for accelerating training by retaining the most informative
examples and discarding redundant ones, but it remains largely unexplored in
SNNs. Directly applying ANN-based data pruning methods to SNNs fails to capture
the intrinsic importance of examples and suffers from high gradient variance.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel spike-aware data pruning (SADP)
method. SADP reduces gradient variance by determining each example's selection
probability to be proportional to its gradient norm, while avoiding the high
cost of direct gradient computation through an efficient upper bound, termed
spike-aware importance score. This score accounts for the influence of
all-or-nothing spikes on the gradient norm and can be computed with negligible
overhead. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and architectures
demonstrate that SADP consistently outperforms data pruning baselines and
achieves training speedups close to the theoretical maxima at different pruning
ratios. Notably, SADP reduces training time by 35% on ImageNet while
maintaining accuracy comparable to that of full-data training. This work,
therefore, establishes a data-centric paradigm for efficient SNN training and
paves the way for scaling SNNs to larger models and datasets. The source code
will be released publicly after the review process.

TL;DR: SpikingMamba是一种基于脉冲神经网络的节能大语言模型，通过知识蒸馏从Mamba模型获得，在保持高能效的同时最小化精度损失。


<details>

Motivation: 解决大语言模型能耗高的问题，传统SNN方法在能效和性能之间存在权衡，且全预训练成本高昂不实用。

Method: 采用TI-LIF三元整数脉冲神经元保持语义极性，使用训练专用的平滑梯度补偿路径减少量化损失，通过单阶段知识蒸馏和强化学习增强零样本能力。

Conclusion: SpikingMamba成功实现了能效与性能的良好平衡，为在边缘设备上部署高效大语言模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
tasks but remain energy-intensive due to dense matrix operations. Spiking
neural networks (SNNs) improve energy efficiency by replacing dense matrix
multiplications with sparse accumulations. Their sparse spike activity enables
efficient LLMs deployment on edge devices. However, prior SNN-based LLMs often
sacrifice performance for efficiency, and recovering accuracy typically
requires full pretraining, which is costly and impractical. To address this, we
propose SpikingMamba, an energy-efficient SNN-based LLMs distilled from Mamba
that improves energy efficiency with minimal accuracy sacrifice. SpikingMamba
integrates two key components: (a) TI-LIF, a ternary-integer spiking neuron
that preserves semantic polarity through signed multi-level spike
representations. (b) A training-exclusive Smoothed Gradient Compensation (SGC)
path mitigating quantization loss while preserving spike-driven efficiency. We
employ a single-stage distillation strategy to transfer the zero-shot ability
of pretrained Mamba and further enhance it via reinforcement learning (RL).
Experiments show that SpikingMamba-1.3B achieves a 4.76$\times$ energy benefit,
with only a 4.78\% zero-shot accuracy gap compared to the original Mamba, and
achieves a further 2.55\% accuracy improvement after RL.

TL;DR: 该论文综述了从静息态和睡眠EEG数据中可以检测到的个人健康信息隐私风险，发现即使短时EEG数据也能高精度分类多种疾病，强调了EEG数据匿名化的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无任务EEG数据中可检测的个人健康信息类型，评估公开EEG数据的隐私风险，为保护研究参与者和医疗EEG用户的隐私提供依据。

Method: 通过Google Scholar、Web of Science和相关期刊搜索，筛选关于在静息态和睡眠EEG中分类医疗障碍的英文同行评审研究，由3名评审员进行质量分析。

Result: 静息态EEG仅需5分钟或更短数据即可高精度分类自闭症谱系障碍、帕金森病、酒精使用障碍等；睡眠EEG可分类睡眠呼吸暂停、失眠、REM睡眠障碍等，但通常需要更长时间记录或多睡眠阶段数据。

Conclusion: EEG数据能够揭示敏感个人健康信息，随着机器学习方法从EEG数据中重新识别个体的能力增强，需要加强匿名化和开发改进工具来保护参与者隐私。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram monitoring devices and online data repositories hold
large amounts of data from individuals participating in research and medical
studies without direct reference to personal identifiers. This paper explores
what types of personal and health information have been detected and classified
within task-free EEG data. Additionally, we investigate key characteristics of
the collected resting-state and sleep data, in order to determine the privacy
risks involved with openly available EEG data. We used Google Scholar, Web of
Science and searched relevant journals to find studies which classified or
detected the presence of various disorders and personal information in resting
state and sleep EEG. Only English full-text peer-reviewed journal articles or
conference papers about classifying the presence of medical disorders between
individuals were included. A quality analysis carried out by 3 reviewers
determined general paper quality based on specified evaluation criteria. In
resting state EEG, various disorders including Autism Spectrum Disorder,
Parkinson's disease, and alcohol use disorder have been classified with high
classification accuracy, often requiring only 5 mins of data or less. Sleep EEG
tends to hold classifiable information about sleep disorders such as sleep
apnea, insomnia, and REM sleep disorder, but usually involve longer recordings
or data from multiple sleep stages. Many classification methods are still
developing but even today, access to a person's EEG can reveal sensitive
personal health information. With an increasing ability of machine learning
methods to re-identify individuals from their EEG data, this review
demonstrates the importance of anonymization, and the development of improved
tools for keeping study participants and medical EEG users' privacy safe.

Motivation: 为元启发式算法在组合优化问题中的应用提供一个系统化的框架，以更可靠地评估算法性能并量化找到全局最优解的概率。

Method: 三阶段框架：1）参数空间的广泛探索；2）高性能参数的利用；3）不确定性量化评估结果可靠性。以ACO求解TSPLIB berlin52数据集为例。

Result: 计算得出ACO在单次运行中找到全局最优解（7542）的概率约为1/40，在10次运行中聚合概率提升至1/5。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效评估元启发式算法的性能，并为算法找到全局最优解的概率提供量化依据，提高了结果的可信度。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for applying metaheuristic algorithms, such as ant
colony optimization (ACO), to combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) like
the traveling salesman problem (TSP). The framework consists of three
sequential stages: broad exploration of the parameter space, exploitation of
top-performing parameters, and uncertainty quantification (UQ) to assess the
reliability of results. As a case study, we apply ACO to the TSPLIB berlin52
dataset, which has a known optimal tour length of 7542. Using our framework, we
calculate that the probability of ACO finding the global optimum is
approximately 1/40 in a single run and improves to 1/5 when aggregated over ten
runs.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个机器学习框架，利用语音的声学和语言特征来检测阿尔茨海默病和轻度认知障碍，在PROCESS挑战赛中取得了良好表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前阿尔茨海默病和轻度认知障碍的诊断方法资源密集且具有侵入性，而语音作为非侵入性生物标志物具有巨大潜力。

Method: 使用Whisper嵌入提取音频特征，从转录文本中提取语言特征（代词使用、句法复杂性、填充词等），构建分类模型区分健康对照组、轻度认知障碍和阿尔茨海默病患者，回归模型预测MMSE分数。

Result: 基于语言特征的投票集成模型在分类任务中表现最佳（F1=0.497），基于Whisper嵌入的集成回归器在MMSE预测中误差最低（RMSE=2.843），在PROCESS挑战赛中回归任务排名靠前。

Conclusion: 多模态语音方法在认知评估中具有潜力，整合任务特定的语言和声学标记对痴呆检测很重要。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment
(MCI) is critical for timely intervention, yet current diagnostic approaches
remain resource-intensive and invasive. Speech, encompassing both acoustic and
linguistic dimensions, offers a promising non-invasive biomarker for cognitive
decline. In this study, we present a machine learning framework for the PROCESS
Challenge, leveraging both audio embeddings and linguistic features derived
from spontaneous speech recordings. Audio representations were extracted using
Whisper embeddings from the Cookie Theft description task, while linguistic
features-spanning pronoun usage, syntactic complexity, filler words, and clause
structure-were obtained from transcriptions across Semantic Fluency, Phonemic
Fluency, and Cookie Theft picture description. Classification models aimed to
distinguish between Healthy Controls (HC), MCI, and AD participants, while
regression models predicted Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores.
Results demonstrated that voted ensemble models trained on concatenated
linguistic features achieved the best classification performance (F1 = 0.497),
while Whisper embedding-based ensemble regressors yielded the lowest MMSE
prediction error (RMSE = 2.843). Comparative evaluation within the PROCESS
Challenge placed our models among the top submissions in regression task, and
mid-range for classification, highlighting the complementary strengths of
linguistic and audio embeddings. These findings reinforce the potential of
multimodal speech-based approaches for scalable, non-invasive cognitive
assessment and underline the importance of integrating task-specific linguistic
and acoustic markers in dementia detection.

this paper, we introduce the SAFE (Synthetic Audio Forensics Evaluation)
Challenge, a fully blind evaluation framework designed to benchmark detection

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上的声学场景分类模型通常基于固定类别假设，缺乏现实应用所需的可迁移性，无法适应新的或细化的声学类别。

Method: 结合监督对比微调预训练模型和对比表示蒸馏，构建保持场景间语义关系的嵌入空间，将结构化知识转移到紧凑的学生模型中。

Result: 评估显示ContrastASC在保持强闭集性能的同时，对未见类别的少样本适应能力得到改善。

Conclusion: 该方法能够学习可泛化的声学场景表示，实现对新类别的适应性，同时保持模型紧凑性。

Abstract: Acoustic scene classification (ASC) models on edge devices typically operate
under fixed class assumptions, lacking the transferability needed for
real-world applications that require adaptation to new or refined acoustic
categories. We propose ContrastASC, which learns generalizable acoustic scene
representations by structuring the embedding space to preserve semantic
relationships between scenes, enabling adaptation to unseen categories without
retraining. Our approach combines supervised contrastive fine-tuning of
pre-trained models with contrastive representation distillation to transfer
this structured knowledge to compact student models. Our evaluation shows that
ContrastASC demonstrates improved few-shot adaptation to unseen categories
while maintaining strong closed-set performance.

Abstract: In neural-based audio feature extraction, ensuring that representations

However, existing disentanglement methods often rely on assumptions that are
highly dependent on data characteristics or specific tasks. In this work, we
introduce a generalizable approach for learning disentangled features within a

Motivation: 虽然基于神经网络的模型在音频特征提取方面取得了显著进展，但学习到的表示的可解释性仍然是一个关键挑战。现有的分离技术在离散神经音频编解码器中施加结构，但这些方法通常对特定数据集或任务制定有很强的依赖性。

Method: 利用时域信号的频谱分解来构建分离式神经音频编解码器，通过频谱分解增强表示的可解释性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于频谱分解的分离式神经音频编解码器能够有效提高音频表示的可解释性，同时在性能上优于现有方法。

Abstract: While neural-based models have led to significant advancements in audio
feature extraction, the interpretability of the learned representations remains
a critical challenge. To address this, disentanglement techniques have been
integrated into discrete neural audio codecs to impose structure on the

on specific datasets or task formulations. In this work, we propose a
disentangled neural audio codec that leverages spectral decomposition of
time-domain signals to enhance representation interpretability. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that our method surpasses a state-of-the-art baseline
in both reconstruction fidelity and perceptual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法直接将带噪语音映射到干净语音，缺乏对噪声分布的显式建模，限制了在未知噪声条件下的泛化能力。

Method: 使用轻量级辅助模型估计噪声分布，通过引导机制将其整合到扩散去噪过程中，利用预训练的大规模DDPM进行语音增强。

Result: 在LibriSpeech语音添加BBC音效库噪声的测试中，相比最先进基线方法，在不匹配噪声条件下获得持续改进。

Conclusion: GDiffuSE通过显式噪声建模和引导机制，提高了语音增强系统在未知噪声条件下的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel speech enhancement (SE) approach based on a
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), termed Guided diffusion for
speech enhancement (GDiffuSE). In contrast to conventional methods that
directly map noisy speech to clean speech, our method employs a lightweight
helper model to estimate the noise distribution, which is then incorporated
into the diffusion denoising process via a guidance mechanism. This design
improves robustness by enabling seamless adaptation to unseen noise types and
by leveraging large-scale DDPMs originally trained for speech generation in the
context of SE. We evaluate our approach on noisy signals obtained by adding
noise samples from the BBC sound effects database to LibriSpeech utterances,
showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines under
mismatched noise conditions. Examples are available at our project webpage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音数据包含丰富的敏感信息，用户可能因隐私问题要求删除部分数据。现有机器遗忘方法依赖待遗忘样本之外的数据，这在数据重分发受限和大数据场景下面临挑战。

Method: 使用对抗攻击方法，仅利用待遗忘数据对预训练的语音情感识别模型进行微调，实现知识遗忘。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效移除模型中的待遗忘数据知识，同时在情感识别测试集上保持较高的模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出的对抗攻击方法为语音情感识别中的隐私保护提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在仅使用待遗忘数据的情况下实现模型知识遗忘。

Abstract: Speech emotion recognition aims to identify emotional states from speech
signals and has been widely applied in human-computer interaction, education,
healthcare, and many other fields. However, since speech data contain rich
sensitive information, partial data can be required to be deleted by speakers
due to privacy concerns. Current machine unlearning approaches largely depend
on data beyond the samples to be forgotten. However, this reliance poses
challenges when data redistribution is restricted and demands substantial
computational resources in the context of big data. We propose a novel
adversarial-attack-based approach that fine-tunes a pre-trained speech emotion
recognition model using only the data to be forgotten. The experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed approach can effectively remove the knowledge of
the data to be forgotten from the model, while preserving high model
performance on the test set for emotion recognition.

Motivation: 现有方法虽然能实现音乐制作所需的质量，但通常依赖高维潜在表示，这些表示难以导航且用户体验不直观。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式：首先使用变分自编码器训练音高-音色解耦的2D音频表示；然后将该表示作为基于Transformer的生成模型的调节输入。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法有效学习了音色解耦空间，实现了表达性和可控的音频生成，同时保持高音高准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直观的2D潜在空间界面，为未来既直观又富有创造力的音乐制作环境迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to neural instrument sound synthesis
using a two-stage semi-supervised learning framework capable of generating
pitch-accurate, high-quality music samples from an expressive timbre latent
space. Existing approaches that achieve sufficient quality for music production
often rely on high-dimensional latent representations that are difficult to
navigate and provide unintuitive user experiences. We address this limitation
through a two-stage training paradigm: first, we train a pitch-timbre
disentangled 2D representation of audio samples using a Variational
Autoencoder; second, we use this representation as conditioning input for a
Transformer-based generative model. The learned 2D latent space serves as an
intuitive interface for navigating and exploring the sound landscape. We
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively learns a disentangled timbre
space, enabling expressive and controllable audio generation with reliable
pitch conditioning. Experimental results show the model's ability to capture
subtle variations in timbre while maintaining a high degree of pitch accuracy.
The usability of our method is demonstrated in an interactive web application,
highlighting its potential as a step towards future music production
environments that are both intuitive and creatively empowering:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习虽然能低成本学习丰富表示，但评估下游任务性能成本高昂，现有方法仍需额外训练或超参数调优。

Method: 将SSL模型生成的离散token序列和最小域线索输入LLMs，利用上下文学习获得均值对数似然作为评估指标。

Result: 实验显示LLM评分与自动语音识别任务性能相关，且LLM还能提供用于说话人验证任务的推理时嵌入。

Conclusion: LLMs不仅能作为SSL评估工具，还能提供有用的推理时嵌入，为SSL模型评估提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has gained traction for its ability to learn
rich representations with low labeling costs, applicable across diverse
downstream tasks. However, assessing the downstream-task performance remains
challenging due to the cost of extra training and evaluation. Existing methods
for task-agnostic evaluation also require extra training or hyperparameter
tuning. We propose a novel evaluation metric using large language models
(LLMs). By inputting discrete token sequences and minimal domain cues derived
from SSL models into LLMs, we obtain the mean log-likelihood; these cues guide
in-context learning, rendering the score more reliable without extra training
or hyperparameter tuning. Experimental results show a correlation between
LLM-based scores and automatic speech recognition task. Additionally, our
findings reveal that LLMs not only functions as an SSL evaluation tools but
also provides inference-time embeddings that are useful for speaker
verification task.

TL;DR: Siren是一个基于语言模型的文本到音频生成框架，通过多隔离变压器和强化学习解决了残差向量量化(RVQ)在音频生成中的关键困境，超越了现有LM和扩散模型，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于语言模型和RVQ的文本到音频生成系统在音频保真度方面仍落后于扩散模型，主要原因是更多RVQ层虽然提高重建质量但超出传统LM的生成能力，存在正交特征和语义衰减问题。

Method: 提出Siren框架：1)分析RVQ动态发现正交特征和语义衰减问题；2)使用多个隔离变压器进行因果条件化；3)通过强化学习进行反因果对齐。

Result: 广泛实验表明Siren在文本到音频生成任务中超越了现有LM和扩散模型，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Siren通过将LM的表征优势与音频合成的保真度需求相结合，使LM成为文本到音频任务中与扩散模型竞争的有力竞争者，并为统一多模态生成框架提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: While language models (LMs) paired with residual vector quantization (RVQ)
tokenizers have shown promise in text-to-audio (T2A) generation, they still lag
behind diffusion-based models by a non-trivial margin. We identify a critical
dilemma underpinning this gap: incorporating more RVQ layers improves audio
reconstruction fidelity but exceeds the generation capacity of conventional
LMs. To address this, we first analyze RVQ dynamics and uncover two key
limitations: 1) orthogonality of features across RVQ layers hinders effective
LMs training, and 2) descending semantic richness in tokens from deeper RVQ
layers exacerbates exposure bias during autoregressive decoding. Based on these
insights, we propose Siren, a novel LM-based framework that employs multiple
isolated transformers with causal conditioning and anti-causal alignment via
reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Siren
outperforms both existing LM-based and diffusion-based T2A systems, achieving
state-of-the-art results. By bridging the representational strengths of LMs
with the fidelity demands of audio synthesis, our approach repositions LMs as
competitive contenders against diffusion models in T2A tasks. Moreover, by
aligning audio representations with linguistic structures, Siren facilitates a
promising pathway toward unified multi-modal generation frameworks.

Motivation: 现有音乐情感识别研究多集中于特定音乐风格，缺乏对多样化音乐类型（如摇滚和古典）的统一处理框架。本文旨在解决音频内容情感识别中的跨数据集泛化问题。

Method: 系统分析了五个具有维度情感标注的数据集（EmoMusic、DEAM、PMEmo、WTC、WCMED），结合Jukebox模型提取的嵌入特征和色度特征，构建了跨数据集训练框架。

Result: 研究发现现有数据中存在流派-情感关系、流派主导性和数据集偏差问题。提出的框架显著改善了模型的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过结合Jukebox模型嵌入和色度特征，并利用多个多样化训练集，可以训练出具有显著改进的跨数据集泛化能力的音乐情感识别模型。

Abstract: Music Emotion Recognition (MER) is a task deeply connected to human
perception, relying heavily on subjective annotations collected from
contributors. Prior studies tend to focus on specific musical styles rather
than incorporating a diverse range of genres, such as rock and classical,
within a single framework. In this paper, we address the task of recognizing
emotion from audio content by investigating five datasets with dimensional
emotion annotations -- EmoMusic, DEAM, PMEmo, WTC, and WCMED -- which span
various musical styles. We demonstrate the problem of out-of-distribution
generalization in a systematic experiment. By closely looking at multiple data
and feature sets, we provide insight into genre-emotion relationships in
existing data and examine potential genre dominance and dataset biases in
certain feature representations. Based on these experiments, we arrive at a
simple yet effective framework that combines embeddings extracted from the
Jukebox model with chroma features and demonstrate how, alongside a combination
of several diverse training sets, this permits us to train models with
substantially improved cross-dataset generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: MAVE是一种基于交叉注意力Mamba架构的新型自回归语音编辑和合成系统，在语音编辑任务上达到最先进水平，在零样本TTS任务上表现优异，同时显著降低了内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个既能实现高质量语音编辑又能进行零样本TTS的高效系统，通过结合Mamba的高效序列建模能力和交叉注意力的精确文本-声学对齐能力。

Method: 采用基于交叉注意力Mamba骨干的自回归架构，集成Mamba进行高效音频序列建模，使用交叉注意力实现精确的文本-声学对齐。

Result: 在RealEdit基准测试中，57.2%的听众认为MAVE编辑的语音与原音感知上相等；在零样本TTS中，MAVE在说话人相似度和自然度方面均优于VoiceCraft；内存需求比VoiceCraft低约6倍。

Conclusion: MAVE通过结构化状态空间建模和跨模态注意力的协同集成，为灵活、高保真的语音编辑和合成建立了新标准。

Abstract: We introduce MAVE (Mamba with Cross-Attention for Voice Editing and
Synthesis), a novel autoregressive architecture for text-conditioned voice
editing and high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, built on a
cross-attentive Mamba backbone. MAVE achieves state-of-the-art performance in
speech editing and very competitive results in zero-shot TTS, while not being
explicitly trained on the latter task, outperforming leading autoregressive and
diffusion models on diverse, real-world audio. By integrating Mamba for
efficient audio sequence modeling with cross-attention for precise
text-acoustic alignment, MAVE enables context-aware voice editing with
exceptional naturalness and speaker consistency. In pairwise human evaluations
on a random 40-sample subset of the RealEdit benchmark (400 judgments), 57.2%
of listeners rated MAVE - edited speech as perceptually equal to the original,
while 24.8% prefered the original and 18.0% MAVE - demonstrating that in the
majority of cases edits are indistinguishable from the source. MAVE compares
favorably with VoiceCraft and FluentSpeech both on pairwise comparisons and
standalone mean opinion score (MOS) evaluations. For zero-shot TTS, MAVE
exceeds VoiceCraft in both speaker similarity and naturalness, without
requiring multiple inference runs or post-processing. Remarkably, these quality
gains come with a significantly lower memory cost and approximately the same
latency: MAVE requires ~6x less memory than VoiceCraft during inference on
utterances from the RealEdit database (mean duration: 6.21s, A100, FP16, batch
size 1). Our results demonstrate that MAVE establishes a new standard for
flexible, high-fidelity voice editing and synthesis through the synergistic
integration of structured state-space modeling and cross-modal attention.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We present LegalSim, a modular multi-agent simulation of adversarial legal
proceedings that explores how AI systems can exploit procedural weaknesses in
codified rules. Plaintiff and defendant agents choose from a constrained action
space (for example, discovery requests, motions, meet-and-confer, sanctions)
governed by a JSON rules engine, while a stochastic judge model with calibrated
grant rates, cost allocations, and sanction tendencies resolves outcomes. We
compare four policies: PPO, a contextual bandit with an LLM, a direct LLM
policy, and a hand-crafted heuristic; Instead of optimizing binary case
outcomes, agents are trained and evaluated using effective win rate and a
composite exploit score that combines opponent-cost inflation, calendar
pressure, settlement pressure at low merit, and a rule-compliance margin.
Across configurable regimes (e.g., bankruptcy stays, inter partes review, tax
procedures) and heterogeneous judges, we observe emergent ``exploit chains'',
such as cost-inflating discovery sequences and calendar-pressure tactics that
remain procedurally valid yet systemically harmful. Evaluation via cross-play
and Bradley-Terry ratings shows, PPO wins more often, the bandit is the most
consistently competitive across opponents, the LLM trails them, and the
heuristic is weakest. The results are stable in judge settings, and the
simulation reveals emergent exploit chains, motivating red-teaming of legal
rule systems in addition to model-level testing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体强化学习的能量和通信高效方法，用于多AUV长期监测河流羽流，结合时空高斯过程回归和多头Q网络控制器，在模拟中优于基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多AUV长期（多天）监测河流羽流的问题，重点关注杜罗河代表性用例，需要能量和通信高效的协调方法。

Method: 集成时空高斯过程回归（GPR）与多头Q网络控制器，中央协调器间歇性地与AUV通信，收集测量数据并发出命令，调节每个AUV的方向和速度。

Result: 使用Delft3D海洋模型的模拟显示，该方法始终优于单智能体和多智能体基准，增加AUV数量既能改善均方误差又能提高运行耐久性，在某些情况下加倍AUV数量可使耐久性翻倍以上同时保持或提高精度。

Conclusion: 学习到的策略在不同月份和年份的未见季节性机制中具有泛化能力，为未来数据驱动的动态羽流环境长期监测发展展示了前景。

Abstract: We study the problem of long-term (multiple days) mapping of a river plume
using multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), focusing on the Douro
river representative use-case. We propose an energy - and communication -
efficient multi-agent reinforcement learning approach in which a central
coordinator intermittently communicates with the AUVs, collecting measurements
and issuing commands. Our approach integrates spatiotemporal Gaussian process
regression (GPR) with a multi-head Q-network controller that regulates
direction and speed for each AUV. Simulations using the Delft3D ocean model
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both single- and
multi-agent benchmarks, with scaling the number of agents both improving mean
squared error (MSE) and operational endurance. In some instances, our algorithm
demonstrates that doubling the number of AUVs can more than double endurance
while maintaining or improving accuracy, underscoring the benefits of
multi-agent coordination. Our learned policies generalize across unseen
seasonal regimes over different months and years, demonstrating promise for
future developments of data-driven long-term monitoring of dynamic plume
environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去中心化多智能体协调的需求侧管理系统，通过时段交换机制在保持系统效率的同时提升用户舒适度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有能源管理系统往往优先考虑系统效率（平衡能源供需），而牺牲了用户舒适度，需要解决这一矛盾

Method: 采用去中心化多智能体协调方法，引入时段交换机制，智能体先获得优化的设备级能耗调度，然后通过时段交换相互协调调整调度

Result: 使用真实世界数据集验证，结果显示时段交换机制提高了用户舒适度和公平性，且不增加系统低效成本

Conclusion: 该方法为未来智能电网提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案，即使在智能体表现出非利他行为时也能改善用户舒适度

Abstract: The growing electricity demand and increased use of smart appliances are
placing new pressures on power grids, making efficient energy management more
important than ever. The existing energy management systems often prioritize
system efficiency (balanced energy demand and supply) at the expense of user
comfort. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel decentralized
multi-agent coordination-based demand-side management system. The proposed
system enables individual agents to coordinate for demand-side energy
optimization while improving the user comfort and maintaining the system
efficiency. A key innovation of this work is the introduction of a slot
exchange mechanism, where agents first receive optimized appliance-level energy
consumption schedules and then coordinate with each other to adjust these
schedules through slot exchanges. This approach improves user comfort even when
agents show non-altruistic behaviour, and it scales well with large
populations. The system also promotes fairness by balancing satisfaction levels
across users. For performance evaluation, a real-world dataset is used, and the
results demonstrate that the proposed slot exchange mechanism increases user
comfort and fairness without raising system inefficiency cost, making it a
practical and scalable solution for future smart grids.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共享微移动系统面临时空需求波动的挑战，现有调度方法每天仅重新分配1-2次车辆，在非典型条件下性能容易下降。

Method: 设计分层强化学习框架SMART，结合高层初始部署和低层实时再平衡，使用少量自主共享微移动车辆动态适应实时需求。

Result: 基于芝加哥真实电动滑板车使用数据的实验表明，该框架非常有效且具有强泛化能力，能无缝集成现有车辆调度方法并显著提升服务性能。

Conclusion: SMART框架通过引入自主再平衡车辆，能够有效解决共享微移动系统的供需不匹配问题，提升整体服务性能。

Abstract: Shared micromobility systems, such as electric scooters and bikes, have
gained widespread popularity as sustainable alternatives to traditional
transportation modes. However, these systems face persistent challenges due to
spatio-temporal demand fluctuations, often resulting in a mismatch between
vehicle supply and user demand. Existing shared micromobility vehicle
scheduling methods typically redistribute vehicles once or twice per day, which
makes them vulnerable to performance degradation under atypical conditions. In
this work, we design to augment existing micromobility scheduling methods by
integrating a small number of autonomous shared micromobility vehicles (ASMVs),
which possess self-rebalancing capabilities to dynamically adapt to real-time
demand. Specifically, we introduce SMART, a hierarchical reinforcement learning
framework that jointly optimizes high-level initial deployment and low-level
real-time rebalancing for ASMVs. We evaluate our framework based on real-world
e-scooter usage data from Chicago. Our experiment results show that our
framework is highly effective and possesses strong generalization capability,
allowing it to seamlessly integrate with existing vehicle scheduling methods
and significantly enhance overall micromobility service performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为"Audit the Whisper"的多智能体LLM审计框架，包含理论分析、基准测试、检测方法和可复现性基础设施，用于检测LLM智能体间的隐蔽协调行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM多智能体部署在市场、分配和治理工作流中日益普及，但智能体间的隐蔽协调会侵蚀信任和社会福利，现有审计方法缺乏理论保证且难以跨任务迁移。

Method: 1) 信道容量分析，量化干预措施对协调能力的惩罚；2) ColludeBench-v0基准测试，涵盖定价、拍卖和同行评审场景；3) 校准审计流水线，融合互信息、排列不变性、水印方差和公平性偏差检测。

Result: 在600次审计运行中，联合元测试实现了100%真阳性率且零误报，能够识别仅靠互信息无法检测的公平性驱动的合谋行为。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了具有理论保证的审计方法，显著提升了多智能体LLM系统中隐蔽协调行为的检测能力，并提供了完整的可复现基础设施。

Abstract: Multi-agent deployments of large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
embedded in market, allocation, and governance workflows, yet covert
coordination among agents can silently erode trust and social welfare. Existing
audits are dominated by heuristics that lack theoretical guarantees, struggle
to transfer across tasks, and seldom ship with the infrastructure needed for
independent replication. We introduce \emph{Audit the Whisper}, a
conference-grade research artifact that spans theory, benchmark design,
detection, and reproducibility. Our contributions are: (i) a channel-capacity
analysis showing how interventions such as paraphrase, rate limiting, and role
permutation impose quantifiable capacity penalties -- operationalized via
paired-run Kullback--Leibler diagnostics -- that tighten mutual-information
thresholds with finite-sample guarantees; (ii) \textsc{ColludeBench}-v0,
covering pricing, first-price auctions, and peer review with configurable
covert schemes, deterministic manifests, and reward instrumentation; and (iii)
a calibrated auditing pipeline that fuses cross-run mutual information,
permutation invariance, watermark variance, and fairness-aware acceptance bias,
each tuned to a \(10^{-3}\) false-positive budget. Across 600 audited runs
spanning 12 intervention conditions, the union meta-test attains TPR~$=1$ with
zero observed false alarms, while ablations surface the price-of-auditing
trade-off and highlight fairness-driven colluders invisible to MI alone. We
release regeneration scripts, seed-stamped manifests, and documentation so that
external auditors can reproduce every figure and extend the framework with
minimal effort.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and agentic systems have
shown exceptional decision-making capabilities, revealing significant potential
for autonomic finance. Current financial trading agents predominantly simulate
anthropomorphic roles that inadvertently introduce emotional biases and rely on
peripheral information, while being constrained by the necessity for continuous
inference during deployment. In this paper, we pioneer the harmonization of
strategic depth in agents with the mechanical rationality essential for
quantitative trading. Consequently, we present TiMi (Trade in Minutes), a
rationality-driven multi-agent system that architecturally decouples strategy
development from minute-level deployment. TiMi leverages specialized LLM
capabilities of semantic analysis, code programming, and mathematical reasoning
within a comprehensive policy-optimization-deployment chain. Specifically, we
propose a two-tier analytical paradigm from macro patterns to micro
customization, layered programming design for trading bot implementation, and
closed-loop optimization driven by mathematical reflection. Extensive
evaluations across 200+ trading pairs in stock and cryptocurrency markets
empirically validate the efficacy of TiMi in stable profitability, action
efficiency, and risk control under volatile market dynamics.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的博弈论解决方案概念——下行风险感知均衡(DRAE)，基于下偏矩来限制下行风险，同时不限制上行风险，并建模高阶风险偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统博弈论对风险的看法有限，主要关注其他玩家行为不确定性对期望收益的影响。方差方法同时衡量收益的上行和下行方差，但在金融等领域，只有下行风险（潜在损失）才是关键，而上行"风险"（如利润）不是问题。

Method: 基于下偏矩提出下行风险感知均衡(DRAE)解决方案概念，限制下行风险而不限制上行风险，并建模高阶风险偏好。

Result: 在多个博弈中证明了DRAE的适用性，成功找到了平衡下行风险和期望收益的均衡，并证明了该均衡的存在性和最优性。

Conclusion: DRAE提供了一种更符合实际风险偏好的博弈论框架，特别适用于金融等关注下行风险的领域。

Abstract: Game theory has traditionally had a relatively limited view of risk based on
how a player's expected reward is impacted by the uncertainty of the actions of
other players. Recently, a new game-theoretic approach provides a more holistic
view of risk also considering the reward-variance. However, these
variance-based approaches measure variance of the reward on both the upside and
downside. In many domains, such as finance, downside risk only is of key
importance, as this represents the potential losses associated with a decision.
In contrast, large upside "risk" (e.g. profits) are not an issue. To address
this restrictive view of risk, we propose a novel solution concept, downside
risk aware equilibria (DRAE) based on lower partial moments. DRAE restricts
downside risk, while placing no restrictions on upside risk, and additionally,
models higher-order risk preferences. We demonstrate the applicability of DRAE
on several games, successfully finding equilibria which balance downside risk
with expected reward, and prove the existence and optimality of this
equilibria.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了交替梯度下降-上升算法在两人零和博弈中的收敛性能，证明了交替方法在约束设置下比同时方法具有更好的收敛速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交替方法在博弈学习中作为简单实用的方法，在数值性能上优于同时方法，但理论理解有限，特别是在约束设置下。

Method: 使用交替梯度下降-上升算法，通过理论分析和性能估计编程框架来优化步长和收敛速率。

Result: 对于存在内部纳什均衡的博弈，AltGDA以O(1/T)的遍历收敛速率收敛；对于无内部均衡的博弈，获得O(1/T)的局部收敛速率；PEP结果表明AltGDA可能达到O(1/T)收敛速率，而同时方法限于O(1/√T)。

Conclusion: 交替方法在约束博弈设置中显著优于同时方法，这是首次证明交替改进在约束设置中的优势。

Abstract: We study the alternating gradient descent-ascent (AltGDA) algorithm in
two-player zero-sum games. Alternating methods, where players take turns to
update their strategies, have long been recognized as simple and practical
approaches for learning in games, exhibiting much better numerical performance
than their simultaneous counterparts. However, our theoretical understanding of
alternating algorithms remains limited, and results are mostly restricted to
the unconstrained setting. We show that for two-player zero-sum games that
admit an interior Nash equilibrium, AltGDA converges at an $O(1/T)$ ergodic
convergence rate when employing a small constant stepsize. This is the first
result showing that alternation improves over the simultaneous counterpart of
GDA in the constrained setting. For games without an interior equilibrium, we
show an $O(1/T)$ local convergence rate with a constant stepsize that is
independent of any game-specific constants. In a more general setting, we
develop a performance estimation programming (PEP) framework to jointly
optimize the AltGDA stepsize along with its worst-case convergence rate. The
PEP results indicate that AltGDA may achieve an $O(1/T)$ convergence rate for a
finite horizon $T$, whereas its simultaneous counterpart appears limited to an
$O(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在价值分布信息有限的情况下，卖方如何设计最优销售机制。当卖方只知道均值和平均绝对偏差时，捆绑销售是最优机制，但只能保证低于均值的收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机制设计假设卖方完全了解价值分布，但现实中卖方往往只有有限信息。本文旨在开发一个分布鲁棒框架，在卖方只知道均值和平均绝对偏差的情况下，找到最优销售策略。

Method: 采用两阶段博弈框架：卖方先选择收益最大化机制，然后自然从符合已知信息的分布中选择收益最小化分布。特别关注当卖方知道均值和平均绝对偏差时的情形。

Result: 对于大范围的MAD值，捆绑销售是最优机制，但卖方只能保证严格小于均值的收益。博弈顺序不影响结果（max-min和min-max值相同），这与确定性机制和单独销售不同。

Conclusion: 捆绑销售在分布鲁棒框架下具有普遍最优性，不仅优化绝对收益，还能优化绝对遗憾和比率目标。该机制对博弈顺序不敏感，显示出鲁棒性。

Abstract: When selling many goods with independent valuations, we develop a
distributionally robust framework, consisting of a two-player game between
seller and nature. The seller has only limited knowledge about the value
distribution. The seller selects a revenue-maximizing mechanism, after which
nature chooses a revenue-minimizing distribution from all distributions that
comply with the limited knowledge. When the seller knows the mean and variance
of valuations, bundling is known to be an asymptotically optimal deterministic
mechanism, achieving a normalized revenue close to the mean. Moving beyond this
variance assumption, we assume knowledge of the mean absolute deviation (MAD),
accommodating more dispersion and heavy-tailed valuations with infinite
variance. We show for a large range of MAD values that bundling remains
optimal, but the seller can only guarantee a revenue strictly smaller than the
mean. Another noteworthy finding is indifference to the order of play, as both
the max-min and min-max versions of the problem yield identical values. This
contrasts with deterministic mechanisms and the separate sale of goods, where
the order of play significantly impacts outcomes. We further underscore the
universality of the optimal bundling price by demonstrating its efficacy in
optimizing not only absolute revenue but also the absolute regret and ratio
objective among all bundling prices

Method: 提出了IREG-PRM+算法，这是一种尺度不变且无参数的PRM+变体，通过保持遗憾向量范数非递减的特性，实现了自适应学习率的效果。

Result: IREG-PRM+实现了T^{-1/2}最佳迭代和T^{-1}（最优）平均迭代收敛保证，在基准游戏中与PRM+表现相当，且无需额外超参数。

Conclusion: IREG-PRM+成功弥合了零和博弈求解中理论与实践的差距，揭示了遗憾匹配族相对于标准优化技术的有效性，并为该领域提供了首个无需额外超参数的RVU型边界分析。

Abstract: A considerable chasm has been looming for decades between theory and practice
in zero-sum game solving through first-order methods. Although a convergence
rate of $T^{-1}$ has long been established since Nemirovski's mirror-prox
algorithm and Nesterov's excessive gap technique in the early 2000s, the most
effective paradigm in practice is *counterfactual regret minimization*, which
is based on *regret matching* and its modern variants. In particular, the state
of the art across most benchmarks is *predictive* regret matching$^+$
(PRM$^+$), in conjunction with non-uniform averaging. Yet, such algorithms can
exhibit slower $\Omega(T^{-1/2})$ convergence even in self-play.
  In this paper, we close the gap between theory and practice. We propose a new
scale-invariant and parameter-free variant of PRM$^+$, which we call
IREG-PRM$^+$. We show that it achieves $T^{-1/2}$ best-iterate and $T^{-1}$
(i.e., optimal) average-iterate convergence guarantees, while also being on par
with PRM$^+$ on benchmark games. From a technical standpoint, we draw an
analogy between IREG-PRM$^+$ and optimistic gradient descent with *adaptive*
learning rate. The basic flaw of PRM$^+$ is that the ($\ell_2$-)norm of the
regret vector -- which can be thought of as the inverse of the learning rate --
can decrease. By contrast, we design IREG-PRM$^+$ so as to maintain the
invariance that the norm of the regret vector is nondecreasing. This enables us
to derive an RVU-type bound for IREG-PRM$^+$, the first such property that does
not rely on introducing additional hyperparameters to enforce smoothness.
  Furthermore, we find that IREG-PRM$^+$ performs on par with an adaptive
version of optimistic gradient descent that we introduce whose learning rate
depends on the misprediction error, demystifying the effectiveness of the
regret matching family *vis-a-vis* more standard optimization techniques.

Motivation: 该问题不仅受实际应用驱动，还作为研究群体公平性的自然框架。由于MMS并非总是可满足的，因此考虑两种近似方法：基数和序数近似。

Method: 对于基数近似，放宽对箱子打包或覆盖的要求；对于序数近似，放宽被打包或覆盖的箱子数量。

Result: 为所有感兴趣的模型提供了常数近似算法。

Conclusion: 该研究为公平分配问题提供了有效的近似解决方案，特别是在MMS不可满足的情况下。

Abstract: We study a fundamental fair allocation problem, where the agent's value is
determined by the number of bins either used to pack or cover the items
allocated to them. Fairness is evaluated using the maximin share (MMS)
criterion. This problem is not only motivated by practical applications, but
also serves as a natural framework for studying group fairness. As MMS is not
always satisfiable, we consider two types of approximations: cardinal and
ordinal. For cardinal approximation, we relax the requirements of being packed

bins that are packed or covered. For all models of interest, we provide
constant approximation algorithms.

Conclusion: 多轮重复匹配的公平优化问题虽然计算困难，但通过近似算法和参数化方法可以在实践中有效解决，相关匹配特征对匹配理论和房屋分配有独立意义。

Abstract: We study a sequential decision-making model where a set of items is
repeatedly matched to the same set of agents over multiple rounds. The
objective is to determine a sequence of matchings that either maximizes the
utility of the least advantaged agent at the end of all rounds (optimal) or at
the end of every individual round (anytime optimal). We investigate the
computational challenges associated with finding (anytime) optimal outcomes and
demonstrate that these problems are generally computationally intractable.
However, we provide approximation algorithms, fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms, and identify several special cases whereby the problem(s) can be
solved efficiently. Along the way, we also establish characterizations of
Pareto-optimal/maximum matchings, which may be of independent interest to works
in matching theory and house allocation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究EFX（无嫉妒分配至任意商品）分配的存在性问题，特别是在线性估值情况下，旨在通过连续数学框架解决这一离散组合优化问题。

Method: 使用随机化舍入将离散EFX约束扩展到连续空间，将其表述为无约束DC优化问题，并通过构造满足Brouwer固定点定理条件的扰动连续映射来证明存在性。

Result: 证明了EFX分配存在当且仅当连续扩展目标函数的最优值为非正，且通过扰动映射找到了固定点，这为EFX分配提供了存在性保证。

Conclusion: 通过将EFX分配问题与DC优化和固定点理论联系起来，为证明EFX分配存在性提供了新途径，并为计算此类分配提供了更有效的非线性优化工具。

Abstract: We consider the problem of the existence of an envy-free allocation up to any
good (EFX) for linear valuations and establish new results by connecting this
problem to a fixed point framework. Specifically, we first use randomized
rounding to extend the discrete EFX constraints into a continuous space and
show that an EFX allocation exists if and only if the optimal value of the
continuously extended objective function is nonpositive. In particular, we
demonstrate that this optimization problem can be formulated as an
unconstrained difference of convex (DC) program, which can be further
simplified to the minimization of a piecewise linear concave function over a
polytope. Leveraging this connection, we show that the proposed DC program has
a nonpositive optimal objective value if and only if a well-defined continuous
vector map admits a fixed point. Crucially, we prove that the reformulated
fixed point problem satisfies all the conditions of Brouwer's fixed point
theorem, except that self-containedness is violated by an arbitrarily small
positive constant. To address this, we propose a slightly perturbed continuous
map that always admits a fixed point. This fixed point serves as a proxy for
the fixed point (if it exists) of the original map, and hence for an EFX
allocation through an appropriate transformation. Our results offer a new
approach to establishing the existence of EFX allocations through fixed point
theorems. Moreover, the equivalence with DC programming enables a more
efficient and systematic method for computing such allocations (if one exists)
using tools from nonlinear optimization. Our findings bridge the discrete
problem of finding an EFX allocation with two continuous frameworks: solving an
unconstrained DC program and identifying a fixed point of a continuous vector
map.

(i) constructing finite 2D/3D point sets with low star discrepancy, and (ii)
choosing Sobol' direction numbers that minimize randomized QMC error on
downstream integrands. Our two-phase procedure combines constructive code
proposals with iterative numerical refinement. On finite sets, we rediscover
known optima in small 2D cases and set new best-known 2D benchmarks for N >=
40, while matching most known 3D optima up to the proven frontier (N <= 8) and
reporting improved 3D benchmarks beyond. On digital sequences, evolving Sobol'
parameters yields consistent reductions in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (rQMC)
mean-squared error for several 32-dimensional option-pricing tasks relative to
widely used Joe--Kuo parameters, while preserving extensibility to any sample
size and compatibility with standard randomizations. Taken together, the
results demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary program synthesis can automate
the discovery of high-quality QMC constructions, recovering classical designs
where they are optimal and improving them where finite-N structure matters.

### [259] [HydroFusion-LMF: Semi-Supervised Multi-Network Fusion with Large-Model Adaptation for Long-Term Daily Runoff Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03744)
*Qianfei Fan,Jiayu Wei,Peijun Zhu,Wensheng Ye,Meie Fang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出HydroFusion-LMF框架，通过可学习的趋势-季节-残差分解、异构专家集合、水文感知门控和半监督多任务目标，在小流域十年尺度日径流预测中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小流域日径流预测中信号复杂（趋势漂移、多尺度季节周期、状态转换、稀疏极端值）的问题，现有深度学习模型通常只针对单一层面且未充分利用未标记数据，限制了状态适应性。

Method: 1) 可学习的趋势-季节-残差分解降低非平稳性；2) 残差通过紧凑异构专家集合（线性细化、频率核、补丁Transformer、循环记忆、动态归一化注意力）；3) 水文上下文感知门控融合专家输出；4) 半监督多任务目标增强监督。

Result: 在约10年日数据集上，MSE 1.0128 / MAE 0.5818，比最强基线(DLinear)提升10.2%/10.3%，比平均基线提升24.6%/17.1%，同时降低MSE和MAE。

Conclusion: 该框架在可解释性（显式组件、稀疏门控）和性能之间取得平衡，推进了非平稳条件下标签高效的水文预测。

Abstract: Accurate decade-scale daily runoff forecasting in small watersheds is
difficult because signals blend drifting trends, multi-scale seasonal cycles,
regime shifts, and sparse extremes. Prior deep models (DLinear, TimesNet,
PatchTST, TiDE, Nonstationary Transformer, LSTNet, LSTM) usually target single
facets and under-utilize unlabeled spans, limiting regime adaptivity. We
propose HydroFusion-LMF, a unified framework that (i) performs a learnable
trend-seasonal-residual decomposition to reduce non-stationarity, (ii) routes
residuals through a compact heterogeneous expert set (linear refinement,
frequency kernel, patch Transformer, recurrent memory, dynamically normalized
attention), (iii) fuses expert outputs via a hydrologic context-aware gate
conditioned on day-of-year phase, antecedent precipitation, local variance,
flood indicators, and static basin attributes, and (iv) augments supervision
with a semi-supervised multi-task objective (composite MSE/MAE + extreme
emphasis + NSE/KGE, masked reconstruction, multi-scale contrastive alignment,
augmentation consistency, variance-filtered pseudo-labeling). Optional adapter
/ LoRA layers inject a frozen foundation time-series encoder efficiently. On a
~10-year daily dataset HydroFusion-LMF attains MSE 1.0128 / MAE 0.5818,
improving the strongest baseline (DLinear) by 10.2% / 10.3% and the mean
baseline by 24.6% / 17.1%. We observe simultaneous MSE and MAE reductions
relative to baselines. The framework balances interpretability (explicit
components, sparse gating) with performance, advancing label-efficient
hydrologic forecasting under non-stationarity.

### [260] [Triple-BERT: Do We Really Need MARL for Order Dispatch on Ride-Sharing Platforms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03257)
*Zijian Zhao,Sen Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Triple-BERT方法，使用单智能体强化学习解决网约车平台大规模订单调度问题，通过动作分解策略和BERT网络处理大规模动作和观测空间，在真实数据集上比现有方法提升11.95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL方法在网约车订单调度中存在局限性：独立MARL无法捕获全局信息和有效协作，CTDE方法面临维度灾难问题。需要一种能处理大规模司机和订单的集中式方法。

Method: 基于TD3变体构建集中式单智能体强化学习，采用动作分解策略将联合动作概率分解为单个司机动作概率，使用BERT网络通过参数重用和注意力机制处理大规模观测空间。

Result: 在曼哈顿真实网约车数据集上验证，比现有最优方法提升11.95%，服务订单数增加4.26%，接客时间减少22.25%。

Conclusion: Triple-BERT成功解决了大规模订单调度中的动作和观测空间挑战，证明了集中式单智能体强化学习在此类问题中的有效性。

Abstract: On-demand ride-sharing platforms, such as Uber and Lyft, face the intricate
real-time challenge of bundling and matching passengers-each with distinct
origins and destinations-to available vehicles, all while navigating
significant system uncertainties. Due to the extensive observation space
arising from the large number of drivers and orders, order dispatching, though
fundamentally a centralized task, is often addressed using Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, independent MARL methods fail to
capture global information and exhibit poor cooperation among workers, while
Centralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL methods suffer from
the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these challenges, we propose
Triple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method
designed specifically for large-scale order dispatching on ride-sharing
platforms. Built on a variant TD3, our approach addresses the vast action space
through an action decomposition strategy that breaks down the joint action
probability into individual driver action probabilities. To handle the
extensive observation space, we introduce a novel BERT-based network, where
parameter reuse mitigates parameter growth as the number of drivers and orders
increases, and the attention mechanism effectively captures the complex
relationships among the large pool of driver and orders. We validate our method
using a real-world ride-hailing dataset from Manhattan. Triple-BERT achieves
approximately an 11.95% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods, with
a 4.26% increase in served orders and a 22.25% reduction in pickup times. Our
code, trained model parameters, and processed data are publicly available at
the repository https://github.com/RS2002/Triple-BERT .

*Xiangyu Shi,Marco Chiesa,Gerald Q. Maguire Jr.,Dejan Kostic*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KVComm是一个新颖的LLM通信框架，通过选择性共享KV对实现高效模型间通信，仅传输30%的KV对层即可达到接近直接合并输入的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM多智能体系统的通信协议要么依赖自然语言（推理成本高、信息丢失），要么依赖隐藏状态（信息集中偏差和效率低下），需要更高效的通信方法。

Method: 提出KVComm框架，基于注意力重要性分数和高斯先验的KV层选择策略，识别最具信息量的KV对进行通信。

Result: 在多样化任务和模型对上的实验表明，KVComm性能接近直接合并输入的上界方法，同时仅传输30%的KV对层。

Conclusion: KV对作为LLM间通信的有效媒介具有巨大潜力，为可扩展和高效的多智能体系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-agent
systems, where effective inter-model communication is crucial. Existing
communication protocols either rely on natural language, incurring high
inference costs and information loss, or on hidden states, which suffer from
information concentration bias and inefficiency. To address these limitations,
we propose KVComm, a novel communication framework that enables efficient
communication between LLMs through selective sharing of KV pairs. KVComm
leverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the
pitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy
based on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most
informative KV pairs for communication. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks and model pairs demonstrate that KVComm achieves comparable performance
to the upper-bound method, which directly merges inputs to one model without
any communication, while transmitting as few as 30\% of layers' KV pairs. Our
study highlights the potential of KV pairs as an effective medium for inter-LLM
communication, paving the way for scalable and efficient multi-agent systems.

*Ege Cakar,Per Ola Kristensson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出使用结构化论证方法为AI系统提供可验证的解释，而不是机制透明度。该方法在论证关系分类任务上达到SOTA性能，并支持多智能体风险评估和幻觉检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类思维是黑盒但社会通过可验证论证运作，AI可解释性应遵循相同原则——提供可验证的推理链而非机制透明度。

Method: 使用结构化论证框架，将LLM文本转换为论证图，通过双极假设基础论证捕捉支持/攻击关系，实现推理步骤的可验证性。

Result: 在AAEC数据集上达到94.44宏F1（比先前工作高5.7分），在Argumentative MicroTexts关系分类上达到0.81宏F1（比可比设置高约0.07）。

Conclusion: 结构化论证为AI系统提供了可验证的解释框架，支持多智能体协作、幻觉检测和无需重新训练的反饋迭代优化。

Abstract: Humans are black boxes -- we cannot observe their neural processes, yet
society functions by evaluating verifiable arguments. AI explainability should
follow this principle: stakeholders need verifiable reasoning chains, not
mechanistic transparency. We propose using structured argumentation to provide
a level of explanation and verification neither interpretability nor
LLM-generated explanation is able to offer. Our pipeline achieves
state-of-the-art 94.44 macro F1 on the AAEC published train/test split (5.7
points above prior work) and $0.81$ macro F1, $\sim$0.07 above previous
published results with comparable data setups, for Argumentative MicroTexts
relation classification, converting LLM text into argument graphs and enabling
verification at each inferential step. We demonstrate this idea on multi-agent
risk assessment using the Structured What-If Technique, where specialized
agents collaborate transparently to carry out risk assessment otherwise
achieved by humans alone. Using Bipolar Assumption-Based Argumentation, we
capture support/attack relationships, thereby enabling automatic hallucination
detection via fact nodes attacking arguments. We also provide a verification
mechanism that enables iterative refinement through test-time feedback without
retraining. For easy deployment, we provide a Docker container for the
fine-tuned AMT model, and the rest of the code with the Bipolar ABA Python
package on GitHub.

Motivation: 解决多机器人在狭窄拥挤环境中因拥堵和干扰导致的集体任务性能下降问题，受昆虫群体通过信息素实现鲁棒协调的启发。

Method: 采用基于虚拟信息素的S-MADRL框架，结合课程学习将复杂任务分解为逐步困难的子问题，实现去中心化协调而无需显式通信。

Result: 在最多8个智能体的仿真中实现了最有效的协调，机器人自组织形成非对称工作负载分布，减少拥堵并调节群体性能。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在通信受限的拥挤环境中实现可扩展去中心化多智能体协调的解决方案，涌现行为类似于自然界观察到的策略。

Abstract: We address the challenge of coordinating multiple robots in narrow and
confined environments, where congestion and interference often hinder
collective task performance. Drawing inspiration from insect colonies, which
achieve robust coordination through stigmergy -- modifying and interpreting
environmental traces -- we propose a Stigmergic Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement
Learning (S-MADRL) framework that leverages virtual pheromones to model local
and social interactions, enabling decentralized emergent coordination without
explicit communication. To overcome the convergence and scalability limitations
of existing algorithms such as MADQN, MADDPG, and MAPPO, we leverage curriculum
learning, which decomposes complex tasks into progressively harder
sub-problems. Simulation results show that our framework achieves the most
effective coordination of up to eight agents, where robots self-organize into
asymmetric workload distributions that reduce congestion and modulate group
performance. This emergent behavior, analogous to strategies observed in
nature, demonstrates a scalable solution for decentralized multi-agent
coordination in crowded environments with communication constraints.

TL;DR: 首次将多智能体强化学习应用于高空气球协同区域覆盖，QMIX方法在分布式区域覆盖中达到与理论最优几何确定性方法相当的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体HAB协调方法使用确定性方法，在小团队和局部任务中表现不佳，而多智能体强化学习在HAB协调中尚未被研究

Method: 扩展RLHAB模拟环境支持多智能体协同学习，采用QMIX算法结合集中训练分散执行，使用包含个体状态、环境上下文和队友数据的专门观测空间，以及优先覆盖并鼓励空间分布的层次化奖励

Result: QMIX在分布式区域覆盖中达到与理论最优几何确定性方法相似的性能

Conclusion: 验证了MARL方法的有效性，为更复杂的自主多HAB任务奠定了基础，特别是在确定性方法变得难以处理的情况下

Abstract: High Altitude Balloons (HABs) can leverage stratospheric wind layers for
limited horizontal control, enabling applications in reconnaissance,
environmental monitoring, and communications networks. Existing multi-agent HAB
coordination approaches use deterministic methods like Voronoi partitioning and
extremum seeking control for large global constellations, which perform poorly
for smaller teams and localized missions. While single-agent HAB control using
reinforcement learning has been demonstrated on HABs, coordinated multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) has not yet been investigated. This work presents
the first systematic application of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
to HAB coordination for distributed area coverage. We extend our previously
developed reinforcement learning simulation environment (RLHAB) to support
cooperative multi-agent learning, enabling multiple agents to operate
simultaneously in realistic atmospheric conditions. We adapt QMIX for HAB area
coverage coordination, leveraging Centralized Training with Decentralized
Execution to address atmospheric vehicle coordination challenges. Our approach
employs specialized observation spaces providing individual state,
environmental context, and teammate data, with hierarchical rewards
prioritizing coverage while encouraging spatial distribution. We demonstrate
that QMIX achieves similar performance to the theoretically optimal geometric
deterministic method for distributed area coverage, validating the MARL
approach and providing a foundation for more complex autonomous multi-HAB
missions where deterministic methods become intractable.

TL;DR: CS-RLHF提出了一种新的安全强化学习方法，通过基于惩罚的公式确保LLM输出的安全性，避免了传统CMDP方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CMDP的方法存在两个主要问题：对评分机制高度敏感，以及双重变量调优计算成本高且无法提供可证明的安全保证。

Method: 引入基于大规模语料训练的成本模型来分配语义安全分数，采用修正的基于惩罚的公式，利用精确惩罚函数理论直接强制执行约束满足。

Result: 实证评估显示CS-RLHF优于最先进的LLM模型响应，对正常和越狱提示的效率至少提高5倍。

Conclusion: CS-RLHF通过消除双重变量更新的需求，在优化器中保证了安全约束的可行性，为LLM安全提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring safety is a foundational requirement for large language models
(LLMs). Achieving an appropriate balance between enhancing the utility of model
outputs and mitigating their potential for harm is a complex and persistent
challenge. Contemporary approaches frequently formalize this problem within the
framework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) and employ
established CMDP optimization techniques. However, these methods exhibit two
notable limitations. First, their reliance on reward and cost functions renders
performance highly sensitive to the underlying scoring mechanism, which must
capture semantic meaning rather than being triggered by superficial keywords.
Second, CMDP-based training entails tuning dual-variable, a process that is
both computationally expensive and does not provide any provable safety
guarantee for a fixed dual variable that can be exploitable through adversarial
jailbreaks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Certifiable Safe-RLHF
(CS-RLHF) that introduces a cost model trained on a large-scale corpus to
assign semantically grounded safety scores. In contrast to the lagrangian-based
approach, CS-RLHF adopts a rectified penalty-based formulation. This design
draws on the theory of exact penalty functions in constrained optimization,
wherein constraint satisfaction is enforced directly through a suitably chosen
penalty term. With an appropriately scaled penalty, feasibility of the safety
constraints can be guaranteed at the optimizer, eliminating the need for
dual-variable updates. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CS-RLHF
outperforms state-of-the-art LLM model responses rendering at-least 5 times
efficient against nominal and jail-breaking prompts

TL;DR: 本文系统性地比较了不同图神经网络架构在电力系统故障诊断中的性能，发现RGATv2模型具有最佳泛化能力，在不同拓扑设置下F1分数仅下降约12%，而纯RNN模型性能下降高达60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力配电网络故障检测对系统可靠性至关重要，但现有方法需要适应不断变化的电网拓扑结构。当前基于RNN+GNN的方法中，GCN架构已被采用，但其他更先进的GNN架构尚未在电力系统故障诊断中得到充分探索。

Method: 采用RNN+GNN流水线模型，首次将GraphSAGE和Graph Attention（GAT、GATv2）架构应用于故障诊断，并与现有的RGCN和纯RNN模型（特别是GRU）进行系统性对比，特别关注模型在不同训练设置下的泛化能力。

Result: 在IEEE 123节点配电网络上的实验结果显示，RGATv2具有最优的泛化能力，在不同拓扑设置下F1分数仅下降约12%。相比之下，纯RNN模型性能下降高达60%，其他RGNN变体也表现出显著性能下降，F1分数最多降低25%。

Conclusion: RGATv2模型在电力系统故障诊断中展现出卓越的泛化性能，能够有效应对电网拓扑变化，为实际部署提供了可靠的技术方案。

Abstract: Fault detection in power distribution grids is critical for ensuring system
reliability and preventing costly outages. Moreover, fault detection
methodologies should remain robust to evolving grid topologies caused by
factors such as reconfigurations, equipment failures, and Distributed Energy
Resource (DER) integration. Current data-driven state-of-the-art methods use
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for temporal modeling and Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for spatial learning, in an RNN+GNN pipeline setting (RGNN in
short). Specifically, for power system fault diagnosis, Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCNs) have been adopted. Yet, various more advanced GNN architectures
have been proposed and adopted in domains outside of power systems. In this
paper, we set out to systematically and consistently benchmark various GNN
architectures in an RNN+GNN pipeline model. Specifically, to the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to (i) propose to use GraphSAGE and Graph Attention
(GAT, GATv2) in an RGNN for fault diagnosis, and (ii) provide a comprehensive
benchmark against earlier proposed RGNN solutions (RGCN) as well as pure RNN
models (especially Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)), particularly (iii) exploring
their generalization potential for deployment in different settings than those
used for training them. Our experimental results on the IEEE 123-node
distribution network show that RGATv2 has superior generalization capabilities,
maintaining high performance with an F1-score reduction of $\sim$12% across
different topology settings. In contrast, pure RNN models largely fail,
experiencing an F1-score reduction of up to $\sim$60%, while other RGNN
variants also exhibit significant performance degradation, i.e., up to
$\sim$25% lower F1-scores.

Motivation: 随着电网波动性增加，虽然预测数据丰富，但其在驱动实际BESS交易决策中的实用价值尚未充分探索，需要填补这一研究空白。

Conclusion: 研究结果将为能源市场交易模型的改进提供信息，并促进BESS更有效地融入市场运营。

Abstract: In electricity markets around the world, the ability to anticipate price
movements with precision can be the difference between profit and loss,
especially for fast-acting assets like battery energy storage systems (BESS).
As grid volatility increases due to renewables and market decentralisation,
operators and forecasters alike face growing pressure to transform prediction
into strategy. Yet while forecast data is abundant, especially in advanced
markets like Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM), its practical value
in driving real-world BESS trading decisions remains largely unexplored. This
thesis dives into that gap. This work addresses a key research question: Can
the accuracy of the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) energy price
forecasts be systematically leveraged to develop a reliable and profitable
battery energy storage system trading algorithm? Despite the availability of
AEMO price forecasts, no existing framework evaluates their reliability or
incorporates them into practical BESS trading strategies. By analysing patterns
in forecast accuracy based on time of day, forecast horizon, and regional
variations, this project creates a novel, forecast-informed BESS trading model
to optimise arbitrage financial returns. The performance of this
forecast-driven algorithm is benchmarked against a basic trading algorithm with
no knowledge of forecast data. The study further explores the potential of
machine learning techniques to predict future energy prices by enhancing AEMO
forecasts to govern a more advanced trading strategy. The research outcomes
will inform future improvements in energy market trading models and promote
more efficient BESS integration into market operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HOFLON是一种混合离线学习+在线优化方法，用于解决连续过程工厂启动和产品等级转换中的操作自动化问题，通过结合离线学习的数据流形和Q值评估器与在线优化，超越了传统离线强化学习的局限性和人类专家的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着经验丰富的操作人员逐渐退休，工厂面临缺乏执行启动和产品等级转换所需隐性知识的挑战。传统离线强化学习在数据分布偏移和值过高估计方面存在局限，需要一种能克服这些限制的方法来自动化这些关键操作。

Method: HOFLON采用混合方法：离线阶段学习数据流形表示可行区域和长时域Q值评估器；在线阶段通过单步优化问题最大化Q值，同时惩罚偏离学习流形和操纵变量变化率过大的情况。

Result: 在两个工业案例研究（聚合反应器启动和造纸机等级转换）中，HOFLON不仅超越了领先的离线RL算法IQL，而且平均累积奖励超过了历史数据中观察到的最佳启动或等级转换表现。

Conclusion: HOFLON展示了自动化过渡操作超越当前专家能力的潜力，为解决工厂操作中关键过渡阶段的自动化问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Start-ups and product grade-changes are critical steps in continuous-process
plant operation, because any misstep immediately affects product quality and
drives operational losses. These transitions have long relied on manual
operation by a handful of expert operators, but the progressive retirement of
that workforce is leaving plant owners without the tacit know-how needed to
execute them consistently. In the absence of a process model, offline
reinforcement learning (RL) promises to capture and even surpass human
expertise by mining historical start-up and grade-change logs, yet standard
offline RL struggles with distribution shift and value-overestimation whenever
a learned policy ventures outside the data envelope. We introduce HOFLON
(Hybrid Offline Learning + Online Optimization) to overcome those limitations.
Offline, HOFLON learns (i) a latent data manifold that represents the feasible
region spanned by past transitions and (ii) a long-horizon Q-critic that
predicts the cumulative reward from state-action pairs. Online, it solves a
one-step optimization problem that maximizes the Q-critic while penalizing
deviations from the learned manifold and excessive rates of change in the
manipulated variables. We test HOFLON on two industrial case studies: a
polymerization reactor start-up and a paper-machine grade-change problem, and
benchmark it against Implicit Q-Learning (IQL), a leading offline-RL algorithm.
In both plants HOFLON not only surpasses IQL but also delivers, on average,
better cumulative rewards than the best start-up or grade-change observed in
the historical data, demonstrating its potential to automate transition
operations beyond current expert capability.

Motivation: 解决异构联邦学习中超参数选择困难的问题，传统手动调参过程耗时且计算成本高，特别是在客户端计算能力和数据分布非独立同分布的情况下。

Method: 将联邦学习建模为动态系统，借鉴数值模拟和物理设计原理，通过临界阻尼选择动量参数，根据数值模拟精度要求自适应选择客户端和中央服务器的学习率，使用单一全局超参数动态调整所有参数。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了完全集成的自适应解决方案，无需客户端和服务器更新的超参数调优，适合快速原型设计和可扩展部署。

Abstract: Hyperparameter selection is critical for stable and efficient convergence of
heterogeneous federated learning, where clients differ in computational
capabilities, and data distributions are non-IID. Tuning hyperparameters is a
manual and computationally expensive process as the hyperparameter space grows
combinatorially with the number of clients. To address this, we introduce an
end-to-end adaptive federated learning method in which both clients and central
agents adaptively select their local learning rates and momentum parameters.
Our approach models federated learning as a dynamical system, allowing us to
draw on principles from numerical simulation and physical design. Through this
perspective, selecting momentum parameters equates to critically damping the
system for fast, stable convergence, while learning rates for clients and
central servers are adaptively selected to satisfy accuracy properties from
numerical simulation. The result is an adaptive, momentum-based federated
learning algorithm in which the learning rates for clients and servers are
dynamically adjusted and controlled by a single, global hyperparameter. By
designing a fully integrated solution for both adaptive client updates and
central agent aggregation, our method is capable of handling key challenges of
heterogeneous federated learning, including objective inconsistency and client
drift. Importantly, our approach achieves fast convergence while being
insensitive to the choice of the global hyperparameter, making it well-suited
for rapid prototyping and scalable deployment. Compared to state-of-the-art
adaptive methods, our framework is shown to deliver superior convergence for
heterogeneous federated learning while eliminating the need for hyperparameter
tuning both client and server updates.

Abstract: Understanding the robustness of deep learning models for multivariate
long-term time series forecasting (M-LTSF) remains challenging, as evaluations
typically rely on real-world datasets with unknown noise properties. We propose
a simulation-based evaluation framework that generates parameterizable
synthetic datasets, where each dataset instance corresponds to a different
configuration of signal components, noise types, signal-to-noise ratios, and
frequency characteristics. These configurable components aim to model
real-world multivariate time series data without the ambiguity of unknown
noise. This framework enables fine-grained, systematic evaluation of M-LTSF
models under controlled and diverse scenarios. We benchmark four representative
architectures S-Mamba (state-space), iTransformer (transformer-based), R-Linear
(linear), and Autoformer (decomposition-based). Our analysis reveals that all
models degrade severely when lookback windows cannot capture complete periods
of seasonal patters in the data. S-Mamba and Autoformer perform best on
sawtooth patterns, while R-Linear and iTransformer favor sinusoidal signals.
White and Brownian noise universally degrade performance with lower

shows seasonal-noise vulnerability. Further spectral analysis shows that
S-Mamba and iTransformer achieve superior frequency reconstruction. This
controlled approach, based on our synthetic and principle-driven testbed,
offers deeper insights into model-specific strengths and limitations through
the aggregation of MSE scores and provides concrete guidance for model
selection based on signal characteristics and noise conditions.

Abstract: Effective exploration remains a central challenge in model-based
reinforcement learning (MBRL), particularly in high-dimensional continuous
control tasks where sample efficiency is crucial. A prominent line of recent
work leverages learned policies as proposal distributions for Model-Predictive
Path Integral (MPPI) planning. Initial approaches update the sampling policy
independently of the planner distribution, typically maximizing a learned value
function with deterministic policy gradient and entropy regularization.
However, because the states encountered during training depend on the MPPI
planner, aligning the sampling policy with the planner improves the accuracy of
value estimation and long-term performance. To this end, recent methods update
the sampling policy by minimizing KL divergence to the planner distribution or
by introducing planner-guided regularization into the policy update. In this
work, we unify these MPPI-based reinforcement learning methods under a single
framework by introducing Policy Optimization-Model Predictive Control (PO-MPC),
a family of KL-regularized MBRL methods that integrate the planner's action
distribution as a prior in policy optimization. By aligning the learned policy
with the planner's behavior, PO-MPC allows more flexibility in the policy
updates to trade off Return maximization and KL divergence minimization. We
clarify how prior approaches emerge as special cases of this family, and we
explore previously unstudied variations. Our experiments show that these
extended configurations yield significant performance improvements, advancing
the state of the art in MPPI-based RL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FCFS调度策略存在头部阻塞问题，长任务会延迟短任务的执行，影响LLM推理服务的延迟和吞吐量。

Method: 使用成对排序和边界排序损失来近似SJF调度，预测基于响应长度的任务排序，并集成到vLLM系统中。

Result: 在多个LLM和真实推理数据集上的实验表明，PARS显著提升了性能，包括推理工作负载，且设计具有良好的跨模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: PARS通过提示感知调度有效解决了LLM推理中的头部阻塞问题，实现了低延迟高吞吐的服务。

Abstract: Efficient scheduling of LLM inference tasks is essential for achieving low
latency and high throughput, particularly with the growing use of
reasoning-capable LLMs. Traditional strategies like First-Come-First-Serve
(FCFS) often suffer from Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking, where long-running tasks
delay shorter ones queued behind them. In this paper, we introduce PARS, a
prompt-aware LLM task scheduler that improves serving efficiency by
approximating shortest-job-first (SJF) scheduling through pairwise ranking with
margin ranking loss. PARS focuses on impactful scheduling decisions and is
seamlessly integrated into the state-of-the-art LLM serving system vLLM. It
effectively predicts response-length-based task ordering, reducing latency with
minimal overhead. Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and real-world
inference datasets show that PARS significantly improves performance, including
for reasoning workloads. Furthermore, our cross-model evaluations demonstrate
that the design generalizes well, enabling effective scheduling even when
predictors are trained on different LLMs.

Conclusion: VIFO通过跨模态方法成功解决了通道独立模型忽略跨通道依赖的问题，利用大视觉模型的能力显著提升了时间序列预测性能，同时保持了训练效率。

Abstract: Large time series foundation models often adopt channel-independent
architectures to handle varying data dimensions, but this design ignores
crucial cross-channel dependencies. Concurrently, existing multimodal
approaches have not fully exploited the power of large vision models (LVMs) to
interpret spatiotemporal data. Additionally, there remains significant
unexplored potential in leveraging the advantages of information extraction
from different modalities to enhance time series forecasting performance. To
address these gaps, we propose the VIFO, a cross-modal forecasting model. VIFO
uniquely renders multivariate time series into image, enabling pre-trained LVM
to extract complex cross-channel patterns that are invisible to
channel-independent models. These visual features are then aligned and fused
with representations from the time series modality. By freezing the LVM and
training only 7.45% of its parameters, VIFO achieves competitive performance on
multiple benchmarks, offering an efficient and effective solution for capturing
cross-variable relationships in

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the presence of
real world noise and intentional perturbations remains a significant challenge.
To address this, attribution methods have been proposed, though their efficacy
remains suboptimal and necessitates further refinement. In this paper, we
propose a novel category of transferable adversarial attacks, called
transferable frequency-aware attacks, enabling frequency-aware exploration via
both high-and low-frequency components. Based on this type of attacks, we also
propose a novel attribution method, named Frequency-Aware Model Parameter
Explorer (FAMPE), which improves the explainability for DNNs. Relative to the
current state-of-the-art method AttEXplore, our FAMPE attains an average gain
of 13.02% in Insertion Score, thereby outperforming existing approaches.
Through detailed ablation studies, we also investigate the role of both high-
and low-frequency components in explainability.

Abstract: Pruning is critical for scaling large language models (LLMs). Global pruning
achieves strong performance but requires $\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory, which is
infeasible for billion-parameter models. Local pruning reduces GPU memory usage
to that of a single layer by pruning layers independently, but it neglects
inter-layer dependencies and often leads to suboptimal performance in
high-sparsity regimes. Unlike unstructured pruning, structured pruning produces
regular sparsity patterns that align well with GPU kernels and library
optimizations, making it more hardware-efficient. However, structured pruning
typically relies on global pruning, since structured patterns are more prone to
severe performance degradation under local optimization. To jointly achieve
structured pruning and the memory efficiency of local pruning, we propose a
divide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the global pruning problem into
coordinated subproblems across different modules, each of which fits within
limited GPU memory. Building on this idea, we design \textbf{STRUPRUNE}, an
ADMM-based framework that integrates structured sparsity into the pruning
process, combining the memory efficiency of local pruning with the hardware
compatibility of structured methods. We derive a closed-form analytical
solution for structured pruning masks that provides an explicit rule for
layer-wise sparsity allocation, and further develop an energy-based asymptotic
framework yielding a softmax-form allocation scheme that simplifies
optimization while adapting to heterogeneous layer importance. Experiments
demonstrate that STRUPRUNE matches the perplexity of global structured pruning
while reducing memory cost from $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
enabling practical deployment at the billion-parameter scale.

Abstract: Active learning (AL) is a principled strategy to reduce annotation cost in
data-hungry deep learning. However, existing AL algorithms focus almost
exclusively on unimodal data, overlooking the substantial annotation burden in
multimodal learning. We introduce the first framework for multimodal active
learning with unaligned data, where the learner must actively acquire
cross-modal alignments rather than labels on pre-aligned pairs. This setting
captures the practical bottleneck in modern multimodal pipelines such as CLIP
and SigLIP, where unimodal features are easy to obtain but high-quality
alignment is costly. We develop a new algorithm that combines uncertainty and
diversity principles in a modality-aware design, achieves linear-time
acquisition, and applies seamlessly to both pool-based and streaming-based
settings. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently reduces multimodal annotation cost while preserving
performance; for instance, on the ColorSwap dataset it cuts annotation
requirements by up to $40\%$ without loss in accuracy.

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health concern, with over
69 million cases annually worldwide. Finite element (FE) models offer
high-fidelity predictions of brain deformation but are computationally
expensive, requiring hours per simulation and limiting their clinical utility
for rapid decision-making. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art neural
operator (NO) architectures for rapid, patient-specific prediction of brain
displacement fields, aiming to enable real-time TBI modeling in clinical and
translational settings. We formulated TBI modeling as an operator learning
problem, mapping subject-specific anatomical MRI, magnetic resonance
elastography (MRE) stiffness maps, and demographic features to full-field 3D
brain displacement predictions. Four architectures - Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO), Factorized FNO (F-FNO), Multi-Grid FNO (MG-FNO), and Deep Operator
Network (DeepONet) were trained and evaluated on 249 MRE datasets across
physiologically relevant frequencies (20 - 90 Hz). MG-FNO achieved the highest
accuracy (MSE = 0.0023, 94.3\% spatial fidelity) and preserved fine-scale
features, while F-FNO converged 2$\times$ faster than standard FNO. DeepONet
offered the fastest inference (14.5 iterations/s) with a 7$\times$
computational speed-up over MG-FNO, suggesting utility for embedded or edge
computing applications. All NOs reduced computation time from hours to
milliseconds without sacrificing anatomical realism. NOs provide an efficient,
resolution-invariant approach for predicting brain deformation, opening the
door to real-time, patient-specific TBI risk assessment, clinical triage
support, and optimization of protective equipment. These results highlight the
potential for NO-based digital twins of the human brain, enabling scalable,
on-demand biomechanical modeling in both clinical and population health
contexts.

TL;DR: Numerion是一个基于多重超复数空间的时间序列预测模型，通过将时间序列映射到不同维度的超复数空间，自然分解并独立建模序列，最终通过动态融合机制自适应融合不同空间中的潜在模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过复杂模型结构和先验知识分解时间序列，但受限于计算复杂性和假设的鲁棒性。研究发现，在复数域和更高阶超复数空间中，时间序列的特征频率会自然降低。

Method: 提出Numerion模型，将线性层和激活函数推广到任意2的幂次维度的超复数空间，引入新的实-超复数-实域多层感知器(RHR-MLP)架构，使用多个RHR-MLP将时间序列映射到不同维度的超复数空间进行分解和建模。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上达到最先进的性能，可视化和定量分析全面证明了多维RHR-MLP自然分解时间序列的能力，并揭示了更高维超复数空间倾向于捕捉更低频率特征的趋势。

Conclusion: Numerion通过利用超复数空间中时间序列特征频率自然降低的特性，提供了一种有效的时间序列分解和预测方法，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Many methods aim to enhance time series forecasting by decomposing the series
through intricate model structures and prior knowledge, yet they are inevitably
limited by computational complexity and the robustness of the assumptions. Our
research uncovers that in the complex domain and higher-order hypercomplex
spaces, the characteristic frequencies of time series naturally decrease.
Leveraging this insight, we propose Numerion, a time series forecasting model
based on multiple hypercomplex spaces. Specifically, grounded in theoretical
support, we generalize linear layers and activation functions to hypercomplex
spaces of arbitrary power-of-two dimensions and introduce a novel
Real-Hypercomplex-Real Domain Multi-Layer Perceptron (RHR-MLP) architecture.
Numerion utilizes multiple RHR-MLPs to map time series into hypercomplex spaces
of varying dimensions, naturally decomposing and independently modeling the
series, and adaptively fuses the latent patterns exhibited in different spaces
through a dynamic fusion mechanism. Experiments validate the model`s
performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple public datasets.
Visualizations and quantitative analyses comprehensively demonstrate the
ability of multi-dimensional RHR-MLPs to naturally decompose time series and
reveal the tendency of higher dimensional hypercomplex spaces to capture lower
frequency features.

Abstract: Multi-domain translation (MDT) aims to learn translations between multiple
domains, yet existing approaches either require fully aligned tuples or can
only handle domain pairs seen in training, limiting their practicality and
excluding many cross-domain mappings. We introduce universal MDT (UMDT), a
generalization of MDT that seeks to translate between any pair of $K$ domains
using only $K-1$ paired datasets with a central domain. To tackle this problem,
we propose Diffusion Router (DR), a unified diffusion-based framework that
models all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations with a single noise
predictor conditioned on the source and target domain labels. DR enables
indirect non-central translations by routing through the central domain. We
further introduce a novel scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound
objective and an efficient Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct
non-central mappings. Through evaluation on three large-scale UMDT benchmarks,
DR achieves state-of-the-art results for both indirect and direct translations,
while lowering sampling cost and unlocking novel tasks such as
sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. These results establish DR as a scalable
and versatile framework for universal translation across multiple domains.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents are increasingly tasked
with solving complex, long-horizon problems. Aligning these agents via
preference-based offline methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a
promising direction, yet it faces a critical granularity mismatch.
Trajectory-level DPO provides a signal that is too coarse for precise credit
assignment, while step-level DPO is often too myopic to capture the value of
multi-step behaviors. To resolve this challenge, we introduce Hierarchical
Preference Learning (HPL), a hierarchical framework that optimizes LLM agents
by leveraging preference signals at multiple, synergistic granularities. While
HPL incorporates trajectory- and step-level DPO for global and local policy
stability, its core innovation lies in group-level preference optimization
guided by a dual-layer curriculum. Our approach first decomposes expert
trajectories into semantically coherent action groups and then generates
contrasting suboptimal groups to enable preference learning at a fine-grained,
sub-task level. Then, instead of treating all preference pairs equally, HPL
introduces a curriculum scheduler that organizes the learning process from
simple to complex. This curriculum is structured along two axes: the group
length, representing sub-task complexity, and the sample difficulty, defined by
the reward gap between preferred and dispreferred action groups. Experiments on
three challenging agent benchmarks show that HPL outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods. Our analyses demonstrate that the hierarchical DPO
loss effectively integrates preference signals across multiple granularities,
while the dual-layer curriculum is crucial for enabling the agent to solve a
wide range of tasks, from simple behaviors to complex multi-step sequences.

Result: 基准测试了17个模型，发现通用大语言模型比专门的时间序列模型具有更强的泛化能力，而将时间序列表示为文本或图像会因序列过长或数值精度损失而限制性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作填补了科学时间序列专用基准和建模框架的空白，为大语言模型理解和生成复杂的时间科学数据铺平了道路。

Abstract: The scientific reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) has recently
attracted significant attention. Time series, as a fundamental modality in
scientific data, presents unique challenges that are often overlooked in
current multimodal LLMs, which either encode numerical sequences as text or
convert them into images. Such approaches may be insufficient for comprehensive
scientific time series understanding and generation. Existing unified time
series models typically specialise in either forecasting or analysis, and their
effectiveness on non-periodic, heterogeneous scientific signals remains
unclear. To address these gaps, we introduce SciTS, a benchmark spanning 12
scientific domains and 43 tasks, with over 50k+ instances, both univariate and
multivariate signals ranging from $10^0$ to $10^7$ in length and up to 10~MHz
in frequency. We benchmark 17 models, including text-only LLMs, multimodal
LLMs, and unified time series models, and find that general-purpose LLMs
exhibit stronger generalisability than specialised time series models, while
representing time series as text or images limits their performance due to
excessively long sequences and loss of numerical precision, respectively. We
then introduce TimeOmni, a framework that equips LLMs with the ability to
understand and generate time series while remaining compatible with
general-purpose LLM training. This work fills a gap in both dedicated
benchmarks and modelling frameworks for scientific time series, paving the way
for LLMs to understand and generate complex temporal scientific data.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to transfer knowledge from a source model to
unknown test data with potential distribution shifts in an online manner. Many
existing TTA methods rely on entropy as a confidence metric to optimize the
model. However, these approaches are sensitive to the predefined entropy
threshold, influencing which samples are chosen for model adaptation.
Consequently, potentially reliable target samples are often overlooked and
underutilized. For instance, a sample's entropy might slightly exceed the
threshold initially, but fall below it after the model is updated. Such samples
can provide stable supervised information and offer a normal range of gradients
to guide model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a general approach,
\underline{POEM}, to promote TTA via ex\underline{\textbf{p}}loring the
previously unexpl\underline{\textbf{o}}red reliabl\underline{\textbf{e}}
sa\underline{\textbf{m}}ples. Additionally, we introduce an extra Adapt Branch
network to strike a balance between extracting domain-agnostic representations
and achieving high performance on target data. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple architectures demonstrate that POEM consistently outperforms existing
TTA methods in both challenging scenarios and real-world domain shifts, while
remaining computationally efficient. The effectiveness of POEM is evaluated
through extensive analyses and thorough ablation studies. Moreover, the core
idea behind POEM can be employed as an augmentation strategy to boost the
performance of existing TTA approaches. The source code is publicly available

Result: 在领域内任务上显著提升准确率和训练效率，AIME25任务准确率提升19.3%，六个数学基准平均提升6.2%，GRPO训练速度提升1.28倍；在领域外基准上，GPQA-Diamond提升3.87%，13个基准平均提升2.08%。

Conclusion: 元认知对齐能直接转化为性能提升，MASA方法通过自我对齐有效增强模型的元认知能力，并具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent studies on reasoning models explore the meta-awareness of language
models, the ability to know how to think by itself. We argue that large
reasoning models lack this meta-awareness property by proving severe
misalignment between true rollouts and predicted meta information. We posit
that aligning meta-prediction with true rollouts will lead to significant
performance gains. To verify this hypothesis, we design a training pipeline
that boosts Meta-Awareness via Self-Alignment (MASA), and prove that enhanced
meta-awareness directly translates to improved accuracy. Unlike existing
meta-cognitive reasoning models, our method does not require external training
sources but leverages self-generated signals to train meta-awareness. Moreover,
our method enables efficient training by i) filtering out zero-variance prompts
that are either trivial or unsolvable and ii) cutting off lengthy rollouts when
they are unlikely to lead to correct answers. The results are inspiring: our
strategy yields significant improvements in both accuracy and training
efficiency on in-domain tasks and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain
benchmarks. More specifically, our method can speed up GRPO training by over
1.28x to reach the same performance, and achieve a 19.3% gain in accuracy on
AIME25, and a 6.2 % average gain over six mathematics benchmarks. Training with
meta-cognitive guidance enhances out-of-domain generalization, giving a 3.87 %
boost on GPQA-Diamond and a 2.08 % overall accuracy gain across 13 benchmarks
spanning logical, scientific, and coding domains.

*Juan Jose Herrera-Aranda,Guillermo Gomez-Trenado,Francisco Herrera,Isaac Triguero*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在归纳式零样本学习中的属性选择方法，通过模拟未见条件来评估属性相关性，使用两种互补的特征选择策略（RFS和GA）来减少语义空间中的冗余，显著提高了未见类的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本学习在开放世界场景中很重要，但语义空间常包含噪声、冗余或不相关的属性，这会阻碍性能。需要一种方法在不访问未见类语义信息的情况下评估属性相关性。

Method: 提出了一种分区方案模拟未见条件，研究了两种特征选择策略：1）RFS将模型驱动的排名转化为语义剪枝；2）GA使用进化计算直接探索属性子空间。在五个基准数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 两种方法都通过减少冗余一致提高了未见类的准确率：RFS高效且具有竞争力但依赖关键超参数，GA成本更高但能更广泛地探索搜索空间且避免这种依赖。

Conclusion: 语义空间本质上是冗余的，提出的分区方案是在归纳条件下精炼语义空间的有效工具，两种方法以互补的方式提高了零样本学习性能。

Abstract: Zero-Shot Learning is an important paradigm within General-Purpose Artificial
Intelligence Systems, particularly in those that operate in open-world
scenarios where systems must adapt to new tasks dynamically. Semantic spaces
play a pivotal role as they bridge seen and unseen classes, but whether
human-annotated or generated by a machine learning model, they often contain
noisy, redundant, or irrelevant attributes that hinder performance. To address
this, we introduce a partitioning scheme that simulates unseen conditions in an
inductive setting (which is the most challenging), allowing attribute relevance
to be assessed without access to semantic information from unseen classes.
Within this framework, we study two complementary feature-selection strategies
and assess their generalisation. The first adapts embedded feature selection to
the particular demands of ZSL, turning model-driven rankings into meaningful
semantic pruning; the second leverages evolutionary computation to directly
explore the space of attribute subsets more broadly. Experiments on five
benchmark datasets (AWA2, CUB, SUN, aPY, FLO) show that both methods
consistently improve accuracy on unseen classes by reducing redundancy, but in
complementary ways: RFS is efficient and competitive though dependent on
critical hyperparameters, whereas GA is more costly yet explores the search
space more broadly and avoids such dependence. These results confirm that
semantic spaces are inherently redundant and highlight the proposed
partitioning scheme as an effective tool to refine them under inductive
conditions.

*Andi Zhang,Xuan Ding,Haofan Wang,Steven McDonagh,Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出正交蒙特卡洛Dropout方法，在合并LoRA模块时强制保持正交性以避免语义向量干扰，但实证发现正交性本身不足以实现语义组合性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA模块合并时语义向量会相互干扰，影响组合效果，需要解决干扰问题以实现更好的语义组合。

Method: 正交蒙特卡洛Dropout，在组合稀疏语义向量时强制执行严格正交性，且不增加额外时间复杂度。

Result: 方法在理论和运行时层面保证合并LoRA保持正交，避免直接干扰，但实证显示正交性本身不足以实现语义解缠和组合性。

Conclusion: 仅靠LoRA间正交性可能不足以实现真正的语义组合性，需要重新审视其在适配器合并中的作用。

Abstract: We propose Orthogonal Monte Carlo Dropout, a mechanism that enforces strict
orthogonality when combining sparse semantic vectors without extra time
complexity. LoRA, a popular fine-tuning method for large models, typically
trains a module to represent a specific concept such as an object or a style.
When multiple LoRAs are merged, for example to generate an object in a
particular style, their semantic vectors may interfere with each other. Our
method guarantees, at the theoretical and runtime levels, that merged LoRAs
remain orthogonal and thus free from direct interference. However, empirical
analysis reveals that such orthogonality does not lead to the semantic
disentanglement or compositionality highlighted in prior work on compositional
adaptation. This finding suggests that inter-LoRA orthogonality alone may be
insufficient for achieving true semantic compositionality, prompting a
re-examination of its role in adapter merging.

Motivation: 现代文本到图像模型生成逼真图像的能力带来了被滥用以创建有害、欺骗性或非法内容的风险，这推动了机器遗忘领域的发展，但实际遗忘特定概念极其困难。

Method: 提出了记忆自我再生任务和MemoRa策略，这是一种支持有效恢复先前丢失知识的再生方法，并强调知识检索鲁棒性作为关键评估指标。

Result: 研究表明模型暴露于对抗性提示攻击时仍能生成所谓的未学习概念，遗忘以两种不同方式发生：短期遗忘可快速回忆，长期遗忘恢复更具挑战性。

Conclusion: 知识检索鲁棒性是开发更强大有效遗忘技术的关键但未被充分探索的评估指标，遗忘机制存在短期和长期两种不同模式。

Abstract: The impressive capability of modern text-to-image models to generate
realistic visuals has come with a serious drawback: they can be misused to
create harmful, deceptive or unlawful content. This has accelerated the push
for machine unlearning. This new field seeks to selectively remove specific
knowledge from a model's training data without causing a drop in its overall
performance. However, it turns out that actually forgetting a given concept is
an extremely difficult task. Models exposed to attacks using adversarial
prompts show the ability to generate so-called unlearned concepts, which can be
not only harmful but also illegal. In this paper, we present considerations
regarding the ability of models to forget and recall knowledge, introducing the
Memory Self-Regeneration task. Furthermore, we present MemoRa strategy, which
we consider to be a regenerative approach supporting the effective recovery of
previously lost knowledge. Moreover, we propose that robustness in knowledge
retrieval is a crucial yet underexplored evaluation measure for developing more
robust and effective unlearning techniques. Finally, we demonstrate that
forgetting occurs in two distinct ways: short-term, where concepts can be
quickly recalled, and long-term, where recovery is more challenging.

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了在LLM训练的不同阶段引入推理数据的影响，发现预训练阶段引入推理数据比后训练阶段更有效，能建立不可替代的基础能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于前沿模型的预训练语料库不透明，推理数据在不同训练阶段引入的效果尚不清楚，需要研究早期引入推理数据是否比后期引入更好，以及是否存在过拟合风险。

Method: 通过系统研究不同规模、多样性和质量的推理数据在训练不同阶段（预训练和后训练）对LLM性能的影响，分析数据分配的最佳策略。

Result: 预训练阶段引入推理数据至关重要（平均提升19%），建立了后期SFT无法完全复制的基础能力；预训练最受益于推理模式的多样性（平均提升11%），而SFT对数据质量更敏感（平均提升15%）。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了语言建模与推理的传统分离，为在整个训练流程中战略性分配数据提供了原则性指导，以构建更强大的模型。

Abstract: The prevailing paradigm for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs
revolves around post-training on high-quality, reasoning-intensive data. While
emerging literature suggests that reasoning data is increasingly incorporated
also during the mid-training stage-a practice that is relatively more
proprietary and less openly characterized-the role of such data in pretraining
remains unclear. In particular, due to the opaqueness of pretraining corpora in
most frontier models, the effect of reasoning data introduced at different
phases of pre- and/or post-training is relatively less reported in the
scientific literature. This raises several important questions: Is adding
reasoning data earlier during pretraining any better than introducing it during
post-training? Could earlier inclusion risk overfitting and harm
generalization, or instead establish durable foundations that later fine-tuning
cannot recover? We conduct the first systematic study of how reasoning
data-varying in scale, diversity, and quality-affects LLM performance when
introduced at different stages of training. We find that front-loading
reasoning data into pretraining is critical (19% avg gain), establishing
foundational capabilities that cannot be fully replicated by later-stage SFT,
even with more data. We uncover an asymmetric principle for optimal data
allocation: pretraining benefits most from broad diversity in reasoning
patterns (11% avg gain), while SFT is more sensitive to data quality (15% avg
gain). We show that high-quality pretraining data has latent effects, activated
only after SFT, and that naively scaling SFT data can be detrimental, washing
away the benefits of early reasoning injection. Our results challenge the
conventional separation of language modeling and reasoning, providing a
principled guide for strategically allocating data across the entire training
pipeline to build more capable models.

Motivation: 大规模基础模型在语言、视觉和推理任务中表现出色，但其内部如何组织和稳定概念仍不清楚。受因果推断启发，需要深入分析模型的概念表示。

Method: 使用谱分解在每层提取主方向，并将其连接成分支概念路径，构建概念树来重建概念的层次化涌现过程。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models demonstrate strong performance across language,
vision, and reasoning tasks. However, how they internally structure and
stabilize concepts remains elusive. Inspired by causal inference, we introduce
the MindCraft framework built upon Concept Trees. By applying spectral
decomposition at each layer and linking principal directions into branching
Concept Paths, Concept Trees reconstruct the hierarchical emergence of
concepts, revealing exactly when they diverge from shared representations into
linearly separable subspaces. Empirical evaluations across diverse scenarios
across disciplines, including medical diagnosis, physics reasoning, and
political decision-making, show that Concept Trees recover semantic
hierarchies, disentangle latent concepts, and can be widely applied across
multiple domains. The Concept Tree establishes a widely applicable and powerful
framework that enables in-depth analysis of conceptual representations in deep
models, marking a significant step forward in the foundation of interpretable
AI.

TL;DR: PT^2-LLM是一个专为大型语言模型设计的训练后三值化框架，通过非对称三值量化器和两阶段优化流程，在保持竞争力的性能下显著降低内存成本并加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然功能强大，但内存和计算需求巨大阻碍了部署。三值化作为一种有前景的压缩技术，在训练后量化场景中的潜力尚未充分探索，主要面临训练自由参数优化困难以及异常值和分散权重带来的量化挑战。

Method: 提出PT^2-LLM框架，核心是非对称三值量化器，包含两阶段优化：1）迭代三值拟合，交替进行最优三值网格构建和灵活舍入以最小化量化误差；2）激活感知网格对齐，进一步优化三值网格以更好匹配全精度输出。此外还提出基于结构相似性的重排序策略来缓解量化难度和异常值影响。

Result: 大量实验表明，PT^2-LLM在保持与最先进2位训练后量化方法竞争力的同时，具有更低的内存成本，并能加速预填充和解码过程，实现端到端加速。

Conclusion: PT^2-LLM为大型语言模型提供了一种有效的训练后三值化解决方案，在压缩和加速方面都取得了显著效果，为实际部署提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities across
diverse tasks, but their large memory and compute demands hinder deployment.
Ternarization has gained attention as a promising compression technique,
delivering substantial size reduction and high computational efficiency.
However, its potential in the post-training quantization (PTQ) setting remains
underexplored, due to the challenge of training-free parameter optimization and
the quantization difficulty posed by outliers and dispersed weights. To address
these issues, we propose PT$^2$-LLM, a post-training ternarization framework
tailored for LLMs. At its core is an Asymmetric Ternary Quantizer equipped with
a two-stage refinement pipeline: (1) Iterative Ternary Fitting (ITF), which
alternates between optimal ternary grid construction and flexible rounding to
minimize quantization error, and (2) Activation-aware Grid Alignment (AGA),
which further refines the ternary grid to better match full-precision outputs.
In addition, we propose a plug-and-play Structural Similarity-based Reordering
(SSR) strategy that leverages inter-column structural similarity to ease
quantization and mitigate outlier effects, further enhancing overall
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PT$^2$-LLM delivers
competitive performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) 2-bit PTQ methods with
lower memory cost, while also accelerating both prefill and decoding to achieve
end-to-end speedup. The code and models will be available at
https://github.com/XIANGLONGYAN/PT2-LLM.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个理论框架分析多模态对比学习的最优表示和模态对齐，证明维度崩溃是模态间隙的根本原因，并提出了两种实现完美对齐的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现多模态对比学习中不同模态的表示占据嵌入空间的不同区域（模态间隙现象），但关于模态间隙如何影响下游性能的研究结果不一致，需要从理论上解释模态间隙的成因和影响。

Method: 建立了理论分析框架，在不同约束条件下（无约束、锥约束、子空间约束）分析多模态对比学习的最优表示收敛性，证明维度崩溃导致模态间隙，并提出超平面旋转和共享空间投影两种对齐方法。

Result: 证明在无约束或锥约束下模态间隙收敛到零，在子空间约束下收敛到两个超平面间的最小角度；维度崩溃是模态间隙的根本原因；配对样本在子空间约束下无法完美对齐。

Conclusion: 模态间隙通过影响样本对的对齐来影响下游性能，通过超平面旋转和共享空间投影可以实现模态间的完美对齐，为理解多模态表示学习提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning (MCL) aims to embed data from different
modalities in a shared embedding space. However, empirical evidence shows that
representations from different modalities occupy completely separate regions of
embedding space, a phenomenon referred to as the modality gap. Moreover,
experimental findings on how the size of the modality gap influences downstream
performance are inconsistent. These observations raise two key questions: (1)
What causes the modality gap? (2) How does it affect downstream tasks? To
address these questions, this paper introduces the first theoretical framework
for analyzing the convergent optimal representations of MCL and the modality
alignment when training is optimized. Specifically, we prove that without any
constraint or under the cone constraint, the modality gap converges to zero.
Under the subspace constraint (i.e., representations of two modalities fall
into two distinct hyperplanes due to dimension collapse), the modality gap
converges to the smallest angle between the two hyperplanes. This result
identifies \emph{dimension collapse} as the fundamental origin of the modality
gap. Furthermore, our theorems demonstrate that paired samples cannot be
perfectly aligned under the subspace constraint. The modality gap influences
downstream performance by affecting the alignment between sample pairs. We
prove that, in this case, perfect alignment between two modalities can still be
achieved via two ways: hyperplane rotation and shared space projection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于KL或α-散度正则化的探索奖励方法在强化学习人类反馈中未能实现真正的乐观探索，反而偏向参考模型的高概率区域，限制了不确定区域的发现。

Method: 引入通用探索奖励(GEB)框架，通过参考依赖的奖励调节来抵消散度诱导的偏差，统一了先前的启发式奖励方法，并自然扩展到完整的α-散度族。

Result: 在多个散度设置和大语言模型骨干上的对齐任务中，GEB始终优于基线方法，证明了其有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: GEB为RLHF中的乐观探索提供了既有理论依据又实用的解决方案，能够显著提高样本效率。

Abstract: Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in
reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus
methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or
$\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward
high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing
conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To
address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel
theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB
counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation
and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally
across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently
outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings
and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers
both a principled and practical solution for optimistic exploration in RLHF.

Motivation: 分析大语言模型的决策边界对于理解模型核心属性和解释行为至关重要，但由于词汇序列规模巨大和自回归特性，构建主流LLMs的决策边界在计算上不可行。

Method: 提出决策势能面(DPS)概念，定义在区分不同采样序列的置信度上，捕捉决策边界的潜力。开发K-DPS算法，仅需K次有限序列采样来近似LLM的决策边界。

Result: 理论推导了K-DPS与理想DPS之间的绝对误差、期望误差和误差集中的上界，证明误差可以通过采样次数进行权衡。通过多个LLM和语料库的实验验证了结果。

Conclusion: DPS和K-DPS算法首次实现了大语言模型决策边界的近似构建，为分析LLM决策行为提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Decision boundary, the subspace of inputs where a machine learning model
assigns equal classification probabilities to two classes, is pivotal in
revealing core model properties and interpreting behaviors. While analyzing the
decision boundary of large language models (LLMs) has raised increasing
attention recently, constructing it for mainstream LLMs remains computationally
infeasible due to the enormous vocabulary-sequence sizes and the
auto-regressive nature of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper we propose
Decision Potential Surface (DPS), a new notion for analyzing LLM decision
boundary. DPS is defined on the confidences in distinguishing different
sampling sequences for each input, which naturally captures the potential of
decision boundary. We prove that the zero-height isohypse in DPS is equivalent
to the decision boundary of an LLM, with enclosed regions representing decision
regions. By leveraging DPS, for the first time in the literature, we propose an
approximate decision boundary construction algorithm, namely $K$-DPS, which
only requires K-finite times of sequence sampling to approximate an LLM's
decision boundary with negligible error. We theoretically derive the upper
bounds for the absolute error, expected error, and the error concentration
between K-DPS and the ideal DPS, demonstrating that such errors can be
trade-off with sampling times. Our results are empirically validated by
extensive experiments across various LLMs and corpora.

Motivation: Transformer架构在人工智能领域取得了革命性成功，但对其内部机制的理论理解仍然不足，需要建立更严谨的数学分析框架

Method: 提出将Transformer的离散分层结构映射为连续时空动力系统，将自注意力映射为非局部相互作用，前馈网络映射为局部反应，残差连接和层归一化映射为稳定机制

Result: 实验表明，没有残差连接会导致灾难性的表示漂移，没有层归一化会导致训练动态不稳定和爆炸性增长

Conclusion: 残差连接和层归一化这些看似启发式的技巧实际上是稳定原本强大但不稳定连续系统的基本数学稳定器

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet
a principled theoretical understanding of its internal mechanisms remains
elusive. This paper introduces a novel analytical framework that
reconceptualizes the Transformer's discrete, layered structure as a continuous
spatiotemporal dynamical system governed by a master Partial Differential
Equation (PDE). Within this paradigm, we map core architectural components to
distinct mathematical operators: self-attention as a non-local interaction, the
feed-forward network as a local reaction, and, critically, residual connections
and layer normalization as indispensable stabilization mechanisms. We do not
propose a new model, but rather employ the PDE system as a theoretical probe to
analyze the mathematical necessity of these components. By comparing a standard
Transformer with a PDE simulator that lacks explicit stabilizers, our
experiments provide compelling empirical evidence for our central thesis. We
demonstrate that without residual connections, the system suffers from
catastrophic representational drift, while the absence of layer normalization
leads to unstable, explosive training dynamics. Our findings reveal that these
seemingly heuristic "tricks" are, in fact, fundamental mathematical stabilizers
required to tame an otherwise powerful but inherently unstable continuous
system. This work offers a first-principles explanation for the Transformer's
design and establishes a new paradigm for analyzing deep neural networks
through the lens of continuous dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出Synergistic Information Distillation (SID)框架，通过将深度学习重构为局部协同优化问题，解决了反向传播的更新锁定和高内存消耗问题，实现了并行训练并保持前向推理不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决反向传播(BP)的两个关键可扩展性瓶颈：更新锁定（网络模块需等待整个反向传播完成）和因存储激活值导致的高内存消耗。

Method: 将深度网络构建为模块管道，每个模块具有局部目标来优化对真实目标的概率信念，平衡目标保真度和与前序模块信念的一致性，从而解耦模块间的反向依赖。

Result: 理论证明SID保证网络深度增加时的单调性能提升；实验表明SID在分类准确率上匹配或超越BP，具有更好的可扩展性和对标签噪声的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SID是一个可替代BP的通用训练框架，消除了更新锁定，大幅降低内存需求，同时保持标准前向推理过程。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP), while foundational to deep learning, imposes two
critical scalability bottlenecks: update locking, where network modules remain
idle until the entire backward pass completes, and high memory consumption due
to storing activations for gradient computation. To address these limitations,
we introduce Synergistic Information Distillation (SID), a novel training
framework that reframes deep learning as a cascade of local cooperative
refinement problems. In SID, a deep network is structured as a pipeline of
modules, each imposed with a local objective to refine a probabilistic belief
about the ground-truth target. This objective balances fidelity to the target
with consistency to the belief from its preceding module. By decoupling the
backward dependencies between modules, SID enables parallel training and hence
eliminates update locking and drastically reduces memory requirements.
Meanwhile, this design preserves the standard feed-forward inference pass,
making SID a versatile drop-in replacement for BP. We provide a theoretical
foundation, proving that SID guarantees monotonic performance improvement with
network depth. Empirically, SID consistently matches or surpasses the
classification accuracy of BP, exhibiting superior scalability and pronounced
robustness to label noise.Code is available at:

Conclusion: Quant-dLLM是针对扩散大语言模型的有效超低位量化框架，解决了标准量化方法不适用于掩码去噪激活模式的问题。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs), which offer bidirectional context
and flexible masked-denoising generation, are emerging as a compelling
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs. However, like AR LLMs, their model
sizes continue to grow, motivating weight compression for deployment. Although
post-training quantization (PTQ) is effective for AR LLMs, directly
transferring it to dLLMs at 2-bit leads to unsatisfactory performance. To
tackle these challenges, we propose Quant-dLLM, an ultra-low-bit PTQ framework
tailored to dLLMs. Since masked-denoising activations in dLLMs differ from the
fully visible signals assumed by standard PTQ methods, we introduce Masked
Calibration Simulation (MCS) to align calibration with the timestep-dependent
masking, which yields more reliable calibrations. Moreover, we propose a
Data-aware Any-order Quantizer (DAQ) that learns ultra-low-bit weight
representations via an optimization algorithm. It performs iterative
approximation guided by our simulated calibration data. In addition, under a
strict 2-bit budget, we introduce Adaptive Blockwise Mixed Precision (ABMP), a
sensitivity-based precision allocation scheme that adaptively assigns bit width
across channel groups. When restricted to 2-bit precision, Quant-dLLM
consistently achieves higher accuracy than state-of-the-art (SOTA) AR-transfer
PTQ methods on dLLMs. The code and models will be available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDQ-LLM是一种用于1位LLM的Sigma-Delta量化框架，通过过采样比率的连续可调性实现极低位量化，同时保持语言推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型面临显著的计算和内存挑战，极低位量化对于其高效部署至关重要。

Method: 使用上采样结合Sigma-Delta量化器将LLM权重二值化或三值化，采用Hadamard权重平滑减少量化精度损失，并提出细粒度的MultiOSR分配策略。

Result: 在OPT和LLaMA模型系列上的广泛实验表明，SDQ-LLM即使在高度激进的低OSR设置下也能实现更高效和高精度的性能。

Conclusion: SDQ-LLM框架为极低位LLM量化提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在模型大小和精度之间实现最佳权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory
challenges, making extremely low-bit quantization crucial for their efficient
deployment. In this work, we introduce SDQ-LLM: Sigma-Delta Quantization for
1-bit LLMs of any size, a novel framework that enables extremely low-bit
quantization of LLMs while preserving their linguistic reasoning capabilities.
A distinctive feature of SDQ-LLM is the continuous adjustability of the
Over-Sampling Ratio (OSR), enabling dynamic adaptation to memory or VRAM
constraints by selecting fractional OSR (e.g. 2.5 times) for an optimal
trade-off between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM uses upsampling combined
with Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLMs weights, encoding
high-precision parameters into 1-bit or 1.58-bit representations, replacing the
multiplication operations within linear layers with addition. This approach
significantly enhances inference efficiency under extremely low-bit
quantization. To further reduce the loss of quantization precision, we
incorporate Hadamard-based weight smoothing prior to quantization, improving
the stability and robustness of the weight representations. Furthermore, to
fully leverage the continuity of the OSR and reduce precision loss, recognizing
the correlation between quantization sensitivity and weight variance, we
propose a fine-grained, layer- and linear-wise OSR allocation strategy,
MultiOSR. This strategy distributes OSR both across layers and within each
layer, based on weight variance and parameter scale. Finally, extensive
experiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate that SDQ-LLM achieves a
more efficient and high-precision performance even under highly aggressive
low-OSR settings. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级二次增强器能有效提升神经网络性能，同时保持参数和计算效率。

Abstract: The combination of linear transformations and non-linear activation functions
forms the foundation of most modern deep neural networks, enabling them to
approximate highly complex functions. This paper explores the introduction of
quadratic transformations to further increase nonlinearity in neural networks,
with the aim of enhancing the performance of existing architectures. To reduce
parameter complexity and computational complexity, we propose a lightweight
quadratic enhancer that uses low-rankness, weight sharing, and sparsification
techniques. For a fixed architecture, the proposed approach introduces
quadratic interactions between features at every layer, while only adding
negligible amounts of additional model parameters and forward computations. We
conduct a set of proof-of-concept experiments for the proposed method across
three tasks: image classification, text classification, and fine-tuning
large-language models. In all tasks, the proposed approach demonstrates clear
and substantial performance gains.

Conclusion: 该方法为理解物理约束在贝叶斯物理信息神经网络中的影响提供了新的分析工具，有助于更准确地解释网络的不确定性。

Abstract: Bayesian physics-informed neural networks (B-PINNs) merge data with governing
equations to solve differential equations under uncertainty. However,
interpreting uncertainty and overconfidence in B-PINNs requires care due to the
poorly understood effects the physical constraints have on the network;
overconfidence could reflect warranted precision, enforced by the constraints,
rather than miscalibration. Motivated by the need to further clarify how
individual physical constraints shape these networks, we introduce a scalable,
matrix-free Laplace framework that decomposes the posterior Hessian into
contributions from each constraint and provides metrics to quantify their
relative influence on the loss landscape. Applied to the Van der Pol equation,
our method tracks how constraints sculpt the network's geometry and shows,
directly through the Hessian, how changing a single loss weight non-trivially
redistributes curvature and effective dominance across the others.

Motivation: 现有方法在长序列建模中存在效率与内存的权衡：RNN存在梯度消失/爆炸问题，Transformer受限于二次复杂度，Mamba虽然高效但长程记忆呈指数衰减

Method: 通过数学推导和信息论分析揭示Mamba记忆衰减机制，提出水平-垂直记忆保真度指标，引入状态摘要机制和跨层跨token注意力架构

Result: 在PG19和Passkey Retrieval等长序列基准测试中显著优于现有Mamba变体和Transformer，推理效率提升48%

Conclusion: MemMamba在复杂度-内存权衡上实现突破，为超长序列建模提供了新范式

Abstract: With the explosive growth of data, long-sequence modeling has become
increasingly important in tasks such as natural language processing and
bioinformatics. However, existing methods face inherent trade-offs between
efficiency and memory. Recurrent neural networks suffer from gradient vanishing
and explosion, making them hard to scale. Transformers can model global
dependencies but are constrained by quadratic complexity. Recently, selective
state-space models such as Mamba have demonstrated high efficiency with O(n)
time and O(1) recurrent inference, yet their long-range memory decays
exponentially. In this work, we conduct mathematical derivations and
information-theoretic analysis to systematically uncover the memory decay
mechanism of Mamba, answering a fundamental question: what is the nature of
Mamba's long-range memory and how does it retain information? To quantify key
information loss, we further introduce horizontal-vertical memory fidelity
metrics that capture degradation both within and across layers. Inspired by how
humans distill and retain salient information when reading long documents, we
propose MemMamba, a novel architectural framework that integrates state
summarization mechanism together with cross-layer and cross-token attention,
which alleviates long-range forgetting while preserving linear complexity.
MemMamba achieves significant improvements over existing Mamba variants and
Transformers on long-sequence benchmarks such as PG19 and Passkey Retrieval,
while delivering a 48% speedup in inference efficiency. Both theoretical
analysis and empirical results demonstrate that MemMamba achieves a
breakthrough in the complexity-memory trade-off, offering a new paradigm for
ultra-long sequence modeling.

TL;DR: MACE是一个混合LLM系统，通过在边缘服务器上协同部署推理和微调任务，实现迭代级调度，在保证推理延迟的同时提升模型更新频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘服务器上部署的LLM在延迟敏感应用中面临频繁重训练需求，但现有策略无法在有限GPU资源下平衡推理延迟和模型准确性。

Method: 提出MACE系统，采用协同推理（预填充、解码）和微调的混合架构，结合智能内存管理，根据模型更新对输出对齐的影响程度分配GPU周期。

Result: 在跟踪驱动评估中，MACE相比连续重训练减少推理延迟达63%，同时保持吞吐量，在NVIDIA AGX Orin上维持85%以上的GPU利用率。

Conclusion: 迭代级混合调度是在边缘平台上部署具有持续学习能力的LLM的有前景方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deployed on edge servers are increasingly used
in latency-sensitive applications such as personalized assistants,
recommendation, and content moderation. However, the non-stationary nature of
user data necessitates frequent retraining, which introduces a fundamental
tension between inference latency and model accuracy under constrained GPU
resources. Existing retraining strategies either delay model updates,
over-commit resources to retraining, or overlook iteration-level retraining
granularity. In this paper, we identify that iteration-level scheduling is
crucial for adapting retraining frequency to model drift without violating
service-level objectives (SLOs). We propose MACE, a hybrid LLM system that
colocates concurrent inference (prefill, decode) and fine-tuning, with
intelligent memory management to maximize task performance while promising
inference throughput. MACE leverages the insight that not all model updates
equally affect output alignment and allocates GPU cycles accordingly to balance
throughput, latency, and update freshness. Our trace-driven evaluation shows
that MACE matches or exceeds continuous retraining while reducing inference
latency by up to 63% and maintaining throughput under resource constraints.
Compared to periodic retraining, MACE improves latency breakdown across
prefill, decode, and finetune stages, and sustains GPU utilization above 85% in
NVIDIA AGX Orin. These results demonstrate that iteration-level hybrid
scheduling is a promising direction for deploying LLMs with continual learning
capabilities on edge platforms.

Abstract: This paper proposes Edge-FIT (Federated Instruction Tuning on the Edge), a
scalable framework for Federated Instruction Tuning (FIT) of Large Language

when confronted with the massive parameter size of LLMs [3], [6]. Our Edge-FIT
framework combines federated learning with 4-bit Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLORA), mitigating the core issues of communication and computational
overhead. We demonstrate this by filtering the general-purpose Databricks Dolly
15k dataset for the IoT domain. Experimental results show the Edge-FIT tuned
Llama 2(7B) achieves an F1-Score of 0.89. We also demonstrate a viable
trade-off using the 3.8B Phi-3-mini model, validating Edge-FIT as a scalable
framework for decentralized LLM deployment on home compute gateways.

Conclusion: LogAction通过主动领域自适应有效解决了日志异常检测中的标注依赖和数据分布差异问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Log-based anomaly detection is a essential task for ensuring the reliability
and performance of software systems. However, the performance of existing
anomaly detection methods heavily relies on labeling, while labeling a large
volume of logs is highly challenging. To address this issue, many approaches
based on transfer learning and active learning have been proposed.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness is hindered by issues such as the gap between
source and target system data distributions and cold-start problems. In this
paper, we propose LogAction, a novel log-based anomaly detection model based on
active domain adaptation. LogAction integrates transfer learning and active
learning techniques. On one hand, it uses labeled data from a mature system to
train a base model, mitigating the cold-start issue in active learning. On the
other hand, LogAction utilize free energy-based sampling and uncertainty-based
sampling to select logs located at the distribution boundaries for manual
labeling, thus addresses the data distribution gap in transfer learning with
minimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on six different
combinations of datasets demonstrate that LogAction achieves an average 93.01%
F1 score with only 2% of manual labels, outperforming some state-of-the-art
methods by 26.28%. Website: https://logaction.github.io

Abstract: The main advantages of diffusion language models over autoregressive (AR)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型面临高昂的计算和内存成本，现有剪枝方法难以平衡效率和鲁棒性：局部方法在高稀疏度下容易崩溃，而全局方法需要昂贵的权重更新或限制半结构化格式。

Method: 使用快速层间评分和轻量级全局控制器分配单一稀疏度预算，支持非结构化和半结构化N:M剪枝，通过镜像下降优化实现全局协调。

Result: 在多个预训练LLM家族和标准基准测试中，UniPruning始终提供竞争性或更优的困惑度和零样本准确率。

Conclusion: UniPruning为大规模LLM稀疏化提供了一个高效、有原则且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks
but face prohibitive computational and memory costs. Pruning offers a promising
path by inducing sparsity while preserving architectural flexibility. However,
existing methods struggle to balance efficiency and robustness: local metric
approaches prune layer by layer but often collapse under high sparsity, whereas
global feedback methods enforce consistency at the cost of expensive weight
updates or restrictive semi-structured formats. We present UniPruning, a
unified post-training pruning framework that combines the speed of local
saliency metrics with the stability of global coordination, enabled by a mirror
descent based optimization, all without updating model weights. UniPruning
leverages fast layer-wise scoring and a lightweight global controller to
allocate a single sparsity budget, supporting both unstructured and
semi-structured N :M pruning within one framework. After a brief calibration,
it can generate pruning masks for arbitrary sparsity levels in one shot, and
adapts seamlessly to hardware-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on
multiple pretrained LLM families and standard benchmarks show that UniPruning
consistently delivers competitive or superior perplexity and zero-shot
accuracy. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of mirror descent
and local saliency anchoring. Overall, UniPruning provides an efficient,
principled, and scalable solution for sparsifying large-scale LLMs. Our code is

TL;DR: LASER是一种即插即用的推理时路由算法，通过平衡负载来改善MoE模型的系统性能，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型通过条件路由减少训练成本，但在推理时会导致专家负载不均衡，从而影响延迟、吞吐量和成本。

Method: LASER根据门控分数分布自适应路由：当分数有明显偏好时路由到最强专家；当分数均匀时扩展到更多可行专家并路由到负载最轻的专家。

Result: 在Mixtral-8x7B和DeepSeek-MoE-16b-chat上的评估显示，LASER改善了负载平衡，降低了延迟并提高了吞吐量，同时准确率变化可忽略。

Conclusion: LASER无需重新训练或微调即可集成到现有MoE推理流程中，有效解决了推理时的负载不均衡问题。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models can scale parameter capacity by routing each
token to a subset of experts through a learned gate function. While conditional
routing reduces training costs, it shifts the burden on inference memory:
expert parameters and activations consume memory, limiting the number of
experts per device. As tokens are routed, some experts become overloaded while
others are underutilized. Because experts are mapped to GPUs, this imbalance
translates directly into degraded system performance in terms of latency,
throughput, and cost. We present LASER, a plug-and-play, inference-time routing
algorithm that balances load while preserving accuracy. LASER adapts to the
shape of the gate's score distribution. When scores provide a clear preference,
it routes to the strongest experts; when scores are more uniform, it broadens
the set of viable experts and routes to the least-loaded among them. Because
LASER relies only on gate scores from a trained model, it integrates directly
into existing MoE inference pipelines without retraining or finetuning. We
evaluate LASER on Mixtral-8x7B and DeepSeek-MoE-16b-chat across four datasets
(ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and GSM8K). LASER improves load balancing,
translating into lower latency and higher throughput, while keeping the
accuracy changes negligible.

Method: 使用9个已发表的行为运营实验，评估假设检验结果复现和分布对齐（Wasserstein距离），测试思维链提示和超参数调优两种干预

Result: LLMs能复现大部分假设级效应，捕捉关键决策偏差，但响应分布与人类数据存在差异，轻量级干预可减少不对齐并让小模型达到或超越大模型性能

Abstract: LLMs are emerging tools for simulating human behavior in business, economics,
and social science, offering a lower-cost complement to laboratory experiments,
field studies, and surveys. This paper evaluates how well LLMs replicate human
behavior in operations management. Using nine published experiments in
behavioral operations, we assess two criteria: replication of hypothesis-test
outcomes and distributional alignment via Wasserstein distance. LLMs reproduce
most hypothesis-level effects, capturing key decision biases, but their
response distributions diverge from human data, including for strong commercial
models. We also test two lightweight interventions -- chain-of-thought
prompting and hyperparameter tuning -- which reduce misalignment and can
sometimes let smaller or open-source models match or surpass larger systems.

Motivation: 虽然Transformer模型已成为序列建模的主流架构，但文献主要关注注意力机制，而池化操作作为将token表示聚合成固定大小向量的关键组件，其作用尚未得到充分探索，尽管它对模型行为有重要影响。

Method: 建立理论框架来严格表征配备常用池化方法的Transformer模型的表达能力，推导其表示容量和区分相似输入能力的闭式界限，并在计算机视觉、自然语言处理和时间序列分析三个主要模态上实证评估不同池化策略。

Conclusion: 本研究统一了理论和实证视角，为针对特定任务选择或设计池化机制提供了实用指导，将池化定位为Transformer模型中的关键架构组件，并为超越仅关注注意力的更原则性模型设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: Transformer models have become the dominant backbone for sequence modeling,
leveraging self-attention to produce contextualized token representations.
These are typically aggregated into fixed-size vectors via pooling operations
for downstream tasks. While much of the literature has focused on attention
mechanisms, the role of pooling remains underexplored despite its critical
impact on model behavior. In this paper, we introduce a theoretical framework
that rigorously characterizes the expressivity of Transformer-based models
equipped with widely used pooling methods by deriving closed-form bounds on
their representational capacity and the ability to distinguish similar inputs.
Our analysis extends to different variations of attention formulations,
demonstrating that these bounds hold across diverse architectural variants. We
empirically evaluate pooling strategies across tasks requiring both global and
local contextual understanding, spanning three major modalities: computer
vision, natural language processing, and time-series analysis. Results reveal
consistent trends in how pooling choices affect accuracy, sensitivity, and
optimization behavior. Our findings unify theoretical and empirical
perspectives, providing practical guidance for selecting or designing pooling
mechanisms suited to specific tasks. This work positions pooling as a key
architectural component in Transformer models and lays the foundation for more
principled model design beyond attention alone.

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic underscored a critical need for intervention strategies
that balance disease containment with socioeconomic stability. We approach this
challenge by designing a framework for modeling and evaluating disease-spread
prevention strategies. Our framework leverages multi-objective reinforcement
learning (MORL) - a formulation necessitated by competing objectives - combined
with a new stochastic differential equation (SDE) pandemic simulator,
calibrated and validated against global COVID-19 data. Our simulator reproduces
national-scale pandemic dynamics with orders of magnitude higher fidelity than
other models commonly used in reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to
pandemic intervention. Training a Pareto-Conditioned Network (PCN) agent on
this simulator, we illustrate the direct policy trade-offs between
epidemiological control and economic stability for COVID-19. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the framework's generality by extending it to pathogens with
different epidemiological profiles, such as polio and influenza, and show how
these profiles lead the agent to discover fundamentally different intervention
policies. To ground our work in contemporary policymaking challenges, we apply
the model to measles outbreaks, quantifying how a modest 5% drop in vaccination
coverage necessitates significantly more stringent and costly interventions to
curb disease spread. This work provides a robust and adaptable framework to
support transparent, evidence-based policymaking for mitigating public health
crises.

Motivation: 随着航空业快速发展，需要大量飞行员，如何以成本效益高的方式选拔合适的飞行员成为重要研究问题。

Method: 招募23名中国东方航空飞行员和23名清华大学新手，应用结合机器学习和VR技术的新方法，使用SVM分类器和MIC特征选择方法分析眼动追踪和飞行动力学数据。

Result: SVM与MIC特征选择方法在所有指标上均取得最高预测性能：准确率0.93、AUC 0.96、F1分数0.93，优于其他四种分类器算法和两种特征选择方法。

Conclusion: SVM+MIC算法优于现有所有飞行员选拔算法，可能是首个基于眼动追踪和飞行动力学数据的实现，该研究的VR模拟平台和算法可用于飞行员选拔和训练。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the aviation industry, there is a need for a large
number of flight crew. How to select the right pilots in a cost-efficient
manner has become an important research question. In the current study,
twenty-three pilots were recruited from China Eastern Airlines, and 23 novices
were from the community of Tsinghua University. A novel approach incorporating
machine learning and virtual reality technology was applied to distinguish
features between these participants with different flight skills. Results
indicate that SVM with the MIC feature selection method consistently achieved
the highest prediction performance on all metrics with an Accuracy of 0.93, an
AUC of 0.96, and an F1 of 0.93, which outperforms four other classifier
algorithms and two other feature selection methods. From the perspective of
feature selection methods, the MIC method can select features with a nonlinear
relationship to sampling labels, instead of a simple filter-out. Our new
implementation of the SVM + MIC algorithm outperforms all existing pilot
selection algorithms and perhaps provides the first implementation based on eye
tracking and flight dynamics data. This study's VR simulation platforms and
algorithms can be used for pilot selection and training.

TL;DR: AgentCaster是一个用于龙卷风预测的多模态LLM框架，通过评估LLM在复杂真实世界任务中的表现，发现人类专家显著优于最先进模型，后者存在幻觉、风险强度过度预测和时空推理困难等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在复杂、高影响真实世界任务中的真实推理能力，填补现有评估方法的空白，特别是在关键领域如龙卷风预测中的表现。

Method: 使用多模态LLM端到端处理高分辨率对流允许预报档案中的异构时空数据，在40天期间交互查询3,625个预报地图和40,125个预报探空数据，生成12-36小时的概率性龙卷风风险多边形预测。

Result: 人类专家显著优于最先进模型，模型存在强烈幻觉倾向、风险强度过度预测、地理定位不准确，在复杂动态演化系统中时空推理能力差。提出了领域特定的TornadoBench和TornadoHallucination指标。

Conclusion: AgentCaster旨在推动改进LLM代理在关键领域挑战性推理任务中的研究，当前LLM在复杂真实世界任务中的表现仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: There is a growing need to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex,
high-impact, real-world tasks to assess their true readiness as reasoning
agents. To address this gap, we introduce AgentCaster, a contamination-free
framework employing multimodal LLMs end-to-end for the challenging,
long-horizon task of tornado forecasting. Within AgentCaster, models interpret
heterogeneous spatiotemporal data from a high-resolution convection-allowing
forecast archive. We assess model performance over a 40-day period featuring
diverse historical data, spanning several major tornado outbreaks and including
over 500 tornado reports. Each day, models query interactively from a pool of
3,625 forecast maps and 40,125 forecast soundings for a forecast horizon of
12-36 hours. Probabilistic tornado-risk polygon predictions are verified
against ground truths derived from geometric comparisons across disjoint risk
bands in projected coordinate space. To quantify accuracy, we propose
domain-specific TornadoBench and TornadoHallucination metrics, with
TornadoBench highly challenging for both LLMs and domain expert human
forecasters. Notably, human experts significantly outperform state-of-the-art
models, which demonstrate a strong tendency to hallucinate and overpredict risk
intensity, struggle with precise geographic placement, and exhibit poor
spatiotemporal reasoning in complex, dynamically evolving systems. AgentCaster
aims to advance research on improving LLM agents for challenging reasoning
tasks in critical domains.

TL;DR: CONCEPTNEURO是一个基于概念的精神障碍诊断框架，利用大语言模型和神经生物学知识自动生成可解释的功能连接概念，通过概念分类器实现透明诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近五分之一的青少年患有精神或行为健康问题，需要开发准确且可解释的诊断工具。现有的图神经网络方法虽然有效但缺乏可解释性，限制了临床应用的可靠性。

Method: 结合大语言模型和神经生物学领域知识，自动生成、筛选和编码可解释的功能连接概念，每个概念表示为连接特定脑区的结构化子图，通过概念分类器进行预测。

Result: 在多个精神障碍数据集上的实验表明，CONCEPTNEURO增强的图神经网络始终优于原始版本，在提高准确性的同时提供透明、临床对齐的解释。

Conclusion: CONCEPTNEURO建立了基于概念的可解释诊断框架，概念分析揭示了与专家知识一致且具有新假设价值的障碍特异性连接模式。

Abstract: Nearly one in five adolescents currently live with a diagnosed mental or
behavioral health condition, such as anxiety, depression, or conduct disorder,
underscoring the urgency of developing accurate and interpretable diagnostic
tools. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provides a
powerful lens into large-scale functional connectivity, where brain regions are
modeled as nodes and inter-regional synchrony as edges, offering clinically
relevant biomarkers for psychiatric disorders. While prior works use graph
neural network (GNN) approaches for disorder prediction, they remain complex
black-boxes, limiting their reliability and clinical translation. In this work,
we propose CONCEPTNEURO, a concept-based diagnosis framework that leverages
large language models (LLMs) and neurobiological domain knowledge to
automatically generate, filter, and encode interpretable functional
connectivity concepts. Each concept is represented as a structured subgraph
linking specific brain regions, which are then passed through a concept
classifier. Our design ensures predictions through clinically meaningful
connectivity patterns, enabling both interpretability and strong predictive
performance. Extensive experiments across multiple psychiatric disorder
datasets demonstrate that CONCEPTNEURO-augmented GNNs consistently outperform
their vanilla counterparts, improving accuracy while providing transparent,
clinically aligned explanations. Furthermore, concept analyses highlight
disorder-specific connectivity patterns that align with expert knowledge and
suggest new hypotheses for future investigation, establishing CONCEPTNEURO as
an interpretable, domain-informed framework for psychiatric disorder diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在不同模态间的原理迁移不完美，特别是时间序列数据与文本或视觉数据在结构特性上差异显著，需要专门分析时间序列Transformer的秩结构特性。

Method: 通过秩结构分析时间序列嵌入的奇异值谱特性，证明Q/K/V投影的低秩近似可行性，提出流秩概念解释非线性混合导致的秩膨胀现象，并基于这些发现进行模型压缩。

Result: 时间序列嵌入具有急剧衰减的奇异值谱，注意力层可压缩程度与嵌入谱衰减成正比。成功压缩Chronos模型，实现65%推理时间减少和81%内存节省，且无精度损失。

Conclusion: 时间序列基础模型具有内在可压缩性，研究结果为时间序列基础模型的宽度、深度和注意力头分配提供了原则性指导，并揭示了利用其固有可压缩性的方法。

Abstract: Transformers are widely used across data modalities, and yet the principles
distilled from text models often transfer imperfectly to models trained to
other modalities. In this paper, we analyze Transformers through the lens of
rank structure. Our focus is on the time series setting, where the structural
properties of the data differ remarkably from those of text or vision. We show
that time-series embeddings, unlike text or vision, exhibit sharply decaying
singular value spectra: small patch sizes and smooth continuous mappings
concentrate the data into low-rank subspaces. From this, we prove that the
associated $Q/K/V$ projections admit accurate low-rank approximations, and that
attention layers become compressible in proportion to the decay of the
embedding spectrum. We introduce the concept of flow-of-ranks, a phenomenon by
which nonlinear mixing across depth inflates the rank, explaining why early
layers are most amenable to compression and why ranks grow with depth. Guided
by these theoretical and empirical results, we use these insights to compress
Chronos, a large time series foundation model, achieving a reduction of $65\%$
in inference time and $81\%$ in memory, without loss of accuracy. Our findings
provide principled guidance for allocating width, depth, and heads in time
series foundation models, and for exploiting their inherent compressibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数值评估湍流控制对壁面摩擦的影响需要昂贵的湍流流体动力学模拟，因此需要开发更高效的建模和控制方法。

Method: 使用基于模型的强化学习进行预测控制，通过物理信息神经算子(PINO)联合学习湍流控制的策略和观测器模型，PINO具有离散化不变性并能准确捕捉湍流中的精细尺度。

Result: PINO-PC在多种具有挑战性的高雷诺数未见湍流场景中优于先前的无模型强化学习方法，在雷诺数为15,000时实现39.0%的减阻效果。

Conclusion: PINO-PC框架在湍流控制方面表现出色，特别是在处理高雷诺数和未见流动场景时，显著优于现有流体控制方法。

Abstract: Assessing turbulence control effects for wall friction numerically is a
significant challenge since it requires expensive simulations of turbulent
fluid dynamics. We instead propose an efficient deep reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for modeling and control of turbulent flows. It is model-based
RL for predictive control (PC), where both the policy and the observer models
for turbulence control are learned jointly using Physics Informed Neural
Operators (PINO), which are discretization invariant and can capture fine
scales in turbulent flows accurately. Our PINO-PC outperforms prior model-free
reinforcement learning methods in various challenging scenarios where the flows
are of high Reynolds numbers and unseen, i.e., not provided during model
training. We find that PINO-PC achieves a drag reduction of 39.0\% under a
bulk-velocity Reynolds number of 15,000, outperforming previous fluid control
methods by more than 32\%.

TL;DR: WindSR是一种用于轮毂高度风速超分辨率降尺度的扩散模型，通过数据同化将稀疏观测数据与模拟场结合，提供高质量的高分辨率风速数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的轮毂高度风速观测数据在空间和时间上都很稀疏，而模拟数据虽然广泛可用但存在偏差且分辨率不足，无法满足风电场选址或极端天气风险评估的需求。

Method: 采用扩散模型结合数据同化方法，引入动态半径融合技术将观测数据与模拟场融合，并在训练和推理过程中纳入地形信息作为风的关键驱动因素。

Result: 与卷积神经网络和生成对抗网络基线相比，WindSR在降尺度效率和准确性方面表现更优，数据同化使模型偏差相对于独立观测减少了约20%。

Conclusion: WindSR成功整合了观测和模拟数据，为轮毂高度风速提供了高质量的高分辨率估计，在风能应用和风险评估方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: High-quality observations of hub-height winds are valuable but sparse in
space and time. Simulations are widely available on regular grids but are
generally biased and too coarse to inform wind-farm siting or to assess
extreme-weather-related risks (e.g., gusts) at infrastructure scales. To fully
utilize both data types for generating high-quality, high-resolution hub-height
wind speeds (tens to ~100m above ground), this study introduces WindSR, a
diffusion model with data assimilation for super-resolution downscaling of
hub-height winds. WindSR integrates sparse observational data with simulation
fields during downscaling using state-of-the-art diffusion models. A
dynamic-radius blending method is introduced to merge observations with
simulations, providing conditioning for the diffusion process. Terrain
information is incorporated during both training and inference to account for
its role as a key driver of winds. Evaluated against
convolutional-neural-network and generative-adversarial-network baselines,
WindSR outperforms them in both downscaling efficiency and accuracy. Our data
assimilation reduces WindSR's model bias by approximately 20% relative to
independent observations.

<details>

Motivation: 区分记忆和推理能力对于预测模型泛化、设计针对性评估以及构建更安全的干预措施至关重要，但目前尚不清楚这两种能力是否依赖不同的内部机制。

Method: 使用合成语言谜题数据集，结合激活修补和结构化消融方法，在层、头和神经元层面探测Transformer模型，因果测量各组件对每种任务类型的贡献。

Result: 在两个模型家族（Qwen和LLaMA）中，对特定层和注意力头的干预导致选择性损伤：禁用"记忆电路"使事实检索准确率降低达15%而推理能力保持完整，禁用"推理电路"使多步推理能力降低类似幅度。

Conclusion: 研究提供了首个因果证据表明记忆和推理在Transformer模型中依赖于可分离但相互作用的电路，这些发现通过将电路级结构与功能专业化联系起来推进了机制可解释性研究。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models excel at both recall (retrieving memorized
facts) and reasoning (performing multi-step inference), but whether these
abilities rely on distinct internal mechanisms remains unclear. Distinguishing
recall from reasoning is crucial for predicting model generalization, designing
targeted evaluations, and building safer interventions that affect one ability
without disrupting the other.We approach this question through mechanistic
interpretability, using controlled datasets of synthetic linguistic puzzles to
probe transformer models at the layer, head, and neuron level. Our pipeline
combines activation patching and structured ablations to causally measure
component contributions to each task type. Across two model families (Qwen and
LLaMA), we find that interventions on distinct layers and attention heads lead
to selective impairments: disabling identified "recall circuits" reduces
fact-retrieval accuracy by up to 15\% while leaving reasoning intact, whereas
disabling "reasoning circuits" reduces multi-step inference by a comparable
margin. At the neuron level, we observe task-specific firing patterns, though
these effects are less robust, consistent with neuronal polysemanticity.Our
results provide the first causal evidence that recall and reasoning rely on
separable but interacting circuits in transformer models. These findings
advance mechanistic interpretability by linking circuit-level structure to
functional specialization and demonstrate how controlled datasets and causal
interventions can yield mechanistic insights into model cognition, informing
safer deployment of large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少对高带宽互联的依赖，使得能够在分布式计算资源上训练大模型，而不是仅限于数据中心。

Method: 将优化器动量视为信号，通过离散余弦变换将Nesterov动量分解为高低频分量，每H步仅同步高频分量，结合不频繁的模型副本同步。

Result: 相比基线DiLoCo实现了高达16倍的通信减少，在transformer语言模型和卷积神经网络上均表现良好。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了在低带宽互联的分布式节点上训练大模型的可行性。

Abstract: The training of large models demands substantial computational resources,
typically available only in data centers with high-bandwidth interconnects.
However, reducing the reliance on high-bandwidth interconnects between nodes
enables the use of distributed compute resources as an alternative to
centralized data center training. Building on recent advances in distributed
model training, we propose an approach that further reduces communication by
combining infrequent synchronizations across distributed model replicas with
gradient momentum compression. In particular, we treat the optimizer momentum
as a signal and decompose the Nesterov momentum into high- and low-frequency
components via the discrete cosine transform (DCT). Only the high-frequency
components are synchronized across model replicas every $H$ steps. Empirically,
our method achieves up to a $16\times$ reduction in communication compared to
the baseline DiLoCo, and it generalizes across architectures, including
transformer-based language models and convolutional neural networks for images.
Overall, this work advances the feasibility of training large models on
distributed nodes with low-bandwidth interconnects.

Motivation: 联邦学习中的非独立同分布数据，特别是数量倾斜问题，对模型性能造成严重挑战。现有聚类联邦学习方法缺乏在数量倾斜场景下的系统性评估，且难以有效应对该问题。

Method: 提出CORNFLQS算法，将两种CFL操作策略（客户端选择最小化本地训练损失的集群，服务器基于本地模型相似性分组客户端）进行最优协调，形成迭代优化过程。

Result: 在6个图像分类数据集上的270个非独立同分布配置实验中，CORNFLQS在准确率和聚类质量方面均获得最高平均排名，对数量倾斜扰动表现出强鲁棒性，优于现有CFL算法。

Conclusion: CORNFLQS算法通过协调两种CFL策略，有效解决了联邦学习中的数量倾斜问题，在多个数据集上展现出优越的性能和鲁棒性，为处理非独立同分布数据提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a decentralized paradigm that enables a
client-server architecture to collaboratively train a global Artificial
Intelligence model without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy. A key
challenge in FL is Non-IID data. Quantity Skew (QS) is a particular problem of
Non-IID, where clients hold highly heterogeneous data volumes. Clustered
Federated Learning (CFL) is an emergent variant of FL that presents a promising
solution to Non-IID problem. It improves models' performance by grouping
clients with similar data distributions into clusters. CFL methods generally
fall into two operating strategies. In the first strategy, clients select the
cluster that minimizes the local training loss. In the second strategy, the
server groups clients based on local model similarities. However, most CFL
methods lack systematic evaluation under QS but present significant challenges
because of it. In this paper, we present two main contributions. The first one
is an evaluation of state-of-the-art CFL algorithms under various Non-IID
settings, applying multiple QS scenarios to assess their robustness. Our second
contribution is a novel iterative CFL algorithm, named CORNFLQS, which proposes
an optimal coordination between both operating strategies of CFL. Our approach
is robust against the different variations of QS settings. We conducted
intensive experiments on six image classification datasets, resulting in 270
Non-IID configurations. The results show that CORNFLQS achieves the highest
average ranking in both accuracy and clustering quality, as well as strong
robustness to QS perturbations. Overall, our approach outperforms actual CFL
algorithms.

Motivation: 高速公路互通立交是车辆转换的关键节点，但缺乏实时匝道检测器导致交通预测存在盲区

Result: 在三个真实世界互通立交数据集上的实验表明，STDAE-GWNET持续优于13个最先进基线，性能接近使用历史匝道数据的模型

Conclusion: STDAE能有效克服检测器稀缺问题，具有即插即用潜力，可应用于多种预测管道

Abstract: Interchanges are crucial nodes for vehicle transfers between highways, yet
the lack of real-time ramp detectors creates blind spots in traffic prediction.
To address this, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Decoupled Autoencoder (STDAE), a
two-stage framework that leverages cross-modal reconstruction pretraining. In
the first stage, STDAE reconstructs historical ramp flows from mainline data,
forcing the model to capture intrinsic spatio-temporal relations. Its decoupled
architecture with parallel spatial and temporal autoencoders efficiently
extracts heterogeneous features. In the prediction stage, the learned
representations are integrated with models such as GWNet to enhance accuracy.
Experiments on three real-world interchange datasets show that STDAE-GWNET
consistently outperforms thirteen state-of-the-art baselines and achieves
performance comparable to models using historical ramp data. This demonstrates
its effectiveness in overcoming detector scarcity and its plug-and-play
potential for diverse forecasting pipelines.

Method: 应用神经扩散过程(NDPs)并扩展为多任务NDP框架，引入任务编码器捕捉跨风机相关性，支持对未见风机的少样本适应。

Result: MT-NDP框架在点精度和校准方面优于单任务NDPs和高斯过程，特别对于行为偏离平均值的风机表现更好，提供更尖锐但可信的预测区间。

Conclusion: 基于NDP的模型提供校准且可扩展的预测，适合运营部署，能够支持现代风电场的调度和维护决策。

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware wind power prediction is essential for grid integration and
reliable wind farm operation. We apply neural diffusion processes (NDPs)-a
recent class of models that learn distributions over functions-and extend them
to a multi-task NDP (MT-NDP) framework for wind power prediction. We provide
the first empirical evaluation of NDPs in real supervisory control and data
acquisition (SCADA) data. We introduce a task encoder within MT-NDPs to capture
cross-turbine correlations and enable few-shot adaptation to unseen turbines.
The proposed MT-NDP framework outperforms single-task NDPs and GPs in terms of
point accuracy and calibration, particularly for wind turbines whose behaviour
deviates from the fleet average. In general, NDP-based models deliver
calibrated and scalable predictions suitable for operational deployment,
offering sharper, yet trustworthy, predictive intervals that can support
dispatch and maintenance decisions in modern wind farms.

Motivation: 深度学习、金融等领域需要对长序列实数进行复合计算，传统方法容易导致灾难性的数值下溢或上溢问题，限制了计算的动态范围和稳定性。

Method: 引入广义数量级(GOOMs)概念，实现自定义并行前缀扫描算法，支持在GPU等并行硬件上的原生执行。

Result: 在三个代表性实验中表现出色：超越标准浮点数限制的实数矩阵乘积复合计算；并行估计Lyapunov指数谱，速度比先前方法快数个数量级；在深度循环神经网络中捕获长程依赖关系，无需任何稳定化处理。

Conclusion: GOOMs结合高效并行扫描为高动态范围应用提供了可扩展且数值稳健的替代方案，优于传统浮点数方法。

Abstract: Many domains, from deep learning to finance, require compounding real numbers
over long sequences, often leading to catastrophic numerical underflow or
overflow. We introduce generalized orders of magnitude (GOOMs), a principled
extension of traditional orders of magnitude that incorporates floating-point
numbers as a special case, and which in practice enables stable computation
over significantly larger dynamic ranges of real numbers than previously
possible. We implement GOOMs, along with an efficient custom parallel prefix
scan, to support native execution on parallel hardware such as GPUs. We
demonstrate that our implementation of GOOMs outperforms traditional approaches
with three representative experiments, all of which were previously considered
impractical or impossible, and now become possible and practical: (1)
compounding real matrix products far beyond standard floating-point limits; (2)
estimating spectra of Lyapunov exponents in parallel, orders of magnitude
faster than with previous methods, applying a novel selective-resetting method
to prevent state colinearity; and (3) capturing long-range dependencies in deep
recurrent neural networks with non-diagonal recurrent states, computed in
parallel via a prefix scan, without requiring any form of stabilization. Our
results show that our implementation of GOOMs, combined with efficient parallel
scanning, offers a scalable and numerically robust alternative to conventional
floating-point numbers for high-dynamic-range applications.

Result: 在9个公共基准数据集中，RADF在5个数据集上的AUC性能超越了最先进的异常检测模型，其中7个数据集的AUC超过0.85，这是其他模型无法达到的成就。

Conclusion: RADF框架通过自动化算法选择和调参，有效解决了大规模分布式系统中的异常检测挑战，在多个基准数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in large, distributed systems presents several
challenges. The first challenge arises from the sheer volume of data that needs
to be processed. Flagging anomalies in a high-throughput environment calls for
a careful consideration of both algorithm and system design. The second
challenge comes from the heterogeneity of time-series datasets that leverage
such a system in production. In practice, anomaly detection systems are rarely
deployed for a single use case. Typically, there are several metrics to
monitor, often across several domains (e.g. engineering, business and
operations). A one-size-fits-all approach rarely works, so these systems need
to be fine-tuned for every application - this is often done manually. The third
challenge comes from the fact that determining the root-cause of anomalies in
such settings is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Identifying (in real
time) a time-series dataset that is associated causally with the anomalous
time-series data is a very difficult problem. In this paper, we describe a
unified framework that addresses these challenges. Reasoning based Anomaly
Detection Framework (RADF) is designed to perform real time anomaly detection
on very large datasets. This framework employs a novel technique (mSelect) that
automates the process of algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning for
each use case. Finally, it incorporates a post-detection capability that allows
for faster triaging and root-cause determination. Our extensive experiments
demonstrate that RADF, powered by mSelect, surpasses state-of-the-art anomaly
detection models in AUC performance for 5 out of 9 public benchmarking
datasets. RADF achieved an AUC of over 0.85 for 7 out of 9 datasets, a
distinction unmatched by any other state-of-the-art model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型在处理稀疏采样和高维轨迹时，通常只能学习成对转移，无法有效捕捉多时间点的联合动态特性。

Method: 采用分段二次插值路径作为流匹配的平滑目标，联合优化漂移项和数据驱动的扩散系数，并基于理论条件确保学习稳定性。

Result: 在合成基准测试和真实世界纵向神经影像数据集上，IMMFM在预测准确性和下游任务性能方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IMMFM能够有效捕捉内在随机性，处理不规则稀疏采样，并生成受试者特定的轨迹，为序列数据建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generative models for sequential data often struggle with sparsely sampled
and high-dimensional trajectories, typically reducing the learning of dynamics
to pairwise transitions. We propose \textit{Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow
Matching} (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics
jointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a
piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and
jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a
theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic
stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific
trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal
neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both
forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了Latent Mixture of Symmetries (Latent MoS)模型，通过捕捉复杂动态测量中的对称性混合来改进动态学习，在插值和外推任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设单一全局对称群，并将对称性发现与动态学习分开处理，导致表达能力有限和误差累积。需要更有效的样本来学习工程系统的动态。

Method: 提出Latent MoS模型，捕捉对称性主导的潜在因子混合，局部且可证明地保持基础对称变换。引入分层架构堆叠MoS块来捕获长期等变性。

Result: 在多种物理系统的数值实验中，Latent MoS在插值和外推任务中优于最先进的基线方法，并提供可解释的潜在表示。

Conclusion: Latent MoS通过混合对称性方法显著提高了动态学习的样本效率和表达能力，为未来的几何和安全关键分析提供了基础。

Abstract: Learning dynamics is essential for model-based control and Reinforcement
Learning in engineering systems, such as robotics and power systems. However,
limited system measurements, such as those from low-resolution sensors, demand
sample-efficient learning. Symmetry provides a powerful inductive bias by
characterizing equivariant relations in system states to improve sample
efficiency. While recent methods attempt to discover symmetries from data, they
typically assume a single global symmetry group and treat symmetry discovery
and dynamic learning as separate tasks, leading to limited expressiveness and
error accumulation. In this paper, we propose the Latent Mixture of Symmetries
(Latent MoS), an expressive model that captures a mixture of symmetry-governed
latent factors from complex dynamical measurements. Latent MoS focuses on
dynamic learning while locally and provably preserving the underlying symmetric
transformations. To further capture long-term equivariance, we introduce a
hierarchical architecture that stacks MoS blocks. Numerical experiments in
diverse physical systems demonstrate that Latent MoS outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in interpolation and extrapolation tasks while
offering interpretable latent representations suitable for future geometric and
safety-critical analyses.

Abstract: Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction for turbofan engines plays a vital
role in predictive maintenance, ensuring operational safety and efficiency in
aviation. Although data-driven approaches using machine learning and deep
learning have shown potential, they face challenges such as limited data and
distribution shifts caused by varying operating conditions. Domain Adaptation
(DA) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling knowledge transfer from
source domains with abundant data to target domains with scarce data while
mitigating distributional shifts. Given the unique properties of turbofan
engines, such as complex operating conditions, high-dimensional sensor data,
and slower-changing signals, it is essential to conduct a focused review of DA
techniques specifically tailored to turbofan engines. To address this need,
this paper provides a comprehensive review of DA solutions for turbofan engine
RUL prediction, analyzing key methodologies, challenges, and recent
advancements. A novel taxonomy tailored to turbofan engines is introduced,
organizing approaches into methodology-based (how DA is applied),
alignment-based (where distributional shifts occur due to operational
variations), and problem-based (why certain adaptations are needed to address
specific challenges). This taxonomy offers a multidimensional view that goes
beyond traditional classifications by accounting for the distinctive
characteristics of turbofan engine data and the standard process of applying DA
techniques to this area. Additionally, we evaluate selected DA techniques on
turbofan engine datasets, providing practical insights for practitioners and
identifying key challenges. Future research directions are identified to guide
the development of more effective DA techniques, advancing the state of RUL
prediction for turbofan engines.

Motivation: 解决部分可观测系统中信念跟踪的问题，传统方法在跟踪快速变化、多模态信念时存在粒子贫化风险，需要结合深度学习的表达能力。

Method: NBF训练寻找任务诱导信念的良好潜在表示，将信念映射到固定长度的嵌入向量，使用粒子式更新在嵌入空间中计算后验分布。

Result: 在三个部分可观测环境的状态估计任务中验证了NBF的有效性，能够跟踪快速变化的多模态信念并减轻粒子贫化风险。

Conclusion: NBF成功结合了经典滤波器的计算效率和深度生成模型的表达能力，为部分可观测系统的信念跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Neural Bayesian Filtering (NBF), an algorithm for maintaining
distributions over hidden states, called beliefs, in partially observable
systems. NBF is trained to find a good latent representation of the beliefs
induced by a task. It maps beliefs to fixed-length embedding vectors, which
condition generative models for sampling. During filtering, particle-style
updates compute posteriors in this embedding space using incoming observations
and the environment's dynamics. NBF combines the computational efficiency of
classical filters with the expressiveness of deep generative models - tracking
rapidly shifting, multimodal beliefs while mitigating the risk of particle
impoverishment. We validate NBF in state estimation tasks in three partially
observable environments.

TL;DR: 使用LLaMA预处理推文数据，结合三种情绪分析方法与历史股价数据，通过LSTM模型预测股票价格显著变动，相比仅使用历史股价的基准模型准确率从13.5%提升至最高38.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 股票市场波动性强且对投资者情绪敏感，准确预测短期股价变动具有挑战性。本文旨在通过整合社交媒体情绪特征与历史股价信息来提高预测准确性。

Method: 使用Meta的Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct预处理推文数据，采用三种情绪分析方法（基于Transformer的DistilRoBERTa分类器和两种基于词典的NRC方法），将情绪特征与前一天股价数据结合训练LSTM模型。

Result: 在TSLA、AAPL和AMZN股票上的实验结果显示，所有三种情绪分析方法都提高了预测显著价格变动的平均准确率。基于DistilRoBERTa的模型表现最佳，使用LLaMA增强情绪分析后准确率从23.6%提升至38.5%。

Conclusion: 使用大语言模型预处理推文内容能增强情绪分析的有效性，进而提高预测股票显著价格变动的准确性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting short-term stock price movement remains a challenging
task due to the market's inherent volatility and sensitivity to investor
sentiment. This paper discusses a deep learning framework that integrates
emotion features extracted from tweet data with historical stock price
information to forecast significant price changes on the following day. We
utilize Meta's Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct model to preprocess tweet data, thereby
enhancing the quality of emotion features derived from three emotion analysis
approaches: a transformer-based DistilRoBERTa classifier from the Hugging Face
library and two lexicon-based methods using National Research Council Canada
(NRC) resources. These features are combined with previous-day stock price data
to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. Experimental results on TSLA,
AAPL, and AMZN stocks show that all three emotion analysis methods improve the
average accuracy for predicting significant price movements, compared to the
baseline model using only historical stock prices, which yields an accuracy of
13.5%. The DistilRoBERTa-based stock prediction model achieves the best
performance, with accuracy rising from 23.6% to 38.5% when using LLaMA-enhanced
emotion analysis. These results demonstrate that using large language models to
preprocess tweet content enhances the effectiveness of emotion analysis which
in turn improves the accuracy of predicting significant stock price movements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法在下一代架构中效果下降，研究发现这些方法只是偏置采样轨迹而非真正移除概念，需要区分表面安全与真实概念移除。

Method: 提出RevAm框架，基于RL的轨迹优化，使用Group Relative Policy Optimization动态引导去噪过程，无需修改模型权重即可复活被擦除概念。

Result: RevAm实现了优越的概念复活保真度，同时将计算时间减少10倍，揭示了当前安全机制的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 当前基于轨迹操纵的擦除技术存在根本可逆性，需要开发更鲁棒的擦除方法。

Abstract: Concept erasure techniques have been widely deployed in T2I diffusion models
to prevent inappropriate content generation for safety and copyright
considerations. However, as models evolve to next-generation architectures like
Flux, established erasure methods (\textit{e.g.}, ESD, UCE, AC) exhibit
degraded effectiveness, raising questions about their true mechanisms. Through
systematic analysis, we reveal that concept erasure creates only an illusion of
``amnesia": rather than genuine forgetting, these methods bias sampling
trajectories away from target concepts, making the erasure fundamentally
reversible. This insight motivates the need to distinguish superficial safety
from genuine concept removal. In this work, we propose \textbf{RevAm}
(\underline{Rev}oking \underline{Am}nesia), an RL-based trajectory optimization
framework that resurrects erased concepts by dynamically steering the denoising
process without modifying model weights. By adapting Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to diffusion models, RevAm explores diverse recovery
trajectories through trajectory-level rewards, overcoming local optima that
limit existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevAm achieves
superior concept resurrection fidelity while reducing computational time by
10$\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms and
underscoring the need for more robust erasure techniques beyond trajectory
manipulation.

TL;DR: 隐式模型通过单参数块迭代到固定点计算输出，实现无限深度、权重绑定的网络，训练时内存需求显著降低。研究表明，通过增加测试时计算，这些紧凑模型可以匹配甚至超越更大的显式网络，其表达能力随测试时计算量扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式模型虽然经验上知道通过增加测试时计算可以匹配或超越更大显式网络的性能，但其底层机制尚不清楚。本文旨在通过非参数分析来理解这种表达能力差距。

Method: 采用非参数分析方法，对表达能力进行严格数学刻画，证明简单的隐式算子通过迭代可以逐步表达更复杂的映射。证明对于广泛类别的隐式模型，其表达能力随测试时计算量扩展，最终匹配更丰富的函数类。

Result: 在图像重建、科学计算和运筹学三个领域验证了理论：随着测试时迭代次数增加，学习映射的复杂性上升，同时解质量提高并稳定。

Conclusion: 隐式模型通过迭代过程实现表达能力随计算资源扩展，这解释了为什么紧凑模型通过更多测试时计算可以达到与更大显式网络相当的性能。

Abstract: Implicit models, an emerging model class, compute outputs by iterating a
single parameter block to a fixed point. This architecture realizes an
infinite-depth, weight-tied network that trains with constant memory,
significantly reducing memory needs for the same level of performance compared
to explicit models. While it is empirically known that these compact models can
often match or even exceed larger explicit networks by allocating more
test-time compute, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood.
  We study this gap through a nonparametric analysis of expressive power. We
provide a strict mathematical characterization, showing that a simple and
regular implicit operator can, through iteration, progressively express more
complex mappings. We prove that for a broad class of implicit models, this
process lets the model's expressive power scale with test-time compute,
ultimately matching a much richer function class. The theory is validated
across three domains: image reconstruction, scientific computing, and
operations research, demonstrating that as test-time iterations increase, the
complexity of the learned mapping rises, while the solution quality
simultaneously improves and stabilizes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现稀疏自编码器(SAE)的可解释性与模型行为控制效用之间仅存在弱正相关，表明可解释性不是控制性能的充分指标。作者提出了Delta Token Confidence特征选择标准，显著提升了模型控制性能，并使可解释性与效用之间的相关性消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证稀疏自编码器(SAE)的可解释性是否确实意味着更好的模型行为控制能力，因为目前普遍假设可解释特征自然能有效控制模型行为。

Method: 在三个大语言模型(Gemma-2-2B, Qwen-2.5-3B, Gemma-2-9B)上训练90个SAE，涵盖5种架构和6个稀疏度级别，使用SAEBench和AxBench分别评估可解释性和控制效用，并通过Kendall秩相关系数分析两者关系。提出Delta Token Confidence特征选择标准来衡量特征放大对下一个token分布的影响。

Result: 可解释性与控制效用之间仅存在弱正相关(tau b ≈ 0.298)。使用Delta Token Confidence选择特征后，三个LLM的控制性能比当前最佳输出分数标准提升了52.52%。选择高Delta Token Confidence特征后，可解释性与效用之间的相关性消失(tau b ≈ 0)，甚至变为负相关。

Conclusion: 可解释性不是模型控制效用的充分代理指标，两者存在明显分歧。Delta Token Confidence是更有效的特征选择标准，能显著提升模型控制性能，同时揭示可解释特征与控制有效特征之间的差异。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used to steer large language models
(LLMs), based on the assumption that their interpretable features naturally
enable effective model behavior steering. Yet, a fundamental question remains
unanswered: does higher interpretability indeed imply better steering utility?
To answer this question, we train 90 SAEs across three LLMs (Gemma-2-2B,
Qwen-2.5-3B, Gemma-2-9B), spanning five architectures and six sparsity levels,
and evaluate their interpretability and steering utility based on SAEBench
(arXiv:2501.12345) and AxBench (arXiv:2502.23456) respectively, and perform a
rank-agreement analysis via Kendall's rank coefficients (tau b). Our analysis
reveals only a relatively weak positive association (tau b approx 0.298),
indicating that interpretability is an insufficient proxy for steering
performance. We conjecture the interpretability utility gap may stem from the
selection of SAE features, as not all of them are equally effective for
steering. To further find features that truly steer the behavior of LLMs, we
propose a novel selection criterion called Delta Token Confidence, which
measures how much amplifying a feature changes the next token distribution. We
show that our method improves the steering performance of three LLMs by 52.52
percent compared to the current best output score based criterion
(arXiv:2503.34567). Strikingly, after selecting features with high Delta Token
Confidence, the correlation between interpretability and utility vanishes (tau
b approx 0), and can even become negative. This further highlights the
divergence between interpretability and utility for the most effective steering
features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据无知识蒸馏方法存在三个主要问题：缺乏伪监督学习范式、无法区分不同类别样本分布导致生成模糊样本、以及无法优化类别多样性样本，这些限制了学生模型的性能提升。

Method: 使用条件生成对抗网络合成类别特定的多样化图像，改进生成器模块以更好区分不同类别分布，并基于教师和学生视图提出伪监督对比学习来增强样本多样性。

Conclusion: CPSC-DFKD通过条件生成和伪监督对比学习有效解决了当前数据无知识蒸馏方法的局限性，在模型压缩和隐私保护方面表现出色。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation~(DFKD) is an effective manner to solve model
compression and transmission restrictions while retaining privacy protection,
which has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Currently, the
majority of existing methods utilize a generator to synthesize images to
support the distillation. Although the current methods have achieved great
success, there are still many issues to be explored. Firstly, the outstanding
performance of supervised learning in deep learning drives us to explore a
pseudo-supervised paradigm on DFKD. Secondly, current synthesized methods
cannot distinguish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus
producing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the
teacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category-wise diversity
samples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and
further achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above
limitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional
pseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation~(CPSC-DFKD).
The primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional
generative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images
for pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the modules of the generator to
distinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing
pseudo-supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to
enhance diversity. Comprehensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets
validate the performance lift of both the student and generator brought by
CPSC-DFKD. The code is available at https://github.com/RoryShao/CPSC-DFKD.git

TL;DR: 提出了一个数据最小化框架，通过优先级队列树搜索在隐私有序转换空间中寻找最优平衡点，量化在保持任务效用的前提下最少需要披露的隐私信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在消费应用中的快速部署导致个人信息频繁交换，用户为获得有用响应往往过度分享信息，增加了通过记忆、上下文个性化或安全漏洞带来的隐私风险。

Method: 开发了一个正式定义和操作化数据最小化的框架，使用优先级队列树搜索在隐私有序转换空间中定位最优平衡点，并在四个数据集上评估了九个LLM的可实现数据最小化程度。

Result: 前沿大型LLM能够容忍更强的数据最小化同时保持任务质量（GPT-5可删减85.7% vs Qwen2.5-0.5B仅19.3%），但LLM难以直接预测最优数据最小化，存在偏向抽象的偏见导致过度分享。

Conclusion: 不仅存在隐私差距，还存在能力差距：模型可能缺乏对解决任务实际所需信息的意识，无法准确判断需要披露的最小信息量。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language models (LLMs) in consumer applications
has led to frequent exchanges of personal information. To obtain useful
responses, users often share more than necessary, increasing privacy risks via
memorization, context-based personalization, or security breaches. We present a
framework to formally define and operationalize data minimization: for a given
user prompt and response model, quantifying the least privacy-revealing
disclosure that maintains utility, and we propose a priority-queue tree search
to locate this optimal point within a privacy-ordered transformation space. We
evaluated the framework on four datasets spanning open-ended conversations
(ShareGPT, WildChat) and knowledge-intensive tasks with single-ground-truth
answers (CaseHold, MedQA), quantifying achievable data minimization with nine
LLMs as the response model. Our results demonstrate that larger frontier LLMs
can tolerate stronger data minimization while maintaining task quality than
smaller open-source models (85.7% redaction for GPT-5 vs. 19.3% for
Qwen2.5-0.5B). By comparing with our search-derived benchmarks, we find that
LLMs struggle to predict optimal data minimization directly, showing a bias
toward abstraction that leads to oversharing. This suggests not just a privacy
gap, but a capability gap: models may lack awareness of what information they
actually need to solve a task.

TL;DR: REG优化器通过使用行列缩放(RACS)操作符替代Muon的矩阵符号函数，解决了Muon在LLM训练中的不稳定性和与AdamW预训练模型的不兼容问题，实现了更好的性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器虽然通过正则化梯度更新改进了AdamW，但其依赖矩阵符号函数会导致训练不稳定，且在微调AdamW预训练模型时表现不佳。

Method: 提出REG优化器，用行列缩放(RACS)操作符替代Muon的矩阵符号函数，该操作符基于矩阵平衡理论，以更温和的方式正则化更新步骤。

Result: 在LLM训练实验中，REG优化器不仅性能优于AdamW，而且保持了与AdamW训练范式的一致性，在微调阶段避免了Muon观察到的性能下降。

Conclusion: REG优化器通过更温和的正则化方法，在保持AdamW兼容性的同时实现了更好的训练稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Optimizers are crucial for the efficient training of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While AdamW is the de facto standard, recent structure-aware optimizers
like Muon have emerged, which regularize gradient updates by operating on
entire weight matrices. The Muon optimizer balances the gradient updates along
all the directions. However, Muon's reliance on the matrix sign function can
lead to training instability, exhibits incompatibility when fine-tuning models
pre-trained with AdamW. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REG},
a novel optimizer that replaces Muon's aggressive matrix sign operator with the
Row-and-Column-Scaling (RACS) operator. Theoretically grounded in balancing a
matrix, the RACS operator regularizes the update steps in a less drastic
manner, making it simpler to implement and more compatible with established
training dynamics. Through extensive empirical experiments on LLM training, we
demonstrate that our REG optimizer not only achieves superior performance and
stability over AdamW, but also maintains consistency with the AdamW training
paradigm. This consistency is particularly evident during the fine-tuning
stage, where REG optimizer avoids the performance degradation observed with
Muon.

Motivation: 小型视觉语言模型计算效率高但泛化能力弱，现有测试时扩展方法计算成本高，违背小型模型的设计目标。

Method: TTAug通过生成多个增强输入并在token级别聚合输出；TTAdapt使用TTAug生成的共识伪标签在推理时调整模型参数。

Result: 在九个基准测试中展示了一致的性能提升，同时保持适合资源受限环境的计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同规模模型和不同VLM之间具有通用性，无需额外调优即可实现性能提升。

Abstract: Small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide a computationally efficient
alternative to larger models, at the cost of weaker generalization abilities
and downstream task performance. These shortcomings could be addressed by
test-time scaling techniques, but existing methods are typically
computationally demanding, contradicting the resource-efficient design goals of
small models. To address these limitations, we propose two novel and efficient
test-time scaling strategies that leverage the model-internal features rather
than external supervision: (i) Test-Time Augmentation (TTAug), which generates
multiple augmented inputs and aggregates outputs at the token level without
parameter updates, and (ii) Test-Time Adaptation (TTAdapt), which adapts model
parameters during inference using consensus-based pseudolabels from TTAug.
Through extensive experiments across nine benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent
performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency suitable
for resource-constrained environments. The generality of our approach is
demonstrated both within models at different scales and across different VLMs
without additional tuning.

Method: 在两种设置下设计审计算法：黑盒模型（无数据分布假设）和混合模型（特征和真实标签遵循指数族分布的混合）。利用截断样本学习和MAP预言机，将球形高斯混合结果扩展到指数族混合。

Result: 在黑盒设置下提出接近最优的审计算法，证明自然基线方法严格次优；在混合模型设置下设计的算法审计成本显著低于黑盒情况。在真实数据集上比自然基线节省约50%的审计成本。

Conclusion: 所提出的公平性审计算法在部分反馈环境下具有显著的成本优势，适用于多种公平性指标，为现实世界中的公平性评估提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of auditing the fairness of a given classifier under
partial feedback, where true labels are available only for positively
classified individuals, (e.g., loan repayment outcomes are observed only for
approved applicants). We introduce a novel cost model for acquiring additional
labeled data, designed to more accurately reflect real-world costs such as
credit assessment, loan processing, and potential defaults. Our goal is to find
optimal fairness audit algorithms that are more cost-effective than random
exploration and natural baselines.
  In our work, we consider two audit settings: a black-box model with no
assumptions on the data distribution, and a mixture model, where features and
true labels follow a mixture of exponential family distributions. In the
black-box setting, we propose a near-optimal auditing algorithm under mild
assumptions and show that a natural baseline can be strictly suboptimal. In the
mixture model setting, we design a novel algorithm that achieves significantly
lower audit cost than the black-box case. Our approach leverages prior work on
learning from truncated samples and maximum-a-posteriori oracles, and extends
known results on spherical Gaussian mixtures to handle exponential family
mixtures, which may be of independent interest. Moreover, our algorithms apply
to popular fairness metrics including demographic parity, equal opportunity,
and equalized odds. Empirically, we demonstrate strong performance of our
algorithms on real-world fair classification datasets like Adult Income and Law
School, consistently outperforming natural baselines by around 50% in terms of
audit cost.

Abstract: CUDA kernel optimization has become a critical bottleneck for AI performance,
as deep learning training and inference efficiency directly depends on highly
optimized GPU kernels.
  Despite the promise of Large Language Models (LLMs) for automating kernel
optimization, this field suffers from a fragmented ecosystem of isolated and
incomparable approaches with unclear problem formulations.
  Furthermore, general-purpose LLM code evolution methods cannot meet strict
correctness requirements of CUDA kernel optimization.
  We address these fundamental challenges by first formalizing CUDA kernel
optimization as a code optimization task with a clear objective, constraints,
and evaluation metrics.
  We then establish the first systematic LLM-based code evolution framework,
EvoEngineer, that provides guidance for designing and adapting optimization
strategies to achieve a balance between performance and correctness.
  Finally, we implement a kernel optimization system based on this framework
and conduct extensive experiments on 91 real-world CUDA kernels.
  Our results demonstrate that EvoEngineer achieves a principled balance
between performance and correctness, with the highest averaged median speedup
of \textbf{2.72}$\times$ over baseline CUDA kernels and a code validity rate of
\textbf{69.8}\%, outperforming existing methods on both dimensions.
  Our method achieves a maximum speedup of \textbf{36.75}$\times$ among all
operations over PyTorch kernels and delivers the highest speedup on \textbf{28}
(\textbf{56.0\%}) of 50 operations that achieve over \textbf{2$\times$}
acceleration.

Abstract: Supervised learning (SL) methods are indispensable for neural network (NN)
training used to perform classification tasks. While resulting in very high
accuracy, SL training often requires making NN parameter number dependent on
the number of classes, limiting their applicability when the number of classes
is extremely large or unknown in advance. In this paper we propose a
methodology that allows one to train the same NN architecture regardless of the
number of classes. This is achieved by using predefined vector systems as the
target latent space configuration (LSC) during NN training. We discuss the
desired properties of target configurations and choose randomly perturbed
vectors of An root system for our experiments. These vectors are used to
successfully train encoders and visual transformers (ViT) on Cinic-10 and
ImageNet-1K in low- and high-dimensional cases by matching NN predictions with
the predefined vectors. Finally, ViT is trained on a dataset with 1.28 million
classes illustrating the applicability of the method to training on datasets
with extremely large number of classes. In addition, potential applications of
LSC in lifelong learning and NN distillation are discussed illustrating
versatility of the proposed methodology.

Motivation: DoRA虽然比LoRA有更好的学习能力和训练稳定性，但仍存在训练不稳定和样本效率不足的问题，需要进一步改进。

Method: 1) 在DoRA权重分解的分母中注入噪声作为自适应正则化器；2) 用辅助网络动态生成低秩矩阵，实现跨层参数耦合。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，DoRAN一致优于LoRA、DoRA和其他PEFT基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合噪声正则化和网络参数生成的方法为基础模型的稳健高效微调提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have become the standard
paradigm for adapting large-scale models. Among these techniques,
Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) has been shown to improve both the
learning capacity and training stability of the vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) method by explicitly decomposing pre-trained weights into magnitude and
directional components. In this work, we propose DoRAN, a new variant of DoRA
designed to further stabilize training and boost the sample efficiency of DoRA.
Our approach includes two key stages: (i) injecting noise into the denominator
of DoRA's weight decomposition, which serves as an adaptive regularizer to
mitigate instabilities; and (ii) replacing static low-rank matrices with
auxiliary networks that generate them dynamically, enabling parameter coupling
across layers and yielding better sample efficiency in both theory and
practice. Comprehensive experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
DoRAN consistently outperforms LoRA, DoRA, and other PEFT baselines. These
results underscore the effectiveness of combining stabilization through
noise-based regularization with network-based parameter generation, offering a
promising direction for robust and efficient fine-tuning of foundation models.

Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have found widespread applications in
machine learning for time series prediction and dynamical systems
reconstruction, and experienced a recent renaissance with improved training
algorithms and architectural designs. Understanding why and how trained RNNs
produce their behavior is important for scientific and medical applications,
and explainable AI more generally. An RNN's dynamical repertoire depends on the
topological and geometrical properties of its state space. Stable and unstable
manifolds of periodic points play a particularly important role: They dissect a
dynamical system's state space into different basins of attraction, and their
intersections lead to chaotic dynamics with fractal geometry. Here we introduce
a novel algorithm for detecting these manifolds, with a focus on
piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) employing rectified linear units (ReLUs) as
their activation function. We demonstrate how the algorithm can be used to
trace the boundaries between different basins of attraction, and hence to
characterize multistability, a computationally important property. We further
show its utility in finding so-called homoclinic points, the intersections
between stable and unstable manifolds, and thus establish the existence of
chaos in PLRNNs. Finally we show for an empirical example, electrophysiological
recordings from a cortical neuron, how insights into the underlying dynamics
could be gained through our method.

Abstract: The study of multimodality has garnered significant interest in fields where
the analysis of interactions among multiple information sources can enhance
predictive modeling, data fusion, and interpretability. Partial information
decomposition (PID) has emerged as a useful information-theoretic framework to
quantify the degree to which individual modalities independently, redundantly,
or synergistically convey information about a target variable. However,
existing PID methods depend on optimizing over a joint distribution constrained
by estimated pairwise probability distributions, which are costly and
inaccurate for continuous and high-dimensional modalities. Our first key
insight is that the problem can be solved efficiently when the pairwise
distributions are multivariate Gaussians, and we refer to this problem as
Gaussian PID (GPID). We propose a new gradient-based algorithm that
substantially improves the computational efficiency of GPID based on an
alternative formulation of the underlying optimization problem. To generalize
the applicability to non-Gaussian data, we learn information-preserving
encoders to transform random variables of arbitrary input distributions into
pairwise Gaussian random variables. Along the way, we resolved an open problem
regarding the optimality of joint Gaussian solutions for GPID. Empirical
validation in diverse synthetic examples demonstrates that our proposed method
provides more accurate and efficient PID estimates than existing baselines. We
further evaluate a series of large-scale multimodal benchmarks to show its
utility in real-world applications of quantifying PID in multimodal datasets
and selecting high-performing models.

Conclusion: PDNS框架能够促进跨模式的彻底探索，有效解决多模态分布采样中的模式崩溃问题

Abstract: The task of learning a diffusion-based neural sampler for drawing samples
from an unnormalized target distribution can be viewed as a stochastic optimal
control problem on path measures. However, the training of neural samplers can
be challenging when the target distribution is multimodal with significant
barriers separating the modes, potentially leading to mode collapse. We propose
a framework named \textbf{Proximal Diffusion Neural Sampler (PDNS)} that
addresses these challenges by tackling the stochastic optimal control problem
via proximal point method on the space of path measures. PDNS decomposes the
learning process into a series of simpler subproblems that create a path
gradually approaching the desired distribution. This staged procedure traces a
progressively refined path to the desired distribution and promotes thorough
exploration across modes. For a practical and efficient realization, we
instantiate each proximal step with a proximal weighted denoising cross-entropy
(WDCE) objective. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of PDNS
through extensive experiments on both continuous and discrete sampling tasks,
including challenging scenarios in molecular dynamics and statistical physics.

Abstract: Accurate and fast urban noise prediction is pivotal for public health and for
regulatory workflows in cities, where the Environmental Noise Directive
mandates regular strategic noise maps and action plans, often needed in
permission workflows, right-of-way allocation, and construction scheduling.
Physics-based solvers are too slow for such time-critical, iterative "what-if"
studies. We evaluate conditional Normalizing Flows (Full-Glow) for generating
for generating standards-compliant urban sound-pressure maps from 2D urban
layouts in real time per 256x256 map on a single RTX 4090), enabling
interactive exploration directly on commodity hardware. On datasets covering
Baseline, Diffraction, and Reflection regimes, our model accelerates map
generation by >2000 times over a reference solver while improving NLoS accuracy
by up to 24% versus prior deep models; in Baseline NLoS we reach 0.65 dB MAE
with high structural fidelity. The model reproduces diffraction and
interference patterns and supports instant recomputation under source or
geometry changes, making it a practical engine for urban planning, compliance
mapping, and operations (e.g., temporary road closures, night-work variance
assessments).

<details>

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在增加采样预算时优势消失，原因是反向KL散度的模式寻求行为限制了策略在基础模型支持区域内的探索

Method: 使用前向KL惩罚替代反向KL惩罚进行分布外探索，并对参考策略进行重加权实现自适应分布内探索

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B和7B模型上训练，无需监督微调，在AIME2024和AIME2025评估中持续提升问题解决性能，突破基础模型性能上限

Conclusion: RAPO算法通过改进探索策略，推动了RLVR在挑战性推理任务中的前沿发展

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently enhanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for
mathematical problem solving. However, a fundamental limitation remains: as the
sampling budget increases, the advantage of RLVR-trained models over their
pretrained bases often diminishes or even vanishes, revealing a strong
dependence on the base model's restricted search space. We attribute this
phenomenon to the widespread use of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence regularizer, whose mode-seeking behavior keeps the policy trapped
inside the base model's support region and hampers wider exploration. To
address this issue, we propose RAPO (Rewards-Aware Policy Optimization), an
algorithm to promote broader yet focused exploration. Our method (i) utilizes
the forward KL penalty to replace the reverse KL penalty for
out-of-distribution exploration, and (ii) reweights the reference policy to
facilitate adaptive in-distribution exploration. We train Qwen2.5-3B and 7B
models with RAPO on the 8K SimpleRL-Zero dataset, without supervised
fine-tuning, and evaluate them on AIME2024 and AIME2025. Results show that RAPO
consistently improves problem-solving performance. Notably, RAPO enables models
to surpass the base model's performance ceiling and solves previously
intractable problems, advancing the frontier of RLVR for challenging reasoning
tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在模型和数据集缩放下的最优超参数传递方面取得了进展，但尚未建立统一的解释原理。

Method: 使用Scion优化器，发现联合最优缩放由输出层的算子范数控制，测量了最优学习率/批次大小对随数据集大小的缩放规律，并调整每层组学习率。

Result: 最优学习率/批次大小对具有相同的算子范数值，输出层对学习率最敏感，隐藏层受益于较低学习率。Scion的缩放规则与Adam优化器一致。

Conclusion: 提供了基于范数指导的最优缩放实用见解，并发布了包含2000多次运行日志的分布式Scion实现，支持大规模LLM训练动态研究。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in optimal hyperparameter transfer under model and
dataset scaling, no unifying explanatory principle has been established. Using
the Scion optimizer, we discover that joint optimal scaling across model and
dataset sizes is governed by a single invariant: the operator norm of the
output layer. Across models with up to 1.3B parameters trained on up to 138B
tokens, the optimal learning rate/batch size pair $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$
consistently has the same operator norm value - a phenomenon we term norm
transfer. This constant norm condition is necessary but not sufficient: while
for each dataset size, multiple $(\eta, B)$ reach the optimal norm, only a
unique $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$ achieves the best loss. As a sufficient
condition, we provide the first measurement of $(\eta^{\ast}, B^{\ast})$
scaling with dataset size for Scion, and find that the scaling rules are
consistent with those of the Adam optimizer. Tuning per-layer-group learning
rates also improves model performance, with the output layer being the most
sensitive and hidden layers benefiting from lower learning rates. We provide
practical insights on norm-guided optimal scaling and release our Distributed
Scion (Disco) implementation with logs from over two thousand runs to support
research on LLM training dynamics at scale.

Conclusion: RegCache能有效缓解视觉编码器中的异常值问题，显著减小量化精度损失

Abstract: Transformer-based vision encoders -- such as CLIP -- are central to
multimodal intelligence, powering applications from autonomous web agents to
robotic control. Since these applications often demand real-time processing of
massive visual data, reducing the inference cost of vision encoders is
critical. Post-training quantization offers a practical path, but remains
challenging even at 8-bit precision due to massive-scale activations (i.e.,
outliers). In this work, we propose $\textit{RegCache}$, a training-free
algorithm to mitigate outliers in vision encoders, enabling quantization with
significantly smaller accuracy drops. The proposed RegCache introduces
outlier-prone yet semantically meaningless prefix tokens to the target vision
encoder, which prevents other tokens from having outliers. Notably, we observe
that outliers in vision encoders behave differently from those in language
models, motivating two technical innovations: middle-layer prefixing and token
deletion. Experiments show that our method consistently improves the accuracy
of quantized models across both text-supervised and self-supervised vision
encoders.

Abstract: Deep generative models have made significant advances in generating complex
content, yet conditional generation remains a fundamental challenge. Existing
conditional generative adversarial networks often struggle to balance the dual
objectives of assessing authenticity and conditional alignment of input samples
within their conditional discriminators. To address this, we propose a novel
discriminator design that integrates three key capabilities: unconditional
discrimination, matching-aware supervision to enhance alignment sensitivity,
and adaptive weighting to dynamically balance all objectives. Specifically, we
introduce Sum of Naturalness and Alignment (SONA), which employs separate
projections for naturalness (authenticity) and alignment in the final layer
with an inductive bias, supported by dedicated objective functions and an
adaptive weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on class-conditional
generation tasks show that \ours achieves superior sample quality and
conditional alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image generation, confirming the
versatility and robustness of our approach.

Abstract: Continuous-depth graph neural networks, also known as Graph Neural
Differential Equations (GNDEs), combine the structural inductive bias of Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) with the continuous-depth architecture of Neural ODEs,
offering a scalable and principled framework for modeling dynamics on graphs.
In this paper, we present a rigorous convergence analysis of GNDEs with
time-varying parameters in the infinite-node limit, providing theoretical
insights into their size transferability. To this end, we introduce Graphon
Neural Differential Equations (Graphon-NDEs) as the infinite-node limit of
GNDEs and establish their well-posedness. Leveraging tools from graphon theory
and dynamical systems, we prove the trajectory-wise convergence of GNDE
solutions to Graphon-NDE solutions. Moreover, we derive explicit convergence
rates under two deterministic graph sampling regimes: (1) weighted graphs
sampled from smooth graphons, and (2) unweighted graphs sampled from
$\{0,1\}$-valued (discontinuous) graphons. We further establish size
transferability bounds, providing theoretical justification for the practical
strategy of transferring GNDE models trained on moderate-sized graphs to
larger, structurally similar graphs without retraining. Numerical experiments
using synthetic and real data support our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Multi-LLM collaboration promises accurate, robust, and context-aware
solutions, yet existing approaches rely on implicit selection and output
assessment without analyzing whether collaborating models truly complement or
conflict. We introduce LLM Chemistry -- a framework that measures when LLM
combinations exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviors that shape
collective performance beyond individual capabilities. We formalize the notion
of chemistry among LLMs, propose algorithms that quantify it by analyzing
interaction dependencies, and recommend optimal model ensembles accordingly.
Our theoretical analysis shows that chemistry among collaborating LLMs is most
evident under heterogeneous model profiles, with its outcome impact shaped by
task type, group size, and complexity. Evaluation on classification,
summarization, and program repair tasks provides initial evidence for these
task-dependent effects, thereby reinforcing our theoretical results. This
establishes LLM Chemistry as both a diagnostic factor in multi-LLM systems and
a foundation for ensemble recommendation.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of fields,
such as healthcare and internet traffic monitoring. The emergence of large
language models (LLMs) offers new opportunities for detecting anomalies in the
ubiquitous time series data. Traditional approaches struggle with
variable-length time series sequences and context-based anomalies. We propose
Soft Prompt Enhanced Anomaly Recognition (SPEAR), a novel approach to leverage
LLMs for anomaly detection with soft prompts and quantization. Our methodology
involves quantizing and transforming the time series data into input embeddings
and combining them with learnable soft prompt embeddings. These combined
embeddings are then fed into a frozen LLM. The soft prompts are updated
iteratively based on a cross-entropy loss, allowing the model to adapt to time
series anomaly detection. The use of soft prompts helps adapt LLMs effectively
to time series tasks, while quantization ensures optimal handling of sequences,
as LLMs are designed to handle discrete sequences. Our experimental results
demonstrate that soft prompts effectively increase LLMs' performance in
downstream tasks regarding time series anomaly detection.

Motivation: 研究强化学习在大型语言模型推理任务中面临的零奖励障碍问题，即当基础模型从未采样到正确解决方案时，训练会因零梯度而停滞。

Method: 使用图搜索任务评估现有方法（包括密集奖励、多样性激励和改进的信用分配），并测试数据干预方法——在训练集中添加更简单的样本。

Result: 实验表明现有方法都无法克服零奖励障碍，但简单的数据干预方法能够使模型最终解决原始困难任务，且无需修改强化学习算法本身。

Conclusion: 数据中心的干预（添加简单样本）是克服零奖励障碍的有效方法，为相关研究提供了新的解决思路和开源实现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome-based rewards has proven effective
for improving large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
its success often depends on the base model occasionally sampling correct
solutions. When no correct solutions are sampled, training encounters a
zero-reward barrier where learning stalls due to zero gradients. We study this
scenario through the graph search task introduced in Bachmann et al. (2024) and
evaluate recent methods that incorporate desirable components such as dense
rewards, diversity incentives, and improved credit assignment. Our experiments
show that none of these approaches overcome the zero-reward barrier if the base
model never produces a correct answer. In contrast, we find that a simple
data-centric intervention of adding easier samples to the training set enables
the model to eventually solve the original hard task despite starting from zero
reward. Importantly, this succeeds without modifying the RL algorithm itself.
Because official implementations of several baselines were unavailable, we
developed our own, which allowed us to conduct a detailed analysis of their
failure modes. We release these implementations to support further research at:

TL;DR: 本文扩展了结构化状态空间对偶性(SSD)，从标量恒等状态矩阵推广到一般对角SSM，建立了对角SSM与1-半可分因果掩码注意力之间的等价关系，揭示了SSM与Transformer之间的深层联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展SSD对偶性，从简单的标量恒等状态矩阵推广到更一般的对角状态矩阵，以支持更丰富的动态特性，同时保持训练复杂度的下界。

Method: 将SSD从标量恒等状态矩阵推广到一般对角SSM，建立对角SSM与1-半可分因果掩码注意力之间的等价关系，分析其对偶性的充要条件。

Result: 证明对角SSM在保持标量情况训练复杂度下界的同时支持更丰富的动态；建立了SSM与1-半可分掩码注意力等价的充要条件；发现标准softmax注意力由于秩爆炸无法扩展此对偶性。

Conclusion: 这些结果强化了循环SSM与Transformer之间的桥梁，为设计表达力强且高效的序列模型拓宽了设计空间。

Abstract: Structured State-Space Duality (SSD) [Dao & Gu, ICML 2024] is an equivalence
between a simple Structured State-Space Model (SSM) and a masked attention
mechanism. In particular, a state-space model with a scalar-times-identity
state matrix is equivalent to a masked self-attention with a $1$-semiseparable
causal mask. Consequently, the same sequence transformation (model) has two
algorithmic realizations: as a linear-time $O(T)$ recurrence or as a
quadratic-time $O(T^2)$ attention. In this note, we formalize and generalize
this duality: (i) we extend SSD from the scalar-identity case to general
diagonal SSMs (diagonal state matrices); (ii) we show that these diagonal SSMs
match the scalar case's training complexity lower bounds while supporting
richer dynamics; (iii) we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under
which an SSM is equivalent to $1$-semiseparable masked attention; and (iv) we
show that such duality fails to extend to standard softmax attention due to
rank explosion. Together, these results tighten bridge between recurrent SSMs
and Transformers, and widen the design space for expressive yet efficient
sequence models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在多教师设置下的推理蒸馏响应选择问题，提出了局部自然度方法，相比全局自然度能更有效地选择适合学生的响应，提升推理蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理蒸馏主要关注从单一教师选择响应，但在多教师设置下如何为不同学生选择最佳响应的问题尚未充分探索。当来自多个教师的响应可用时，全局自然度方法失效，需要新的选择策略。

Method: 提出了局部自然度方法，通过测量学生在短序列推理步骤上的对数概率（仅基于小局部窗口），来解决多教师响应选择问题。该方法支持教师选择和响应选择两个应用。

Result: 局部自然度在数学基准测试上使32B学生的准确率比全局选择提高了9.4个百分点，甚至超过了仅使用单一最佳教师数据训练的性能。

Conclusion: 局部数据质量评估和数据混合对于更有效的推理蒸馏具有强大作用，局部自然度方法在多教师设置下显著优于传统全局方法。

Abstract: Distilling long reasoning traces (10K+ tokens) from stronger teacher models
into smaller student LLMs via SFT has emerged as a standard paradigm. This
approach is practical and efficient: it leverages the ease of generating
abundant reasoning data from stronger models and provides a direct, data-driven
way to teach less capable models better reasoning. While previous work has
largely focused on prompt selection with responses from a single teacher, the
equally important problem of choosing the best response when multiple teacher
outputs are available for a single prompt remains underexplored. This challenge
becomes important in a multi-teacher setting, where different students may
benefit from the outputs of different teachers. This paper fills that gap with
a systematic study of response selection for reasoning distillation. We first
show that the current method, which picks responses the student assigns the
highest global log-probability (global naturalness), fails when responses come
from multiple teachers, i.e., global naturalness no longer correlates with
downstream performance, especially as the reasoning traces from strong teachers
become longer. To overcome this problem, we introduce Local Naturalness, which
measures the student's log-probabilities over short, sequential reasoning steps
conditioned only on a small local window. Local Naturalness enables two
applications: 1) Teacher Selection: Aggregating local scores across prompts
reliably identifies the most helpful teacher. 2) Response Selection from a
Multiple Teachers: When mixing answers from many teachers, Local Naturalness
boosts a 32B student's accuracy on math benchmarks by 9.4pp over global
selection, also surpassing the performance achieved by training on data from
the single best teacher. These results highlight the power of localized data
quality evaluation and data mixing for more effective reasoning distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在序列建模领域取得了革命性突破，但缺乏全面的数学理论来解释其结构和操作。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 采用算子理论和变分视角，将整个Transformer操作嵌入到令牌索引和特征维度的连续域中，构建统一的数学框架。

Result: 建立了一个原则性和灵活的理论框架，不仅加深了对Transformer核心组件的理论理解，还为架构设计、分析和基于控制的解释提供了新方向。

Conclusion: 这一新解释在深度学习架构和连续数学建模之间架起了桥梁，为开发可解释和理论基础的神经网络模型贡献了基础性视角。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has revolutionized the field of sequence
modeling and underpins the recent breakthroughs in large language models
(LLMs). However, a comprehensive mathematical theory that explains its
structure and operations remains elusive. In this work, we propose a novel
continuous framework that rigorously interprets the Transformer as a
discretization of a structured integro-differential equation. Within this
formulation, the self-attention mechanism emerges naturally as a non-local
integral operator, and layer normalization is characterized as a projection to
a time-dependent constraint. This operator-theoretic and variational
perspective offers a unified and interpretable foundation for understanding the
architecture's core components, including attention, feedforward layers, and
normalization. Our approach extends beyond previous theoretical analyses by
embedding the entire Transformer operation in continuous domains for both token
indices and feature dimensions. This leads to a principled and flexible
framework that not only deepens theoretical insight but also offers new
directions for architecture design, analysis, and control-based
interpretations. This new interpretation provides a step toward bridging the
gap between deep learning architectures and continuous mathematical modeling,
and contributes a foundational perspective to the ongoing development of
interpretable and theoretically grounded neural network models.

TL;DR: RACE Attention是一种线性复杂度的注意力机制替代方案，通过锐化角度相似性和随机投影近似注意力输出，解决了Softmax Attention在长上下文中的二次复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Softmax Attention的二次时间复杂度在处理长上下文时变得不可行，即使使用优化的GPU内核（如FlashAttention）也无法处理超过400万token的上下文。

Method: 使用锐化角度（余弦）相似性替代指数核，通过随机投影和软局部敏感哈希（LSH）近似注意力输出。

Result: 在语言建模、掩码语言建模和文本分类任务中，RACE Attention在保持准确性的同时显著减少了运行时间和内存使用，在NVIDIA GH200 GPU上可处理1200万token，在Intel Xeon Gold 5220R CPU上可处理7500万token。

Conclusion: RACE Attention为当前硬件提供了处理极长上下文窗口的实用且理论可靠的方法，有望在实践中得到广泛应用。

Abstract: Softmax Attention has a quadratic time complexity, which becomes prohibitive
to run at long contexts, even with highly optimized GPU kernels. For example,
FlashAttention (an exact, GPU-optimized implementation of Softmax Attention)
cannot complete a single forward-backward pass of a multi-head attention layer
once the context exceeds ~4 million tokens on an NVIDIA GH200 (96 GB). We
introduce RACE Attention, a kernel-inspired alternative to Softmax Attention
that is linear in sequence length and embedding dimension. RACE Attention
replaces the exponential kernel with a sharpened angular (cosine) similarity,
and approximates attention outputs via randomized projections and soft
Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH). Across language modeling, masked language
modeling, and text classification, RACE Attention matches the accuracy of
strong baselines while reducing runtime and memory. In a controlled scale test,
it processes up to 12 million tokens during a single forward-backward pass on
an NVIDIA GH200 GPU and 75 million tokens on an Intel Xeon Gold 5220R CPU, well
beyond the practical limits of the current state-of-the-art attention
implementations. RACE Attention thus offers a practical, theoretically grounded
mechanism for outrageously long context windows on today's hardware. We hope
that it gets adopted in practice.

Motivation: 扩散大语言模型尚未受益于现代后训练技术，特别是强化学习。现有方法缺乏理论基础，且传统LLM的RL算法与扩散框架不兼容。

Method: 提出了AGRPO算法，使用蒙特卡洛采样计算无偏策略梯度估计，是首个适用于dLLMs的可处理且忠实适配的策略梯度方法。

Result: 在GSM8K上获得+7.6%绝对增益，在Countdown任务上性能提升3.8倍，优于基线模型和可比RL方法，且在不同采样步数下保持性能优势。

Conclusion: 在线RL算法可以以理论上有依据的方式扩展到扩散LLMs，保持理论严谨性和实际有效性，实现了计算与性能的更好权衡。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are a new paradigm of
non-autoregressive language models that are trained to predict multiple tokens
in parallel and generate text via iterative unmasking. Recent works have
successfully pretrained dLLMs to parity with autoregressive LLMs at the 8B
scale, but dLLMs have yet to benefit from modern post-training techniques, e.g.
reinforcement learning (RL), that have proven effective for autoregressive
models. Crucially, algorithms designed for traditional LLMs aren't directly
compatible with diffusion frameworks due to inherent differences in modeling
assumptions. Moreover, existing attempts at dLLM post-training with RL rely on
heuristic-based objectives with no theoretical grounding. In this work, we
present Amortized Group Relative Policy Optimization (AGRPO), a principled
on-policy RL algorithm designed specifically for dLLMs. AGRPO uses Monte Carlo
sampling to compute an unbiased policy gradient estimate, making it the first
tractable, faithful adaptation of policy gradient methods for dLLMs. We
demonstrate AGRPO's effectiveness on different math/reasoning tasks, a common
setting for RL with LLMs, achieving up to +7.6% absolute gain on GSM8K and 3.8x
performance on the Countdown task over the baseline LLaDA-8B-Instruct model and
1.3x performance gains over comparable RL methods such as diffu-GRPO.
Furthermore, these gains persist across different numbers of sampling steps at
inference time, achieving better tradeoffs between compute and performance. Our
results demonstrate that online RL algorithms can be extended to diffusion LLMs
in principled ways, maintaining both theoretical soundness and practical
effectiveness.

Abstract: To address the dual challenges of inherent stochasticity and
non-differentiable metrics in physical spatiotemporal forecasting, we propose
Spatiotemporal Forecasting as Planning (SFP), a new paradigm grounded in
Model-Based Reinforcement Learning. SFP constructs a novel Generative World
Model to simulate diverse, high-fidelity future states, enabling an
"imagination-based" environmental simulation. Within this framework, a base
forecasting model acts as an agent, guided by a beam search-based planning
algorithm that leverages non-differentiable domain metrics as reward signals to
explore high-return future sequences. These identified high-reward candidates
then serve as pseudo-labels to continuously optimize the agent's policy through
iterative self-training, significantly reducing prediction error and
demonstrating exceptional performance on critical domain metrics like capturing
extreme events.

TL;DR: 该研究通过理论和实证分析发现，强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）对大型语言模型推理能力的影响存在两个阶段：利用阶段可能导致能力边界收缩，而探索阶段则促进能力边界扩展。


<details>

Motivation: 为了解决关于RLVR是扩展还是收缩LLMs推理能力的争议，研究者试图调和相互矛盾的研究发现。

Method: 通过理论和实证分析，识别了RLVR训练中的两阶段概率质量动态：利用阶段和探索阶段。

Result: 研究表明，在利用阶段过度利用可能导致能力边界收缩，而延长训练进入探索阶段则可以促进推理能力边界的扩展。

Conclusion: 该研究为仅使用相对负梯度来延长训练提供了理论和实证基础，有助于开发更先进的推理能力。

Abstract: The ongoing debate on whether reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) expands or shrinks the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) remains unresolved. Some studies contend that RLVR mainly improves
sampling efficiency but at the expense of diversity and exploratory capacity,
resulting in capability boundary shrinkage. In contrast, others demonstrate
that prolonged training can lead to the emergence of novel reasoning
strategies, suggesting capability boundary expansion. To reconcile these
contradictory findings, we theoretically and empirically show that both
perspectives are partially valid-each aligning with a separate phase in an
inherent two-stage probability mass dynamic: (1) Exploitation stage: initially,
the model primarily samples explored high-reward and low-reward tokens, while
rarely selecting the potentially optimal token. Positive advantage estimates
increase the probability of high-reward tokens and decrease those of low-reward
tokens, yet the optimal token's probability remains largely unchanged during
this stage. (2) Exploration stage: as training advances, the growth rate of
previously acquired high-reward tokens slows as their probabilities approach
saturation. When a potentially optimal token-now receiving positive advantage
estimates-is occasionally sampled, its probability increases, while those of
the originally high-reward tokens decrease. This dynamic suggests that
over-exploitation during the exploitation stage may lead to capability boundary
shrinkage, whereas prolonged training into the exploration stage can promote an
expansion of the reasoning capability boundary. Building upon our insights, we
revisit the potential of only using relative negative gradients for prolonging
training, providing a theoretical and empirical foundation for the development
of more advanced reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 交叉熵缩放定律长期以来指导大语言模型开发，但最近证据表明该定律在超大规模下失效，损失下降速度比预期慢，这给大语言模型开发带来显著困扰。

Method: 提出将交叉熵分解为误差熵、自对齐和置信度三个部分，在多个数据集和32个模型上进行广泛实验，模型规模跨越五个数量级。

Result: 只有误差熵遵循稳健的幂律缩放，而其他两个项基本保持不变；误差熵在小模型中占交叉熵主导份额，但随着模型增大比例减小。

Conclusion: 误差熵缩放定律能更准确地描述模型行为，将在大型语言模型的训练、理解和未来开发中具有广泛应用。

Abstract: The cross-entropy scaling law has long served as a key tool for guiding the
development of large language models. It shows that cross-entropy loss
decreases in a predictable power-law rate as the model size increases. However,
recent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the
loss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for
developing large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root
cause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead,
only one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a
novel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy,
Self-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that
this decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization
objectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models
spanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy
follows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely
invariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of
cross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow
larger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at
small scales but fails at very large ones. Our findings establish the
error-entropy scaling law as a more accurate description of model behavior. We
believe it will have wide applications in the training, understanding, and
future development of large language models.

Motivation: 现有的策略优化方法如GRPO在早期训练中面临梯度噪声大、更新不稳定和探索效率低的问题，影响了大型语言模型推理能力的提升。

Method: SFPO将每个训练步骤分解为三个阶段：在相同批次上进行短快速轨迹内步、控制离策略漂移的重定位机制、以及最终的慢速校正。这种重定位-更新设计保持目标和滚动过程不变。

Result: SFPO在数学推理基准测试中比GRPO平均提升2.80分，减少4.93倍的滚动次数，并在匹配GRPO最佳准确率时减少4.19倍的运行时间。

Conclusion: SFPO框架能够显著提高强化学习训练的稳定性、减少滚动次数并加速收敛，为推理任务的RL训练提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to enhancing reasoning in
large language models (LLMs). Yet on-policy algorithms such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer in early training: noisy gradients from
low-quality rollouts lead to unstable updates and inefficient exploration. We
introduce Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO), a simple yet efficient
framework to address these limitations via decomposing each step into three
stages: a short fast trajectory of inner steps on the same batch, a reposition
mechanism to control off-policy drift, and a final slow correction. This
reposition-before-update design preserves the objective and rollout process
unchanged, making SFPO plug-compatible with existing policy-gradient pipelines.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFPO consistently improves stability,
reduces rollouts, and accelerates convergence of reasoning RL training.
Specifically, it outperforms GRPO by up to 2.80 points in average on math
reasoning benchmarks. It also achieves up to 4.93\texttimes{} fewer rollouts
and a 4.19\texttimes{} reduction in wall-clock time to match GRPO's best
accuracy.

Motivation: 现有方法通常只使用蛋白质的一级结构，限制了捕捉涉及高级结构相互作用的能力。蛋白质具有多级结构，这些结构都会影响药物-靶点相互作用。

Method: 采用分层注意力机制挖掘多级蛋白质结构与药物结构在局部和全局粒度上的相互作用，然后利用挖掘到的相互作用融合不同层次的结构表示进行最终预测。

Conclusion: 该框架能够捕捉生物学上可转移的先验知识，避免了过度依赖表示学习导致的过拟合风险。

Abstract: Cold-start drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction focuses on interaction
between novel drugs and proteins. Previous methods typically learn transferable
interaction patterns between structures of drug and proteins to tackle it.
However, insight from proteomics suggest that protein have multi-level
structures and they all influence the DTI. Existing works usually represent
protein with only primary structures, limiting their ability to capture
interactions involving higher-level structures. Inspired by this insight, we
propose ColdDTI, a framework attending on protein multi-level structure for
cold-start DTI prediction. We employ hierarchical attention mechanism to mine
interaction between multi-level protein structures (from primary to quaternary)
and drug structures at both local and global granularities. Then, we leverage
mined interactions to fuse structure representations of different levels for
final prediction. Our design captures biologically transferable priors,
avoiding the risk of overfitting caused by excessive reliance on representation
learning. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that ColdDTI
consistently outperforms previous methods in cold-start settings.

LG. We theoretically analyze PEs in Position-Only Linear Attentions (POLAs),
introducing Linear Representation Complexity (LRC) to characterize when PEs
enable LG. Our analysis shows that PEs do not expand computational capabilities
but structure learned computations across positions. Extending to practical
Transformers, we propose Sequential Representation Complexity (SRC) and
conjecture that LG is possible if and only if SRC remains invariant across
scales. We support this hypothesis with empirical evidence in various reasoning
tasks. To enhance LG, we introduce Scale Hint, allowing flexible instance
scaling, and a Learning-Based Position Embedding framework that automatically
learns positional relations. Our work provides theoretical insights and
practical strategies for improving LG in Transformers.

### [365] [PhaseFormer: From Patches to Phases for Efficient and Effective Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04134)
*Yiming Niu,Jinliang Deng,Yongxin Tong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了PhaseFormer模型，通过相位视角建模周期性，使用紧凑相位嵌入和轻量级路由机制，在仅约1k参数的情况下实现了最先进的时序预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于patch处理的深度学习方法虽然增强了周期性的利用，但存在参数量大、计算成本高的问题，效率成为瓶颈。

Method: 引入相位视角建模周期性，通过相位嵌入进行相位级预测，使用轻量级路由机制实现跨相位高效交互。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，仅使用约1k参数，特别在大规模和复杂数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着向真正高效有效的时序预测迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Periodicity is a fundamental characteristic of time series data and has long
played a central role in forecasting. Recent deep learning methods strengthen
the exploitation of periodicity by treating patches as basic tokens, thereby
improving predictive effectiveness. However, their efficiency remains a
bottleneck due to large parameter counts and heavy computational costs. This
paper provides, for the first time, a clear explanation of why patch-level
processing is inherently inefficient, supported by strong evidence from
real-world data. To address these limitations, we introduce a phase perspective
for modeling periodicity and present an efficient yet effective solution,
PhaseFormer. PhaseFormer features phase-wise prediction through compact phase
embeddings and efficient cross-phase interaction enabled by a lightweight
routing mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhaseFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with around 1k parameters, consistently across
benchmark datasets. Notably, it excels on large-scale and complex datasets,
where models with comparable efficiency often struggle. This work marks a
significant step toward truly efficient and effective time series forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文对自回归语言模型(ARMs)和扩散语言模型(DLMs)进行了全面的性能比较研究，分析了两种架构在算术强度、上下文扩展和批处理推理等方面的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然扩散语言模型(DLMs)作为并行生成文本的替代架构出现，但其相对于广泛部署的自回归语言模型(ARMs)的性能影响尚未完全理解，需要进行系统性的性能分析。

Method: 采用理论分析和性能剖析数据相结合的方法，比较ARMs和DLMs的性能特征，并探索了具有分块解码的DLMs方法。

Result: 研究发现DLMs由于能在序列长度上利用并行性而具有更高的算术强度，但在扩展到长上下文时效果不佳；ARMs在批处理推理中表现出更高的吞吐量；减少采样步数对加速DLM推理至关重要。

Conclusion: DLMs在算术强度方面具有优势，但在上下文扩展和批处理性能方面存在挑战；分块解码的DLMs可以平衡算术强度和上下文扩展；优化采样步骤是提升DLM性能的关键。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a
broad range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including document
processing and coding. Autoregressive Language Models (ARMs), which generate
tokens sequentially conditioned on all previous tokens, have been the
predominant paradigm for LLMs. However, while these networks have achieved high
accuracy across a range of downstream tasks, they exhibit low arithmetic
intensity due to the inherent sequential dependency with next-token prediction.
Recently, Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative architecture. DLMs generate output text in parallel, breaking the
limitations of sequential dependency. However, the performance implications of
DLMs relative to commonly deployed ARMs are not fully understood. In this work,
we present a comprehensive performance study analyzing the performance
characteristics of ARMs and DLMs, using both theoretical analysis and profiling
data to characterize the trade-offs between these approaches. We illustrate
that although DLMs exhibit higher arithmetic intensity compared to ARMs because
of their capability to utilize parallelism across sequence lengths, they fail
to scale effectively to longer contexts. We then explore DLMs with block-wise
decoding, outlining how this approach allows for increased arithmetic
intensity, while still scaling well to long contexts (similar to ARMs). We also
show interesting trade-offs for batched inference, where we find that ARMs
exhibit superior throughput, as they benefit more from parallelism across
sequences in the batch. Finally, we highlight opportunities for accelerating
DLM inference, and, in particular, highlight the importance of reducing the
number of sampling steps for allowing open-source DLMs to provide improved
latency relative to ARMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于长期平均成本和不等式约束设置的自然critic-actor算法，并提供了非渐近收敛保证，同时通过实验验证了其竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注折扣成本设置下的actor-critic算法，且多为渐近收敛分析。本文旨在填补长期平均成本和约束设置下自然critic-actor算法的空白，并提供非渐近收敛保证。

Method: 提出了一种自然critic-actor算法，使用函数逼近处理长期平均成本和不等式约束，分析了最优学习率并提出了改进样本复杂度的修改方案。

Result: 建立了算法的非渐近收敛保证，在三个不同的Safety-Gym环境中进行实验，结果显示该算法与其他知名算法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 本文成功开发了首个适用于长期平均成本和约束设置的自然critic-actor算法，提供了理论保证并通过实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent studies have increasingly focused on non-asymptotic convergence
analyses for actor-critic (AC) algorithms. One such effort introduced a
two-timescale critic-actor algorithm for the discounted cost setting using a
tabular representation, where the usual roles of the actor and critic are
reversed. However, only asymptotic convergence was established there.
Subsequently, both asymptotic and non-asymptotic analyses of the critic-actor
algorithm with linear function approximation were conducted. In our work, we
introduce the first natural critic-actor algorithm with function approximation
for the long-run average cost setting and under inequality constraints. We
provide the non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for this algorithm. Our
analysis establishes optimal learning rates and we also propose a modification
to enhance sample complexity. We further show the results of experiments on
three different Safety-Gym environments where our algorithm is found to be
competitive in comparison with other well known algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 虽然具有更好的可解释性和数学基础，但其参数效率问题限制了实际部署。

Method: 利用KAN固有的分段多项式结构，将压缩问题建模为最优多面体区域合并问题，开发了ε等价压缩理论，并设计了最优动态规划算法。

Result: PolyKAN在保证严格误差控制的同时实现了可证明的最小压缩，算法复杂度在所有网络参数上都是多项式时间。

Conclusion: 该框架为KAN压缩提供了首个具有数学保证的形式化基础，为可解释神经架构的高效部署开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have emerged as a promising alternative to
traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), offering enhanced interpretability
and a strong mathematical foundation. However, their parameter efficiency
remains a significant challenge for practical deployment. This paper introduces
PolyKAN, a novel theoretical framework for KAN compression that provides formal
guarantees on both model size reduction and approximation error. By leveraging
the inherent piecewise polynomial structure of KANs, we formulate the
compression problem as one of optimal polyhedral region merging. We establish a
rigorous polyhedral characterization of KANs, develop a complete theory of
$\epsilon$-equivalent compression, and design an optimal dynamic programming
algorithm that guarantees minimal compression under specified error bounds. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that PolyKAN achieves provably minimal
compression while maintaining strict error control, with polynomial-time
complexity in all network parameters. The framework provides the first formal
foundation for KAN compression with mathematical guarantees, opening new
directions for efficient deployment of interpretable neural architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了在低精度设置下使用Flash Attention训练transformer模型时出现灾难性损失爆炸的机制原因，并提出了一个简单的修正方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着低精度格式在transformer模型训练中的采用，计算效率得到提升，但训练不稳定性问题阻碍了这一进展。本文旨在解释一个长期未解决的失败案例：在低精度设置下使用Flash Attention训练会导致灾难性损失爆炸。

Method: 通过深入分析揭示失败机制，发现这是由于注意力机制中相似低秩表示的出现与低精度算术中固有偏置舍入误差的复合效应共同导致的。然后引入对Flash Attention的最小修改来减轻舍入误差的偏置。

Result: 分析表明这些因素会创建一个误差累积的恶性循环，最终破坏训练动态。提出的简单修改成功稳定了训练过程，验证了分析的正确性。

Conclusion: 本文不仅提供了对长期未解决的训练不稳定问题的机制解释，还提供了一个实用的解决方案，为低精度transformer训练提供了稳定性保障。

Abstract: The pursuit of computational efficiency has driven the adoption of
low-precision formats for training transformer models. However, this progress
is often hindered by notorious training instabilities. This paper provides the
first mechanistic explanation for a long-standing and unresolved failure case
where training with flash attention in low-precision settings leads to
catastrophic loss explosions. Our in-depth analysis reveals that the failure is
not a random artifact but caused by two intertwined phenomena: the emergence of
similar low-rank representations within the attention mechanism and the
compounding effect of biased rounding errors inherent in low-precision
arithmetic. We demonstrate how these factors create a vicious cycle of error
accumulation that corrupts weight updates, ultimately derailing the training
dynamics. To validate our findings, we introduce a minimal modification to the
flash attention that mitigates the bias in rounding errors. This simple change
stabilizes the training process, confirming our analysis and offering a
practical solution to this persistent problem.

TL;DR: MLLMEraser：一种无需训练的多模态大语言模型遗忘框架，通过激活引导实现动态知识擦除，在保持保留知识的同时有效擦除指定内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型部署面临记忆隐私数据、过时知识和有害内容的问题，现有遗忘方法计算成本高、不可逆且会扭曲保留知识。

Method: 构建多模态擦除方向，对比对抗性扰动后的知识回忆与知识擦除图像-文本对，设计输入感知的引导机制自适应决定何时如何应用擦除方向。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5和Qwen-2.5-VL上的实验表明，MLLMEraser优于现有MLLM遗忘基线，实现更强的遗忘性能、更低的计算成本和最小的效用退化。

Conclusion: MLLMEraser提供了一种高效、无需训练的多模态大语言模型遗忘解决方案，在保持模型实用性的同时有效擦除指定内容。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities across vision-language tasks, yet their large-scale deployment
raises pressing concerns about memorized private data, outdated knowledge, and
harmful content. Existing unlearning approaches for MLLMs typically adapt
training-based strategies such as gradient ascent or preference optimization,
but these methods are computationally expensive, irreversible, and often
distort retained knowledge. In this work, we propose MLLMEraser, an
input-aware, training-free framework for test-time unlearning. Our approach
leverages activation steering to enable dynamic knowledge erasure without
parameter updates. Specifically, we construct a multimodal erasure direction by
contrasting adversarially perturbed, knowledge-recall image-text pairs with
knowledge-erasure counterparts, capturing both textual and visual
discrepancies. To prevent unnecessary interference, we further design an
input-aware steering mechanism that adaptively determines when and how the
erasure direction should be applied, preserving utility on retained knowledge
while enforcing forgetting on designated content. Experiments on LLaVA-1.5 and
Qwen-2.5-VL demonstrate that MLLMEraser consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art MLLM unlearning baselines, achieving stronger forgetting
performance with lower computational cost and minimal utility degradation.

Motivation: 现有基于GNN的方法通常依赖于显式观察到的结构，无法捕捉未观察到的相互作用，而这些相互作用对复杂物理行为和动力学机制至关重要。

Method: 提出PAINET模型，包含：(1)基于能量函数最小化轨迹的物理启发注意力网络；(2)保持等变性同时实现高效推理的并行解码器。

Result: 在人体运动捕捉、分子动力学和大规模蛋白质模拟等真实世界基准测试中，PAINET始终优于最新模型，3D动力学预测误差降低4.7%至41.5%，计算成本相当。

Conclusion: PAINET通过捕捉未观察到的相互作用，在多体系统的3D动力学建模中取得了显著改进，证明了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Modeling 3D dynamics is a fundamental problem in multi-body systems across
scientific and engineering domains and has important practical implications in
trajectory prediction and simulation. While recent GNN-based approaches have
achieved strong performance by enforcing geometric symmetries, encoding
high-order features or incorporating neural-ODE mechanics, they typically
depend on explicitly observed structures and inherently fail to capture the
unobserved interactions that are crucial to complex physical behaviors and
dynamics mechanism. In this paper, we propose PAINET, a principled
SE(3)-equivariant neural architecture for learning all-pair interactions in
multi-body systems. The model comprises: (1) a novel physics-inspired attention
network derived from the minimization trajectory of an energy function, and (2)
a parallel decoder that preserves equivariance while enabling efficient
inference. Empirical results on diverse real-world benchmarks, including human
motion capture, molecular dynamics, and large-scale protein simulations, show
that PAINET consistently outperforms recently proposed models, yielding 4.7% to
41.5% error reductions in 3D dynamics prediction with comparable computation
costs in terms of time and memory.

Motivation: 在大规模应用中，用轻量级MLP替代GNN的需求增长，但在自监督图表示学习中，由于性能更依赖于模型的归纳偏置，GNN到MLP的蒸馏更具挑战性。

Method: 使用去噪扩散模型作为教师助手，帮助将教师GNN的知识更好地蒸馏到学生MLP中，提升MLP在自监督图表示学习中的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的DAD-SGM方法通过扩散模型辅助蒸馏，成功解决了自监督图表示学习中GNN到MLP蒸馏的挑战。

Abstract: For large-scale applications, there is growing interest in replacing Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) with lightweight Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) via
knowledge distillation. However, distilling GNNs for self-supervised graph
representation learning into MLPs is more challenging. This is because the
performance of self-supervised learning is more related to the model's
inductive bias than supervised learning. This motivates us to design a new
distillation method to bridge a huge capacity gap between GNNs and MLPs in
self-supervised graph representation learning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{D}iffusion-\textbf{A}ssisted \textbf{D}istillation for
\textbf{S}elf-supervised \textbf{G}raph representation learning with
\textbf{M}LPs (DAD-SGM). The proposed method employs a denoising diffusion
model as a teacher assistant to better distill the knowledge from the teacher
GNN into the student MLP. This approach enhances the generalizability and
robustness of MLPs in self-supervised graph representation learning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that DAD-SGM effectively distills the knowledge of
self-supervised GNNs compared to state-of-the-art GNN-to-MLP distillation
methods. Our implementation is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FCI算法在进行条件独立性测试时经常需要穷举所有子集，导致虚假的独立性声明、多余或缺失的边以及不可靠的方向确定，需要更高效可靠的方法。

Method: 开发了BOSS-FCI和GRaSP-FCI作为GFCI的变体，提出FCIT方法用BOSS引导的定向测试替代穷举测试，并设计了LV-Dumb启发式方法直接返回BOSS DAG的PAG。

Result: 模拟和真实数据分析表明，BOSS-FCI和GRaSP-FCI提供了可靠基线，FCIT提高了效率和可靠性，LV-Dumb在实践中表现出优越的准确性。

Conclusion: 这些方法突出了分数引导和定向策略在可扩展隐变量因果发现中的价值。

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is especially challenging
when latent variables or selection bias are present. The Fast Causal Inference
(FCI) algorithm addresses this setting but often performs exhaustive
conditional independence tests across many subsets, leading to spurious
independence claims, extra or missing edges, and unreliable orientations. We
present a family of score-guided mixed-strategy causal search algorithms that
build on this tradition. First, we introduce BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI,
straightforward variants of GFCI that substitute BOSS or GRaSP for FGES,
thereby retaining correctness while incurring different scalability tradeoffs.
Second, we develop FCI Targeted-testing (FCIT), a novel mixed-strategy method
that improves upon these variants by replacing exhaustive all-subsets testing
with targeted tests guided by BOSS, yielding well-formed PAGs with higher
precision and efficiency. Finally, we propose a simple heuristic, LV-Dumb (also
known as BOSS-POD), which bypasses latent-variable-specific reasoning and
directly returns the PAG of the BOSS DAG. Although not strictly correct in the
FCI sense, it scales better and often achieves superior accuracy in practice.
Simulations and real-data analyses demonstrate that BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI
provide sound baselines, FCIT improves both efficiency and reliability, and
LV-Dumb offers a practical heuristic with strong empirical performance.
Together, these method highlight the value of score-guided and targeted
strategies for scalable latent-variable causal discovery.

Conclusion: FairAgent使公平感知的机器学习对从业者更加易于使用和访问。

Abstract: Training fair and unbiased machine learning models is crucial for high-stakes
applications, yet it presents significant challenges. Effective bias mitigation
requires deep expertise in fairness definitions, metrics, data preprocessing,
and machine learning techniques. In addition, the complex process of balancing
model performance with fairness requirements while properly handling sensitive
attributes makes fairness-aware model development inaccessible to many
practitioners. To address these challenges, we introduce FairAgent, an
LLM-powered automated system that significantly simplifies fairness-aware model
development. FairAgent eliminates the need for deep technical expertise by
automatically analyzing datasets for potential biases, handling data
preprocessing and feature engineering, and implementing appropriate bias
mitigation strategies based on user requirements. Our experiments demonstrate
that FairAgent achieves significant performance improvements while
significantly reducing development time and expertise requirements, making
fairness-aware machine learning more accessible to practitioners.

Motivation: 许多高风险AI应用针对低发生率事件，表面准确性可能掩盖实际价值有限的问题，需要专门框架来评估罕见事件识别AI模型。

Method: 提出结构化案例级检查方法，结合统计性能评估，开发采购清单，并在药物警戒领域实例化该框架，包括规则检索、重复检测和LLM自动编辑三个研究。

Conclusion: 虽然基于药物警戒实践，但该框架的原则适用于阳性样本稀少且错误成本可能不对称的领域，为罕见事件识别AI模型提供了全面评估方法。

Abstract: Many high-stakes AI applications target low-prevalence events, where apparent
accuracy can conceal limited real-world value. Relevant AI models range from
expert-defined rules and traditional machine learning to generative LLMs
constrained for classification. We outline key considerations for critical
appraisal of AI in rare-event recognition, including problem framing and test
set design, prevalence-aware statistical evaluation, robustness assessment, and
integration into human workflows. In addition, we propose an approach to
structured case-level examination (SCLE), to complement statistical performance
evaluation, and a comprehensive checklist to guide procurement or development
of AI models for rare-event recognition. We instantiate the framework in
pharmacovigilance, drawing on three studies: rule-based retrieval of
pregnancy-related reports; duplicate detection combining machine learning with
probabilistic record linkage; and automated redaction of person names using an
LLM. We highlight pitfalls specific to the rare-event setting including
optimism from unrealistic class balance and lack of difficult positive controls
in test sets - and show how cost-sensitive targets align model performance with
operational value. While grounded in pharmacovigilance practice, the principles
generalize to domains where positives are scarce and error costs may be
asymmetric.

frontier models are approaching industry experts in deliverable quality. We
analyze the potential for frontier models, when paired with human oversight, to
perform GDPval tasks cheaper and faster than unaided experts. We also
demonstrate that increased reasoning effort, increased task context, and
increased scaffolding improves model performance on GDPval. Finally, we
open-source a gold subset of 220 tasks and provide a public automated grading

Motivation: 传统固定加权损失在稀疏领域效果有限，单一权重无法应对交互极少的领域，训练信号容易被通用数据集稀释

Method: 基于数据驱动的动态加权损失函数，根据训练数据中每个领域的稀疏度自适应调整损失权重，稀疏领域权重更高，密集领域权重更低

Conclusion: 动态加权损失函数能有效提升稀疏领域推荐性能，理论分析和实证验证均证明其优越性

Abstract: The effectiveness of single-model sequential recommendation architectures,
while scalable, is often limited when catering to "power users" in sparse or
niche domains. Our previous research, PinnerFormerLite, addressed this by using
a fixed weighted loss to prioritize specific domains. However, this approach
can be sub-optimal, as a single, uniform weight may not be sufficient for
domains with very few interactions, where the training signal is easily diluted
by the vast, generic dataset.
  This paper proposes a novel, data-driven approach: a Dynamic Weighted Loss
function with comprehensive theoretical foundations and extensive empirical
validation. We introduce an adaptive algorithm that adjusts the loss weight for
each domain based on its sparsity in the training data, assigning a higher
weight to sparser domains and a lower weight to denser ones. This ensures that
even rare user interests contribute a meaningful gradient signal, preventing
them from being overshadowed.
  We provide rigorous theoretical analysis including convergence proofs,
complexity analysis, and bounds analysis to establish the stability and
efficiency of our approach. Our comprehensive empirical validation across four
diverse datasets (MovieLens, Amazon Electronics, Yelp Business, LastFM Music)
with state-of-the-art baselines (SIGMA, CALRec, SparseEnNet) demonstrates that
this dynamic weighting system significantly outperforms all comparison methods,
particularly for sparse domains, achieving substantial lifts in key metrics
like Recall at 10 and NDCG at 10 while maintaining performance on denser
domains and introducing minimal computational overhead.

Abstract: Graph diffusion models have made significant progress in learning structured
graph data and have demonstrated strong potential for predictive tasks.
Existing approaches typically embed node, edge, and graph-level features into a
unified latent space, modeling prediction tasks including classification and
regression as a form of conditional generation. However, due to the
non-Euclidean nature of graph data, features of different curvatures are
entangled in the same latent space without releasing their geometric potential.
To address this issue, we aim to construt an ideal Riemannian diffusion model
to capture distinct manifold signatures of complex graph data and learn their
distribution. This goal faces two challenges: numerical instability caused by
exponential mapping during the encoding proces and manifold deviation during
diffusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GeoMancer: a
novel Riemannian graph diffusion framework for both generation and prediction
tasks. To mitigate numerical instability, we replace exponential mapping with
an isometric-invariant Riemannian gyrokernel approach and decouple multi-level
features onto their respective task-specific manifolds to learn optimal
representations. To address manifold deviation, we introduce a
manifold-constrained diffusion method and a self-guided strategy for
unconditional generation, ensuring that the generated data remains aligned with
the manifold signature. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our
approach, demonstrating superior performance across a variety of tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了GILT框架，一种无需LLM和微调的图内上下文学习Transformer，解决了图基础模型在处理异构图数据时的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图基础模型面临图数据极端异构性的挑战，包括独特的特征空间、标签集和拓扑结构。现有方法要么依赖LLM但无法处理数值特征，要么需要昂贵的逐图微调。

Method: GILT采用基于token的图内上下文学习框架，将节点、边和图级别的分类任务统一重构，能够处理通用数值特征并动态理解类别语义。

Result: 综合实验表明，GILT在少样本学习场景下表现更优，且所需时间显著少于基于LLM或微调的基线方法。

Conclusion: GILT框架有效解决了图基础模型在处理异构图数据时的效率和泛化问题，提供了一种LLM无关且无需微调的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for precessing relational
data but often struggle to generalize to unseen graphs, giving rise to the
development of Graph Foundational Models (GFMs). However, current GFMs are
challenged by the extreme heterogeneity of graph data, where each graph can
possess a unique feature space, label set, and topology. To address this, two
main paradigms have emerged. The first leverages Large Language Models (LLMs),
but is fundamentally text-dependent, thus struggles to handle the numerical
features in vast graphs. The second pre-trains a structure-based model, but the
adaptation to new tasks typically requires a costly, per-graph tuning stage,
creating a critical efficiency bottleneck. In this work, we move beyond these
limitations and introduce \textbf{G}raph \textbf{I}n-context \textbf{L}earning
\textbf{T}ransformer (GILT), a framework built on an LLM-free and tuning-free
architecture. GILT introduces a novel token-based framework for in-context
learning (ICL) on graphs, reframing classification tasks spanning node, edge
and graph levels in a unified framework. This mechanism is the key to handling
heterogeneity, as it is designed to operate on generic numerical features.
Further, its ability to understand class semantics dynamically from the context
enables tuning-free adaptation. Comprehensive experiments show that GILT
achieves stronger few-shot performance with significantly less time than
LLM-based or tuning-based baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
approach.

TL;DR: LaDiR是一个新颖的推理框架，将连续潜在表示与潜在扩散模型的迭代优化能力结合，用于增强LLM的推理能力。它通过VAE构建结构化潜在推理空间，使用潜在扩散模型进行并行生成和迭代优化推理轨迹。


<details>

Result: 在数学推理和规划基准测试中，LaDiR在准确性、多样性和可解释性方面均优于现有的自回归、基于扩散和潜在推理方法。

Conclusion: LaDiR为文本推理提供了一种新的潜在扩散范式，显著提升了推理过程的效率和多样性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through
chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may
limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner,
which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this
paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning
framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation
with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an
existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of
thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while
offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a
latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens
with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and
iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows
efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the
model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct
evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks.
Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity,
and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent
reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent
diffusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型应用在上下文适应方面存在简洁性偏见（丢失领域洞察）和上下文崩溃（迭代重写导致细节丢失）的问题，需要一种能够保持详细知识并随长上下文模型扩展的解决方案。

Method: ACE框架采用结构化、增量式更新的方式，通过生成、反思和策划三个模块化过程来管理上下文，使其能够积累、优化和组织策略。

Result: 在代理和领域特定基准测试中，ACE在离线（如系统提示）和在线（如代理记忆）上下文优化方面均优于强基线：代理任务提升10.6%，金融任务提升8.6%，同时显著降低了适应延迟和部署成本。

Conclusion: 全面且不断演变的上下文能够实现可扩展、高效且自我改进的大语言模型系统，且开销较低。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications such as agents and domain-specific
reasoning increasingly rely on context adaptation -- modifying inputs with
instructions, strategies, or evidence, rather than weight updates. Prior
approaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops
domain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where
iterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory
introduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context
Engineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that
accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of
generation, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured,
incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with
long-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes
contexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory),
consistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on
finance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost.
Notably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by
leveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches
the top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it
on the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model.
These results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable,
efficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型生成高质量分子几何结构，但推理时计算成本高昂，需要数百次网络评估，成为实际应用中采样大量分子候选者的主要瓶颈。

Method: 直接在SE(3)-等变骨干网络上操作的无训练缓存策略，预测中间隐藏状态，与预训练模型兼容，且与现有基于训练的加速和系统级优化正交。

Result: 在GEOM-Drugs数据集上，缓存方法在匹配样本质量下实现推理时间减半，相比基础模型加速达3倍且样本质量下降最小。结合其他优化可获得高达7倍的加速。

Conclusion: 该缓存策略有效加速分子几何生成，推理性能显著提升，且能与现有优化方法结合获得更大加速效果。

Abstract: Flow matching models generate high-fidelity molecular geometries but incur
significant computational costs during inference, requiring hundreds of network
evaluations. This inference overhead becomes the primary bottleneck when such
models are employed in practice to sample large numbers of molecular
candidates. This work discusses a training-free caching strategy that
accelerates molecular geometry generation by predicting intermediate hidden
states across solver steps. The proposed method operates directly on the
SE(3)-equivariant backbone, is compatible with pretrained models, and is
orthogonal to existing training-based accelerations and system-level
optimizations. Experiments on the GEOM-Drugs dataset demonstrate that caching
achieves a twofold reduction in wall-clock inference time at matched sample
quality and a speedup of up to 3x compared to the base model with minimal
sample quality degradation. Because these gains compound with other
optimizations, applying caching alongside other general, lossless optimizations
yield as much as a 7x speedup.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在改进RevIN方法，通过用鲁棒统计量替换其非鲁棒统计量来提升时间序列预测性能，但发现了更复杂的现实情况。

Method: 通过识别四个理论矛盾来解构各种归一化策略的性能，包括标准RevIN、R²-IN和自适应模型A-IN的对比实验。

Result: 标准RevIN在极端异常值数据集上MSE激增683%，R²-IN意外成为最佳方案，而自适应模型A-IN完全系统性失败。

Conclusion: 提出了时间序列归一化的新警示范式：从盲目追求复杂性转向诊断驱动分析，揭示了简单基线的惊人能力和朴素适应的危险性。

Abstract: Reversible Instance Normalization (RevIN) is a key technique enabling simple
linear models to achieve state-of-the-art performance in time series
forecasting. While replacing its non-robust statistics with robust counterparts
(termed R$^2$-IN) seems like a straightforward improvement, our findings reveal
a far more complex reality. This paper deconstructs the perplexing performance
of various normalization strategies by identifying four underlying theoretical
contradictions. Our experiments provide two crucial findings: first, the
standard RevIN catastrophically fails on datasets with extreme outliers, where
its MSE surges by a staggering 683\%. Second, while the simple R$^2$-IN
prevents this failure and unexpectedly emerges as the best overall performer,
our adaptive model (A-IN), designed to test a diagnostics-driven heuristic,
unexpectedly suffers a complete and systemic failure. This surprising outcome
uncovers a critical, overlooked pitfall in time series analysis: the
instability introduced by a simple or counter-intuitive heuristic can be more
damaging than the statistical issues it aims to solve. The core contribution of
this work is thus a new, cautionary paradigm for time series normalization: a
shift from a blind search for complexity to a diagnostics-driven analysis that
reveals not only the surprising power of simple baselines but also the perilous
nature of naive adaptation.

Method: 提出了三类语义信道均衡器：线性映射（闭式解）、轻量神经网络（更强表达能力）和Parseval框架均衡器（零样本无需训练）。

Result: 通过在AWGN和衰落信道上的图像重建实验，量化了复杂度、数据效率和保真度之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 为在异构AI原生无线网络中部署DeepJSCC提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm for end-to-end semantic communications, jointly learning to compress
and protect task-relevant features over noisy channels. However, existing
DeepJSCC schemes assume a shared latent space at transmitter (TX) and receiver
(RX) - an assumption that fails in multi-vendor deployments where encoders and
decoders cannot be co-trained. This mismatch introduces "semantic noise",
degrading reconstruction quality and downstream task performance. In this
paper, we systematize and evaluate methods for semantic channel equalization
for DeepJSCC, introducing an additional processing stage that aligns
heterogeneous latent spaces under both physical and semantic impairments. We
investigate three classes of aligners: (i) linear maps, which admit closed-form
solutions; (ii) lightweight neural networks, offering greater expressiveness;
and (iii) a Parseval-frame equalizer, which operates in zero-shot mode without
the need for training. Through extensive experiments on image reconstruction
over AWGN and fading channels, we quantify trade-offs among complexity, data
efficiency, and fidelity, providing guidelines for deploying DeepJSCC in
heterogeneous AI-native wireless networks.

Result: 发现模型合并效果是有效噪声的非单调函数，具有明显的最优点。较大的学习率、较强的权重衰减、较小的批量大小和数据增强都能独立调节有效噪声尺度。

Conclusion: 优化器噪声不仅影响单个最小值的平坦度或泛化能力，还影响全局损失景观，能够预测独立训练的解何时可以合并。这些发现拓宽了对优化如何塑造损失景观几何形状及其对模型合并下游影响的理解。

Abstract: Model merging methods combine models with different capabilities into a
single one while maintaining the same inference cost. Two popular approaches
are linear interpolation, which linearly interpolates between model weights,
and task arithmetic, which combines task vectors obtained by the difference
between finetuned and base models. While useful in practice, what properties
make merging effective are poorly understood. This paper explores how the
optimization process affects the loss landscape geometry and its impact on
merging success. We show that a single quantity -- the effective noise scale --
unifies the impact of optimizer and data choices on model merging. Across
architectures and datasets, the effectiveness of merging success is a
non-monotonic function of effective noise, with a distinct optimum. Decomposing
this quantity, we find that larger learning rates, stronger weight decay,
smaller batch sizes, and data augmentation all independently modulate the
effective noise scale, exhibiting the same qualitative trend. Unlike prior work
that connects optimizer noise to the flatness or generalization of individual
minima, we show that it also affects the global loss landscape, predicting when
independently trained solutions can be merged. Our findings broaden the
understanding of how optimization shapes the loss landscape geometry and its
downstream consequences for model merging, suggesting the possibility of
further manipulating the training dynamics to improve merging effectiveness.

Motivation: 许多机器学习算法依赖于不确定性表示的迭代更新，但在存在不精确性和模糊性的情况下，需要研究这些迭代过程是否收敛到稳定固定点，以及什么条件下可以保证这种收敛性。

Method: 使用credal sets（概率分布的闭凸集）作为不精确概率信念的表示框架，分析迭代更新规则在credal sets上的收敛性，并以Credal Bayesian Deep Learning作为具体示例进行说明。

Result: 研究表明，将不精确性纳入学习过程不仅丰富了不确定性表示，还揭示了稳定性出现的结构条件，为不精确性下的迭代学习动态提供了新的见解。

Conclusion: 该工作首次系统分析了不精确概率机器学习中迭代更新的收敛性问题，证明了在特定条件下credal sets的更新过程可以收敛到稳定固定点，为理解不精确性下的学习动态提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms rely on iterative updates of uncertainty
representations, ranging from variational inference and
expectation-maximization, to reinforcement learning, continual learning, and
multi-agent learning. In the presence of imprecision and ambiguity, credal sets
-- closed, convex sets of probability distributions -- have emerged as a
popular framework for representing imprecise probabilistic beliefs. Under such
imprecision, many learning problems in imprecise probabilistic machine learning
(IPML) may be viewed as processes involving successive applications of update
rules on credal sets. This naturally raises the question of whether this
iterative process converges to stable fixed points -- or, more generally, under
what conditions on the updating mechanism such fixed points exist, and whether
they can be attained. We provide the first analysis of this problem and
illustrate our findings using Credal Bayesian Deep Learning as a concrete
example. Our work demonstrates that incorporating imprecision into the learning
process not only enriches the representation of uncertainty, but also reveals
structural conditions under which stability emerges, thereby offering new
insights into the dynamics of iterative learning under imprecision.

Motivation: 现有的基于优化的LLM遗忘方法（如NPO）由于缺乏显式正偏好信号而效果受限，需要领域特定知识或精心设计的提示来构建偏好响应，限制了方法的通用性。

Method: 提出DiPO算法，将关注点从完整响应转移到分布层面，直接针对下一个token概率分布进行操作。通过选择性放大或抑制模型高置信度输出logits来构建所需的偏好分布对。

Result: DiPO在TOFU基准测试中达到最高的遗忘质量，在MUSE基准测试中保持领先的可扩展性和效用保持可持续性，实现了模型效用与遗忘质量之间的良好平衡。

Conclusion: DiPO通过分布层面的偏好优化有效克服了现有LLM遗忘方法的局限性，为数据隐私和安全提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities learned
from vast corpora, concerns regarding data privacy and safety are receiving
increasing attention. LLM unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of
specific data while preserving overall model utility, is becoming an important
research area. One of the mainstream unlearning classes is optimization-based
methods, which achieve forgetting directly through fine-tuning, exemplified by
Negative Preference Optimization (NPO). However, NPO's effectiveness is limited
by its inherent lack of explicit positive preference signals. Attempts to
introduce such signals by constructing preferred responses often necessitate
domain-specific knowledge or well-designed prompts, fundamentally restricting
their generalizability. In this paper, we shift the focus to the
distribution-level, directly targeting the next-token probability distribution
instead of entire responses, and derive a novel unlearning algorithm termed
\textbf{Di}stribution \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization (DiPO). We show
that the requisite preference distribution pairs for DiPO, which are
distributions over the model's output tokens, can be constructed by selectively
amplifying or suppressing the model's high-confidence output logits, thereby
effectively overcoming NPO's limitations. We theoretically prove the
consistency of DiPO's loss function with the desired unlearning direction.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiPO achieves a strong trade-off between
model utility and forget quality. Notably, DiPO attains the highest forget
quality on the TOFU benchmark, and maintains leading scalability and
sustainability in utility preservation on the MUSE benchmark.

Conclusion: 测试时课程学习展示了在测试时对数千个任务相关经验进行持续训练的潜力，显著提高了模型性能上限。

Abstract: Humans are good at learning on the job: We learn how to solve the tasks we
face as we go along. Can a model do the same? We propose an agent that
assembles a task-specific curriculum, called test-time curriculum (TTC-RL), and
applies reinforcement learning to continue training the model for its target
task. The test-time curriculum avoids time-consuming human curation of datasets
by automatically selecting the most task-relevant data from a large pool of
available training data. Our experiments demonstrate that reinforcement
learning on a test-time curriculum consistently improves the model on its
target tasks, across a variety of evaluations and models. Notably, on
challenging math and coding benchmarks, TTC-RL improves the pass@1 of Qwen3-8B
by approximately 1.8x on AIME25 and 2.1x on CodeElo. Moreover, we find that
TTC-RL significantly raises the performance ceiling compared to the initial
model, increasing pass@8 on AIME25 from 40% to 62% and on CodeElo from 28% to
43%. Our findings show the potential of test-time curricula in extending the
test-time scaling paradigm to continual training on thousands of task-relevant

Conclusion: ESCIM方法通过因果推断有效解决了CVR预测中的样本稀疏问题，提高了模型性能并展示了良好的泛化能力

Abstract: Accurately predicting conversion rate (CVR) is essential in various
recommendation domains such as online advertising systems and e-commerce. These
systems utilize user interaction logs, which consist of exposures, clicks, and
conversions. CVR prediction models are typically trained solely based on
clicked samples, as conversions can only be determined following clicks.
However, the sparsity of clicked instances necessitates the collection of a
substantial amount of logs for effective model training. Recent works address
this issue by devising frameworks that leverage non-clicked samples. While
these frameworks aim to reduce biases caused by the discrepancy between clicked
and non-clicked samples, they often rely on heuristics. Against this
background, we propose a method to counterfactually generate conversion labels
for non-clicked samples by using causality as a guiding principle, attempting
to answer the question, "Would the user have converted if he or she had clicked
the recommended item?" Our approach is named the Entire Space Counterfactual
Inference Multi-task Model (ESCIM). We initially train a structural causal
model (SCM) of user sequential behaviors and conduct a hypothetical
intervention (i.e., click) on non-clicked items to infer counterfactual CVRs.
We then introduce several approaches to transform predicted counterfactual CVRs
into binary counterfactual conversion labels for the non-clicked samples.
Finally, the generated samples are incorporated into the training process.
Extensive experiments on public datasets illustrate the superiority of the
proposed algorithm. Online A/B testing further empirically validates the
effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in real-world scenarios. In addition,
we demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed method on latent
conversion data, showcasing its robustness and superior generalization
capabilities.

Motivation: 开发一种基于键的分子指纹作为现有原子中心指纹（如ECFP）的补充，以提升脑血屏障穿透性预测的性能。

Method: 提出静态BCFP指纹，采用类似ChemProp的键卷积方法，使用快速随机森林模型，并开发BCFP-Sort&Slice特征组合方案来保留OOV计数信息。

Result: 在分层交叉验证中，ECFP与BCFP的拼接相比单独使用任一描述符都能持续提升AUROC和AUPRC，且r=1时性能最佳。该方法在BBBP评估中超越了MGTP预测。

Conclusion: 轻量级的键中心描述符能够补充原子中心圆形指纹，为BBBP预测提供强大快速的基线方法。

Abstract: Bond Centered FingerPrint (BCFP) are a complementary, bond-centric
alternative to Extended-Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP). We introduce a static
BCFP that mirrors the bond-convolution used by directed message-passing GNNs
like ChemProp, and evaluate it with a fast rapid Random Forest model on
Brain-Blood Barrier Penetration (BBBP) classification task. Across stratified
cross-validation, concatenating ECFP with BCFP consistently improves AUROC and
AUPRC over either descriptor alone, as confirmed by Turkey HSD
multiple-comparison analysis. Among radii, r = 1 performs best; r = 2 does not
yield statistically separable gains under the same test. We further propose
BCFP-Sort&Slice, a simple feature-combination scheme that preserves the
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) count information native to ECFP count vectors while
enabling compact unhashed concatenation of BCFP variants. We also outperform
the MGTP prediction on our BBBP evaluation, using such composite new features
bond and atom features. These results show that lightweight, bond-centered
descriptors can complement atom-centered circular fingerprints and provide
strong, fast baselines for BBBP prediction.

Abstract: Causal Abstraction (CA) theory provides a principled framework for relating
causal models that describe the same system at different levels of granularity
while ensuring interventional consistency between them. Recently, several
approaches for learning CAs have been proposed, but all assume fixed and
well-specified exogenous distributions, making them vulnerable to environmental
shifts and misspecification. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing the first class of distributionally robust CAs and their associated
learning algorithms. The latter cast robust causal abstraction learning as a
constrained min-max optimization problem with Wasserstein ambiguity sets. We
provide theoretical results, for both empirical and Gaussian environments,
leading to principled selection of the level of robustness via the radius of
these sets. Furthermore, we present empirical evidence across different
problems and CA learning methods, demonstrating our framework's robustness not
only to environmental shifts but also to structural model and intervention
mapping misspecification.

TL;DR: 本文识别了自进化LLM代理的对齐倾斜过程(ATP)风险，即持续交互导致代理放弃训练时建立的对齐约束，转向强化自利策略。实验显示对齐收益在自进化下迅速侵蚀，多智能体环境中违规行为快速扩散，现有强化学习对齐方法防御脆弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理获得自进化能力，其长期可靠性成为关键问题。作者关注训练后部署阶段独特的ATP风险，即持续交互驱动代理放弃对齐约束，转向自利策略。

Method: 通过两种互补范式形式化分析ATP：自利探索（重复高奖励偏差诱导个体行为漂移）和模仿策略扩散（异常行为在多智能体系统中传播）。构建可控测试平台，在Qwen3-8B和Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct上基准测试。

Result: 实验表明：1）自进化下对齐收益迅速侵蚀，初始对齐模型收敛到未对齐状态；2）多智能体环境中成功违规快速扩散，导致集体未对齐；3）当前基于强化学习的对齐方法仅提供脆弱防御。

Conclusion: LLM代理的对齐不是静态属性，而是脆弱动态的，在部署期间易受反馈驱动衰减影响。对齐倾斜过程揭示了自进化代理的长期可靠性风险。

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly gain self-evolutionary
capabilities to adapt and refine their strategies through real-world
interaction, their long-term reliability becomes a critical concern. We
identify the Alignment Tipping Process (ATP), a critical post-deployment risk
unique to self-evolving LLM agents. Unlike training-time failures, ATP arises
when continual interaction drives agents to abandon alignment constraints
established during training in favor of reinforced, self-interested strategies.
We formalize and analyze ATP through two complementary paradigms:
Self-Interested Exploration, where repeated high-reward deviations induce
individual behavioral drift, and Imitative Strategy Diffusion, where deviant
behaviors spread across multi-agent systems. Building on these paradigms, we
construct controllable testbeds and benchmark Qwen3-8B and
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct. Our experiments show that alignment benefits erode
rapidly under self-evolution, with initially aligned models converging toward
unaligned states. In multi-agent settings, successful violations diffuse
quickly, leading to collective misalignment. Moreover, current reinforcement
learning-based alignment methods provide only fragile defenses against
alignment tipping. Together, these findings demonstrate that alignment of LLM
agents is not a static property but a fragile and dynamic one, vulnerable to
feedback-driven decay during deployment. Our data and code are available at
https://github.com/aiming-lab/ATP.

TL;DR: TRM是一种比HRM更简单的递归推理方法，使用仅2层的微型网络（7M参数），在ARC-AGI等难题任务上超越了大多数大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRM虽然在小模型上表现良好但理解不足且可能非最优，需要开发更简单高效的推理方法。

Method: 提出Tiny Recursive Model (TRM)，使用单个微型网络进行递归推理，仅2层7M参数。

Result: TRM在ARC-AGI-1上获得45%测试准确率，ARC-AGI-2上8%，超越大多数LLMs且参数仅为其0.01%。

Conclusion: TRM证明了简单递归方法在小模型上实现强泛化能力的潜力，为高效推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) is a novel approach using two small neural
networks recursing at different frequencies. This biologically inspired method
beats Large Language models (LLMs) on hard puzzle tasks such as Sudoku, Maze,
and ARC-AGI while trained with small models (27M parameters) on small data
(around 1000 examples). HRM holds great promise for solving hard problems with
small networks, but it is not yet well understood and may be suboptimal. We
propose Tiny Recursive Model (TRM), a much simpler recursive reasoning approach
that achieves significantly higher generalization than HRM, while using a
single tiny network with only 2 layers. With only 7M parameters, TRM obtains
45% test-accuracy on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2, higher than most LLMs
(e.g., Deepseek R1, o3-mini, Gemini 2.5 Pro) with less than 0.01% of the
parameters.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了7种基于不同数据源（EHR数据和ICD-10代码）发现疾病关联的方法，发现LLM方法产生的疾病关联多样性最低，表明其在发现新关联方面潜力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分析大规模临床数据识别疾病关联存在劳动密集、主观性强和专家意见分歧的问题。机器学习虽有潜力，但在方法选择、数据源选择和缺乏"真实标签"方面面临挑战。

Method: 系统评估7种方法：统计共现分析和MLM方法（基于临床数据）、领域特定BERT变体、通用BERT和文档检索、4种LLM。使用两种数据源：MIMIC-IV EHR中的ICD-10代码序列和完整ICD-10代码集（含/不含文本描述）。

Result: 基于图的比较显示，LLM方法产生的ICD代码关联多样性最低，低于基于文本和领域特定方法。在缺乏医学关联真实标签的情况下，研究结果构成了有价值的医学疾病本体。

Conclusion: LLM在发现新疾病关联方面潜力有限。研究结果为未来临床研究和医疗AI应用提供了基础资源。

Abstract: Identifying disease interconnections through manual analysis of large-scale
clinical data is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to expert disagreement.
While machine learning (ML) shows promise, three critical challenges remain:
(1) selecting optimal methods from the vast ML landscape, (2) determining
whether real-world clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, EHRs) or
structured disease descriptions yield more reliable insights, (3) the lack of
"ground truth," as some disease interconnections remain unexplored in medicine.
Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate broad utility, yet they often lack
specialized medical knowledge. To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of seven approaches for uncovering disease relationships based on
two data sources: (i) sequences of ICD-10 codes from MIMIC-IV EHRs and (ii) the
full set of ICD-10 codes, both with and without textual descriptions. Our
framework integrates the following: (i) a statistical co-occurrence analysis
and a masked language modeling (MLM) approach using real clinical data; (ii)
domain-specific BERT variants (Med-BERT and BioClinicalBERT); (iii) a
general-purpose BERT and document retrieval; and (iv) four LLMs (Mistral,
DeepSeek, Qwen, and YandexGPT). Our graph-based comparison of the obtained
interconnection matrices shows that the LLM-based approach produces
interconnections with the lowest diversity of ICD code connections to different
diseases compared to other methods, including text-based and domain-based
approaches. This suggests an important implication: LLMs have limited potential
for discovering new interconnections. In the absence of ground truth databases
for medical interconnections between ICD codes, our results constitute a
valuable medical disease ontology that can serve as a foundational resource for
future clinical research and artificial intelligence applications in
healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技能发现算法往往忽略强化学习问题中存在的自然状态变量，导致发现的技能缺乏对特定状态变量的控制，这会显著影响探索效率、增加学习难度，并在目标不明确的下游任务中产生负面影响。

Method: 引入一种通用方法，使技能发现算法能够学习专注于特定状态变量的技能，即目标明确、控制特定状态变量的技能。

Result: 该方法将状态空间覆盖率提高了三倍，解锁了新的学习能力，并自动避免了在下游任务中的负面影响。

Conclusion: 通过学习专注于控制特定状态变量的技能，可以显著提升强化学习中的探索效率和学习效果，同时避免下游任务中的负面效应。

Abstract: Skills are essential for unlocking higher levels of problem solving. A common
approach to discovering these skills is to learn ones that reliably reach
different states, thus empowering the agent to control its environment.
However, existing skill discovery algorithms often overlook the natural state
variables present in many reinforcement learning problems, meaning that the
discovered skills lack control of specific state variables. This can
significantly hamper exploration efficiency, make skills more challenging to
learn with, and lead to negative side effects in downstream tasks when the goal
is under-specified. We introduce a general method that enables these skill
discovery algorithms to learn focused skills -- skills that target and control
specific state variables. Our approach improves state space coverage by a
factor of three, unlocks new learning capabilities, and automatically avoids
negative side effects in downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Glocal-IB训练范式，通过全局对齐损失解决高缺失率下时间序列插值模型的优化困境，提升模型泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列插值模型在高缺失率下容易过拟合局部噪声，导致推理阶段生成差的插值结果和扭曲的潜在表示分布，缺乏全局信息指导

Method: 提出Glocal-IB训练范式，在标准信息瓶颈框架基础上引入全局对齐损失，通过可处理的互信息近似对齐掩码输入与原始观测输入的潜在表示

Result: 在九个数据集上的广泛实验证实，Glocal-IB在高缺失率下带来一致的性能提升和更对齐的潜在表示

Conclusion: Glocal-IB能够帮助模型在保留全局结构和局部细节的同时抑制缺失值引起的噪声，显著提升在高缺失率下的泛化能力

Abstract: Time Series Imputation (TSI), which aims to recover missing values in
temporal data, remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex and often
high-rate missingness in real-world scenarios. Existing models typically
optimize the point-wise reconstruction loss, focusing on recovering numerical
values (local information). However, we observe that under high missing rates,
these models still perform well in the training phase yet produce poor
imputations and distorted latent representation distributions (global
information) in the inference phase. This reveals a critical optimization
dilemma: current objectives lack global guidance, leading models to overfit
local noise and fail to capture global information of the data. To address this
issue, we propose a new training paradigm, Glocal Information Bottleneck
(Glocal-IB). Glocal-IB is model-agnostic and extends the standard IB framework
by introducing a Global Alignment loss, derived from a tractable mutual
information approximation. This loss aligns the latent representations of
masked inputs with those of their originally observed counterparts. It helps
the model retain global structure and local details while suppressing noise
caused by missing values, giving rise to better generalization under high
missingness. Extensive experiments on nine datasets confirm that Glocal-IB
leads to consistently improved performance and aligned latent representations
under missingness. Our code implementation is available in
https://github.com/Muyiiiii/NeurIPS-25-Glocal-IB.

TL;DR: FedSSL-AMC：一种结合联邦学习和自监督学习的自动调制分类方法，通过无标签I/Q序列训练因果时间膨胀CNN，再在客户端用小样本标签数据训练SVM分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式训练自动调制分类模型存在隐私泄露、通信开销大、对信道变化鲁棒性差等问题。联邦学习虽然避免了数据集中，但仍受类别不平衡、非独立同分布数据分布和标签样本有限的限制。

Method: 提出FedSSL-AMC方法：1）在客户端使用三元组损失自监督学习训练因果时间膨胀CNN；2）在每个客户端使用少量标签数据训练SVM分类器；3）建立了联邦表示学习过程的收敛性和下游分类器在特征噪声下的可分离性保证。

Result: 在合成和空中数据集上的实验表明，该方法在异构信噪比、载波频率偏移和非独立同分布标签划分条件下，相比监督联邦学习基线方法取得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: FedSSL-AMC通过结合联邦学习和自监督学习，有效解决了自动调制分类中的隐私保护、数据分布异构性和标签稀缺问题，为无线通信中的调制识别提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Training automatic modulation classification (AMC) models on centrally
aggregated data raises privacy concerns, incurs communication overhead, and
often fails to confer robustness to channel shifts. Federated learning (FL)
avoids central aggregation by training on distributed clients but remains
sensitive to class imbalance, non-IID client distributions, and limited labeled
samples. We propose FedSSL-AMC, which trains a causal, time-dilated CNN with
triplet-loss self-supervision on unlabeled I/Q sequences across clients,
followed by per-client SVMs on small labeled sets. We establish convergence of
the federated representation learning procedure and a separability guarantee
for the downstream classifier under feature noise. Experiments on synthetic and
over-the-air datasets show consistent gains over supervised FL baselines under
heterogeneous SNR, carrier-frequency offsets, and non-IID label partitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经架构搜索(NAS)的性能评估成本高昂，且现有方法大多局限于基于单元的搜索空间和特定图编码，缺乏灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 创建ONNX-Bench基准，将所有开源NAS基准网络转换为统一ONNX格式，提出基于自然语言描述的ONNX-Net文本编码来表示任意神经网络架构。

Result: 实验显示该方法在零样本设置下跨不同搜索空间表现优异，仅需少量预训练样本即可实现对任意神经网络架构的即时性能评估。

Conclusion: ONNX-Bench和ONNX-Net提供了通用的神经网络表示方法，突破了传统NAS方法的搜索空间限制，实现了跨架构的灵活性能预测。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) automates the design process of
high-performing architectures, but remains bottlenecked by expensive
performance evaluation. Most existing studies that achieve faster evaluation
are mostly tied to cell-based search spaces and graph encodings tailored to
those individual search spaces, limiting their flexibility and scalability when
applied to more expressive search spaces. In this work, we aim to close the gap
of individual search space restrictions and search space dependent network
representations. We present ONNX-Bench, a benchmark consisting of a collection
of neural networks in a unified format based on ONNX files. ONNX-Bench includes
all open-source NAS-bench-based neural networks, resulting in a total size of
more than 600k {architecture, accuracy} pairs. This benchmark allows creating a
shared neural network representation, ONNX-Net, able to represent any neural
architecture using natural language descriptions acting as an input to a
performance predictor. This text-based encoding can accommodate arbitrary layer
types, operation parameters, and heterogeneous topologies, enabling a single
surrogate to generalise across all neural architectures rather than being
confined to cell-based search spaces. Experiments show strong zero-shot
performance across disparate search spaces using only a small amount of
pretraining samples, enabling the unprecedented ability to evaluate any neural
network architecture instantly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当约束优化问题的参数不确定时，预测的参数可能导致不可行解，因此需要同时管理可行性和决策质量。

Method: 基于最大似然估计推导了两个损失函数：一个惩罚不可行性，另一个惩罚次优决策，并通过可调参数形成加权平均。

Result: 实验表明调整参数可以在次优性和可行性之间进行权衡，并且对于特定参数值，该方法在多个优化问题实例上与现有基线表现相当。

Conclusion: 该框架为决策者提供了在可行性和决策质量之间平衡的控制能力，适用于通用的约束优化问题。

Abstract: When some parameters of a constrained optimization problem (COP) are
uncertain, this gives rise to a predict-then-optimize (PtO) problem, comprising
two stages -- the prediction of the unknown parameters from contextual
information and the subsequent optimization using those predicted parameters.
Decision-focused learning (DFL) implements the first stage by training a
machine learning (ML) model to optimize the quality of the decisions made using
the predicted parameters. When parameters in the constraints of a COP are
predicted, the predicted parameters can lead to infeasible solutions.
Therefore, it is important to simultaneously manage both feasibility and
decision quality. We develop a DFL framework for predicting constraint
parameters in a generic COP. While prior works typically assume that the
underlying optimization problem is a linear program (LP) or integer linear
program (ILP), our approach makes no such assumption. We derive two novel loss
functions based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE): the first one penalizes
infeasibility (by penalizing when the predicted parameters lead to infeasible
solutions), and the second one penalizes suboptimal decisions (by penalizing
when the true optimal solution is infeasible under the predicted parameters).
We introduce a single tunable parameter to form a weighted average of the two
losses, allowing decision-makers to balance suboptimality and feasibility. We
experimentally demonstrate that adjusting this parameter provides a
decision-maker the control over the trade-off between the two. Moreover, across
several COP instances, we find that for a single value of the tunable
parameter, our method matches the performance of the existing baselines on
suboptimality and feasibility.

Motivation: 传统RL方法在LLMs推理任务中因固定均匀采样导致梯度估计不稳定，需要动态分配推理预算来最小化随机梯度方差

Method: 采用在线连续消除过程交替进行估计和采样，自动停止收集到足够信号的提示，通过固定大小分组和全局统计计算优势基线来稳定更新

Result: 在多个模型架构和推理基准测试中，相比GRPO方法加速了收敛并提高了最终性能，特别是使用平衡采样变体时

Conclusion: 强调方差感知的自适应数据策展在实现高效可靠LLMs强化学习中的核心作用

Abstract: Reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) for reasoning
tasks is often bottlenecked by unstable gradient estimates due to fixed and
uniform sampling of responses across prompts. Prior work such as GVM-RAFT
addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to
minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by
this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for
online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort
to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike
conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation
and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically
stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize
updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute
advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive
sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and
reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and
improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced
sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware,
adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement
learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了TS-SA算法，将随机逼近(SA)融入Thompson采样框架，通过时间平均来近似平稳后验分布，解决了现有近似Thompson采样方法中需要每轮调整超参数的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有近似Thompson采样算法需要在不同轮次中近似不同的后验分布，这要求动态调整学习率等超参数，给理论分析和实际实现带来困难。

Method: TS-SA在每轮中仅使用最近的奖励构建后验近似，执行Langevin Monte Carlo更新，并应用SA步骤对时间上的噪声提议进行平均，从而在整个算法中近似平稳后验目标。

Result: 建立了接近最优的遗憾界，理论分析更简化直观，实证结果显示即使单步Langevin更新在预热后也能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TS-SA通过随机逼近实现了固定步长、统一收敛分析框架和通过时间平均改进的后验估计，解决了近似Thompson采样中的非平稳性问题。

Abstract: Most existing approximate Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithms for multi-armed
bandits use Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) or its variants in
each round to sample from the posterior, relaxing the need for conjugacy
assumptions between priors and reward distributions in vanilla TS. However,
they often require approximating a different posterior distribution in
different round of the bandit problem. This requires tricky, round-specific
tuning of hyperparameters such as dynamic learning rates, causing challenges in
both theoretical analysis and practical implementation. To alleviate this
non-stationarity, we introduce TS-SA, which incorporates stochastic
approximation (SA) within the TS framework. In each round, TS-SA constructs a
posterior approximation only using the most recent reward(s), performs a
Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) update, and applies an SA step to average noisy
proposals over time. This can be interpreted as approximating a stationary
posterior target throughout the entire algorithm, which further yields a fixed
step-size, a unified convergence analysis framework, and improved posterior
estimates through temporal averaging. We establish near-optimal regret bounds
for TS-SA, with a simplified and more intuitive theoretical analysis enabled by
interpreting the entire algorithm as a simulation of a stationary SGLD process.
Our empirical results demonstrate that even a single-step Langevin update with
certain warm-up outperforms existing methods substantially on bandit tasks.

Conclusion: GAD模型为图信号生成提供了一种通用有效的解决方案，能够处理各种图结构数据。

Abstract: We study the problem of generating graph signals from unknown distributions
defined over given graphs, relevant to domains such as recommender systems or
sensor networks. Our approach builds on generative diffusion models, which are
well established in vision and graph generation but remain underexplored for
graph signals. Existing methods lack generality, either ignoring the graph
structure in the forward process or designing graph-aware mechanisms tailored
to specific domains. We adopt a forward process that incorporates the graph
through the heat equation. Rather than relying on the standard formulation, we
consider a time-warped coefficient to mitigate the exponential decay of the
drift term, yielding a graph-aware generative diffusion model (GAD). We analyze
its forward dynamics, proving convergence to a Gaussian Markov random field
with covariance parametrized by the graph Laplacian, and interpret the backward
dynamics as a sequence of graph-signal denoising problems. Finally, we
demonstrate the advantages of GAD on synthetic data, real traffic speed
measurements, and a temperature sensor network.

TL;DR: 本文发现基于扩散的大语言模型(dLLMs)隐含学习了半自回归专家混合，提出了HEX方法通过集成不同块大小生成路径来提升推理性能，无需额外训练即可显著提升多个推理基准的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的dLLMs在推理时通常采用固定的生成顺序，这未能充分利用模型隐含学习的多样化专家行为，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出HEX方法，通过多数投票集成不同块大小生成路径，避免单一固定生成顺序的失败模式。

Result: 在GSM8K上准确率从24.72%提升至88.10%(3.56倍)，在MATH上从16.40%提升至40.00%，在ARC-C上从54.18%提升至87.80%，在TruthfulQA上从28.36%提升至57.46%。

Conclusion: HEX为dLLMs建立了测试时扩展的新范式，揭示了掩码顺序在推理性能中的关键作用。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are trained flexibly to model
extreme dependence in the data distribution; however, how to best utilize this
information at inference time remains an open problem. In this work, we uncover
an interesting property of these models: dLLMs trained on textual data
implicitly learn a mixture of semi-autoregressive experts, where different
generation orders reveal different specialized behaviors. We show that
committing to any single, fixed inference time schedule, a common practice,
collapses performance by failing to leverage this latent ensemble. To address
this, we introduce HEX (Hidden semiautoregressive EXperts for test-time
scaling), a training-free inference method that ensembles across heterogeneous
block schedules. By doing a majority vote over diverse block-sized generation
paths, HEX robustly avoids failure modes associated with any single fixed
schedule. On reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, it boosts accuracy by up to
3.56X (from 24.72% to 88.10%), outperforming top-K margin inference and
specialized fine-tuned methods like GRPO, without additional training. HEX even
yields significant gains on MATH benchmark from 16.40% to 40.00%, scientific
reasoning on ARC-C from 54.18% to 87.80%, and TruthfulQA from 28.36% to 57.46%.
Our results establish a new paradigm for test-time scaling in diffusion-based
LLMs (dLLMs), revealing that the sequence in which masking is performed plays a
critical role in determining performance during inference.

existing architectures without sacrificing predictive performance. HybridFlow
improves upon previous uncertainty quantification frameworks across a range of
regression tasks, such as depth estimation, a collection of regression
benchmarks, and a scientific case study of ice sheet emulation. We also provide
empirical results of the quantified uncertainty, showing that the uncertainty
quantified by HybridFlow is calibrated and better aligns with model error than
existing methods for quantifying aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty.
HybridFlow addresses a key challenge in Bayesian deep learning, unifying
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty modeling in a single robust framework.

*Avichal Goel,Yoon Kim,Nir Shavit,Tony T. Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT)方法，让微调后的语言模型能够用自然语言描述自身的权重变化，从而提高模型修改的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调语言模型时产生的权重变化通常难以解释，而微调数据集往往不可公开获取或过于庞大，需要一种方法来理解这些权重变化。

Method: 使用合成的带标签权重差异数据训练DIT适配器，该适配器可应用于兼容的微调模型，使其能够描述自身的变化。

Result: 在两个概念验证场景（报告隐藏行为和总结微调知识）中，该方法使模型能够用准确的自然语言描述其微调引起的修改。

Conclusion: DIT方法成功实现了让模型自我描述权重变化的目标，为理解模型微调过程提供了新的可解释性工具。

Abstract: Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating
their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and
domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are
not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a
sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not
publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of
comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce
Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their
own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled
weight diffs to train a DIT adapter, which can be applied to a compatible
finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two
proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned
knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced
modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了BVPO方法，通过混合高方差的轨迹梯度和低方差的空轨迹梯度来优化大型推理模型的偏好对齐，减少训练方差并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在生成推理轨迹时，偏好对齐的计算难以处理，通常采用单次采样轨迹优化，这会引入显著的梯度方差。

Method: 提出BVPO方法，混合轨迹梯度估计器和空轨迹梯度估计器，通过理论分析找到最小化均方误差的混合权重。

Result: 在AlpacaEval~2上提升7.8分，Arena-Hard上提升6.8分，六个数学推理基准平均提升4.0分。

Conclusion: 轨迹采样方差是主要瓶颈，直接优化偏差-方差权衡能带来更稳定的训练和更强的整体性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) generate intermediate reasoning traces before
producing final answers, yielding strong gains on multi-step and mathematical
tasks. Yet aligning LRMs with human preferences, a crucial prerequisite for
model deployment, remains underexplored. The statistically correct objective
for preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this
computation is intractable in practice. A common workaround optimizes a single
sampled trajectory, which introduces substantial gradient variance from
stochastic trace sampling. To address this challenge, we frame preference
optimization for LRMs through the lens of the bias--variance trade-off and
propose Bias--Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple,
drop-in method that mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based
estimator and a low-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling
reasoning trace generation. Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces
trace-induced variance for any nontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form
choice of the mixing weight that minimizes mean-squared error relative to the
true marginal gradient, and under standard smoothness and step-size conditions,
tightens classical convergence bounds for stochastic gradient descent.
Empirically, BVPO improves alignment over the best baseline by up to 7.8 points
on AlpacaEval~2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Despite being trained only on
general conversational data, BVPO also boosts reasoning performance for base
models by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math reasoning benchmarks.
These results identify variance from trace sampling as a key bottleneck and
demonstrate that directly optimizing the bias--variance trade-off yields more
stable training and stronger overall performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释GNN方法在处理复杂多变的理性子图时面临挑战，限制了在关键决策中的应用。

Method: 采用拓扑框架，使用持久同调识别理性子图，通过理性过滤学习建模自回归生成过程，并引入拓扑差异约束来增强理性子图与无关部分的拓扑区分。

Conclusion: TopInG为图学习提供了有效的拓扑解释框架，在保持高性能的同时显著提升了模型可解释性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable success across various
scientific fields, yet their adoption in critical decision-making is often
hindered by a lack of interpretability. Recently, intrinsically interpretable
GNNs have been studied to provide insights into model predictions by
identifying rationale substructures in graphs. However, existing methods face
challenges when the underlying rationale subgraphs are complex and varied. In
this work, we propose TopInG: Topologically Interpretable Graph Learning, a
novel topological framework that leverages persistent homology to identify
persistent rationale subgraphs. TopInG employs a rationale filtration learning
approach to model an autoregressive generation process of rationale subgraphs,
and introduces a self-adjusted topological constraint, termed topological
discrepancy, to enforce a persistent topological distinction between rationale
subgraphs and irrelevant counterparts. We provide theoretical guarantees that
our loss function is uniquely optimized by the ground truth under specific
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate TopInG's effectiveness in
tackling key challenges, such as handling variform rationale subgraphs,
balancing predictive performance with interpretability, and mitigating spurious
correlations. Results show that our approach improves upon state-of-the-art
methods on both predictive accuracy and interpretation quality.

Motivation: 探索基于图像的生成模型在机械设计中的潜力，为平面连杆机构提供统一的运动综合框架，支持从简单到复杂多种机构类型。

Method: 使用RGB图像表示平面连杆机构，通过共享潜在变分自编码器(VAE)进行运动曲线合成，将轨迹点绘制速度编码为颜色梯度以支持形状和速度条件的运动综合。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the problem of kinematic synthesis for planar
linkages as a cross-domain image generation task. We develop a planar linkages
dataset using RGB image representations, covering a range of mechanisms: from
simple types such as crank-rocker and crank-slider to more complex eight-bar
linkages like Jansen's mechanism. A shared-latent variational autoencoder (VAE)
is employed to explore the potential of image generative models for
synthesizing unseen motion curves and simulating novel kinematics. By encoding
the drawing speed of trajectory points as color gradients, the same
architecture also supports kinematic synthesis conditioned on both trajectory
shape and velocity profiles. We validate our method on three datasets of
increasing complexity: a standard four-bar linkage set, a mixed set of four-bar
and crank-slider mechanisms, and a complex set including multi-loop mechanisms.
Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of image-based
representations for generative mechanical design, showing that mechanisms with
revolute and prismatic joints, and potentially cams and gears, can be
represented and synthesized within a unified image generation framework.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Universal Beta Splatting (UBS) 是一个统一框架，将3D高斯泼溅推广到N维各向异性Beta核，用于显式辐射场渲染。Beta核能在单一表示中建模空间、角度和时间维度的可控依赖关系，优于固定高斯基元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法使用固定高斯基元，限制了其对复杂光传输、各向异性视角依赖外观和场景动态的建模能力。需要一种更通用的基元来统一处理这些不同维度的依赖关系。

Method: 提出使用N维各向异性Beta核作为通用基元，替代传统高斯核。Beta核能自然建模空间、角度和时间维度的依赖关系，无需辅助网络或特定颜色编码。框架保持向后兼容，高斯泼溅是其特例。

Result: UBS在静态、视角依赖和动态基准测试中一致优于现有方法。学习到的Beta参数能自然分解场景属性为可解释的组件：空间（表面vs纹理）、角度（漫反射vs镜面反射）和时间（静态vs动态）。

Conclusion: Beta核作为可扩展的通用基元，为辐射场渲染提供了统一的解决方案，能够处理复杂光传输、各向异性外观和场景动态，同时保持实时渲染性能。

Abstract: We introduce Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that
generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for
explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta
kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and
temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach
captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent
appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or
specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating
to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and
lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene
properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface
vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs.
dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering
while consistently outperforming existing methods across static,
view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable
universal primitive for radiance field rendering. Our project website is

visual appeal of the generated textures.

TL;DR: Paris是首个完全通过去中心化计算预训练的公开扩散模型，展示了无需中心化基础设施即可实现高质量文本到图像生成的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索去中心化训练扩散模型的可能性，消除对专用GPU集群和同步基础设施的依赖，使模型训练能在异构硬件上进行。

Method: 采用分布式扩散训练框架，将数据分区为语义连贯的簇，由8个专家扩散模型独立训练，无需梯度、参数或中间激活同步，通过轻量级transformer路由器在推理时动态选择专家。

Result: Paris在保持生成质量的同时，相比之前的去中心化基线，训练数据减少14倍，计算量减少16倍，生成质量可与中心化协调的基线相媲美。

Conclusion: 去中心化训练扩散模型是可行的，能够在不依赖专用基础设施的情况下实现高质量生成，为更广泛的研究和商业应用打开了可能性。

Abstract: We present Paris, the first publicly released diffusion model pre-trained
entirely through decentralized computation. Paris demonstrates that
high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally
coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use.
Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from
scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters
each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or
intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized
gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically
coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while
collectively approximating the full distribution. A lightweight transformer
router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving
generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating
synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized
interconnects. Empirical validation confirms that Paris's decentralized
training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster
requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using
14$\times$ less training data and 16$\times$ less compute than the prior
decentralized baseline.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Neon是一种新的学习方法，通过负向外推从自训练中解决模型自噬障碍问题，能够显著提升生成模型性能且计算成本极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成AI模型的扩展受到高质量训练数据稀缺的限制。使用合成数据增强真实数据会导致模型自噬障碍，造成样本质量和多样性的快速退化。

Method: Neon首先在自合成数据上微调基础模型，然后反其道而行之，反转梯度更新以从退化权重中进行负向外推。该方法通过简单的后处理合并实现，无需新真实数据。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上，Neon将xAR-L模型提升到新的最先进FID 1.02，仅使用0.36%的额外训练计算。该方法在多种架构和数据集上均表现优异。

Conclusion: Neon通过利用自训练中的退化信号实现自我改进，是一种通用、高效且易于实现的解决方案，能够显著提升生成模型性能。

Abstract: Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality
training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using
(unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the
purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately,
however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder
(MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality
and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation
frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from
self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model,
Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then,
counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the
degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers
that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between
the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation
corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is
remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new
real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically
uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's
universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching,
autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet,
CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the
xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional
training compute. Code is available at https://github.com/SinaAlemohammad/Neon

TL;DR: 提出对比噪声优化方法，通过优化初始噪声而非中间潜在变量来提升文本到图像生成模型的多样性，同时保持保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在文本引导下生成高保真图像，但存在多样性不足的问题，输出容易坍缩到相似模式。现有方法通过优化中间潜在变量或文本条件效果有限且对超参数敏感。

Method: 提出对比噪声优化方法，在Tweedie数据空间定义对比损失，优化一批噪声潜在变量，通过对比优化使批次内实例相互排斥以最大化多样性，同时锚定参考样本以保持保真度。

Result: 在多个T2I骨干模型上的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了更优的质量-多样性帕累托前沿，且对超参数选择具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 对比噪声优化是一种简单有效的预处理方法，能从独特视角解决文本到图像生成中的多样性问题，提供理论洞察支持其有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive performance
in generating high-fidelity images, largely enabled by text-guided inference.
However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited
diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text
guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text
conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or
remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses
the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that
adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote
diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the
Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive
optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while
keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further
provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to
substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I
backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity
Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据高效的管道，通过在基于神经SDF的CAD部件隐式重建网络上添加部件分割头，使用PartField生成的监督进行训练，能够处理任意数量部件的网格并产生几何对齐的标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于固定分类法，无法处理任意数量部件的CAD网格。本文旨在开发一种不受部件数量限制、能够产生连贯几何对齐标签的CAD网格分割方法。

Method: 在Flat-CAD SDF主干上附加轻量级分割头，使用PartField生成的监督进行训练，单次处理即可为任意数量部件的网格生成准确的部件标签。

Result: 在ABC数据集上评估显示，该方法在重建指标（CDL1/CDL2、F1-micro、NC）和分割指标（mIoU、准确率）上表现强劲，同时提出了新的分割一致性指标来捕捉局部标签平滑性。即使在薄壁或复杂几何的重建退化情况下，分割仍保持准确和标签连贯性。

Conclusion: 该方法为语义结构化的CAD网格提供了一条实用路径，无需精心策划的分类法或精确的调色板匹配。讨论了边界精度的局限性，并提出了边界感知训练和更高分辨率标签的改进方向。

Abstract: We propose a simple, data-efficient pipeline that augments an implicit
reconstruction network based on neural SDF-based CAD parts with a
part-segmentation head trained under PartField-generated supervision. Unlike
methods tied to fixed taxonomies, our model accepts meshes with any number of
parts and produces coherent, geometry-aligned labels in a single pass. We
evaluate on randomly sampled CAD meshes from the ABC dataset with intentionally
varied part cardinalities, including over-segmented shapes, and report strong
performance across reconstruction (CDL1/CDL2, F1-micro, NC) and segmentation
(mIoU, Accuracy), together with a new Segmentation Consistency metric that
captures local label smoothness. We attach a lightweight segmentation head to
the Flat-CAD SDF trunk; on a paired evaluation it does not alter reconstruction
while providing accurate part labels for meshes with any number of parts. Even
under degraded reconstructions on thin or intricate geometries, segmentation
remains accurate and label-coherent, often preserving the correct part count.
Our approach therefore offers a practical route to semantically structured CAD
meshes without requiring curated taxonomies or exact palette matches. We
discuss limitations in boundary precision, partly due to per-face supervision,
and outline paths toward boundary-aware training and higher resolution labels.

Motivation: 利用人眼对高频信息的时空敏感性随外周偏心度增加而下降的特性，以及眼动（扫视和微扫视）导致注视点分布的特性，通过时间复用像素样本来减少每帧需要渲染的中央凹区域大小。

Method: 将帧间像素的时间呈现视为数据流，采用加权水库采样技术高效维护先前帧中感知相关的高质量像素样本水库，并将其整合到当前帧的计算中。

Result: 该方法在4K分辨率下运行时间小于1毫秒，能够显著减小每帧需要渲染的中央凹区域，同时保持更高的感知图像质量，支持更高程度的中央凹渲染。

Conclusion: 提出的加权水库采样方法高效且可集成到实时VR和AR中央凹渲染系统中，通过时间复用像素样本实现了渲染效率与感知质量的平衡。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal sensitivity to high frequency information declines with
increased peripheral eccentricity. Foveated rendering exploits this by
decreasing the spatial resolution of rendered images in peripheral vision,
reducing the rendering cost by omitting high frequency details. As foveation
levels increase, the rendering quality is reduced, and traditional foveated
rendering systems tend not to preserve samples that were previously rendered at
high spatial resolution in previous frames. Additionally, prior research has
shown that saccade landing positions are distributed around a target location
rather than landing at a single point, and that even during fixations, eyes
perform small microsaccades around a fixation point. This creates an
opportunity for sampling from temporally neighbouring frames with differing
foveal locations to reduce the required rendered size of the foveal region
while achieving a higher perceived image quality. We further observe that the
temporal presentation of pixels frame-to-frame can be viewed as a data stream,
presenting a random sampling problem. Following this intuition, we propose a
Weighted Reservoir Sampling technique to efficiently maintain a reservoir of
the perceptually relevant high quality pixel samples from previous frames and
incorporate them into the computation of the current frame. This allows the
renderer to render a smaller region of foveal pixels per frame by temporally
reusing pixel samples that are still relevant to reconstruct a higher perceived
image quality, while allowing for higher levels of foveation. Our method
operates on the output of foveated rendering, and runs in under 1\,ms at 4K
resolution, making it highly efficient and integrable with real-time VR and AR
foveated rendering systems.

Motivation: 解决传统3D内容创作需要专业技能和复杂操作的问题，让普通用户也能通过自然语言轻松生成3D图形内容。

Result: 开发了一个完整的3D-CG生成框架，支持自然语言输入、自动化工具操作、用户反馈学习和本地模型部署。

Conclusion: 3Dify成功实现了通过自然语言生成3D内容的目标，降低了3D创作门槛，提供了灵活且成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes "3Dify," a procedural 3D computer graphics (3D-CG)
generation framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework
enables users to generate 3D-CG content solely through natural language
instructions. 3Dify is built upon Dify, an open-source platform for AI
application development, and incorporates several state-of-the-art LLM-related
technologies such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation
of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not
support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent
(CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover,
to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by
selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns
variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent
generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed
LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time
and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own
computational resources.

Motivation: 现有基于2D提升的3D编辑方法存在不一致性问题，主要源于缺乏视图一致的2D编辑模型和难以确保多视图编辑一致性。

Method: 方法包括：1）选择GT视图和对应编辑图像作为优化目标；2）在GT视图和多视图中微调2D编辑模型以对齐GT编辑图像；3）引入独立LoRA模块分别处理GT视图拟合和多视图一致性需求。

Result: 该方法在定性和定量评估中均优于现有2D提升式方法，提供更一致和可控的2D和3D编辑结果。

Conclusion: C3Editor通过视图一致的2D编辑模型和针对性微调策略，有效解决了3D编辑中的一致性问题，实现了高质量的3D编辑效果。

Abstract: Existing 2D-lifting-based 3D editing methods often encounter challenges
related to inconsistency, stemming from the lack of view-consistent 2D editing
models and the difficulty of ensuring consistent editing across multiple views.
To address these issues, we propose C3Editor, a controllable and consistent
2D-lifting-based 3D editing framework. Given an original 3D representation and
a text-based editing prompt, our method selectively establishes a
view-consistent 2D editing model to achieve superior 3D editing results. The
process begins with the controlled selection of a ground truth (GT) view and
its corresponding edited image as the optimization target, allowing for
user-defined manual edits. Next, we fine-tune the 2D editing model within the
GT view and across multiple views to align with the GT-edited image while
ensuring multi-view consistency. To meet the distinct requirements of GT view
fitting and multi-view consistency, we introduce separate LoRA modules for
targeted fine-tuning. Our approach delivers more consistent and controllable 2D
and 3D editing results than existing 2D-lifting-based methods, outperforming
them in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Method: 开发了LLM驱动的智能体系统来指导对话流程和确定互动行为，并提出基于自回归扩散模型的双人姿态生成模型，从语音信号合成协调运动。

Result: 用户研究和定量评估表明，该模型显著提高了双人互动的质量，产生了自然、同步的非语言行为。

Conclusion: Social Agent框架通过结合智能体系统和扩散模型，成功实现了逼真的双人对话非语言行为合成，为动态交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Social Agent, a novel framework for synthesizing realistic and
contextually appropriate co-speech nonverbal behaviors in dyadic conversations.
In this framework, we develop an agentic system driven by a Large Language
Model (LLM) to direct the conversation flow and determine appropriate
interactive behaviors for both participants. Additionally, we propose a novel
dual-person gesture generation model based on an auto-regressive diffusion
model, which synthesizes coordinated motions from speech signals. The output of
the agentic system is translated into high-level guidance for the gesture
generator, resulting in realistic movement at both the behavioral and motion
levels. Furthermore, the agentic system periodically examines the movements of
interlocutors and infers their intentions, forming a continuous feedback loop
that enables dynamic and responsive interactions between the two participants.
User studies and quantitative evaluations show that our model significantly
improves the quality of dyadic interactions, producing natural, synchronized
nonverbal behaviors.

Method: 采用系统综述方法，追溯从GAN、VAE到扩散-Transformer混合架构的演变，详细分析模型工作原理、训练数据集、硬件配置、超参数设置和评估指标。

Result: 展示了不同架构模型在标准基准测试中的性能表现，同时指出了当前评估指标的局限性，并讨论了向更全面、感知对齐评估策略的转变趋势。

Conclusion: 文本到视频生成技术已取得显著进展，但仍面临诸多挑战。本文为未来研究者提供了发展视角，指出了值得探索的研究方向，以推动T2V研究和应用的进一步发展。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation technology holds potential to transform
multiple domains such as education, marketing, entertainment, and assistive
technologies for individuals with visual or reading comprehension challenges,
by creating coherent visual content from natural language prompts. From its
inception, the field has advanced from adversarial models to diffusion-based
models, yielding higher-fidelity, temporally consistent outputs. Yet challenges
persist, such as alignment, long-range coherence, and computational efficiency.
Addressing this evolving landscape, we present a comprehensive survey of
text-to-video generative models, tracing their development from early GANs and
VAEs to hybrid Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) architectures, detailing how these
models work, what limitations they addressed in their predecessors, and why
shifts toward new architectural paradigms were necessary to overcome challenges
in quality, coherence, and control. We provide a systematic account of the
datasets, which the surveyed text-to-video models were trained and evaluated
on, and, to support reproducibility and assess the accessibility of training
such models, we detail their training configurations, including their hardware
specifications, GPU counts, batch sizes, learning rates, optimizers, epochs,
and other key hyperparameters. Further, we outline the evaluation metrics
commonly used for evaluating such models and present their performance across
standard benchmarks, while also discussing the limitations of these metrics and
the emerging shift toward more holistic, perception-aligned evaluation
strategies. Finally, drawing from our analysis, we outline the current open
challenges and propose a few promising future directions, laying out a
perspective for future researchers to explore and build upon in advancing T2V
research and applications.

*Ronen Kamenetsky,Sara Dorfman,Daniel Garibi,Roni Paiss,Or Patashnik,Daniel Cohen-Or*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出一种通过文本嵌入的token级操作实现解耦和连续编辑的方法，使用稀疏自编码器识别语义隔离的编辑方向，无需修改扩散过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型仅通过文本提示无法提供足够的编辑控制，特别是缺乏解耦性（改变一个属性不影响其他属性）和连续性（平滑调整编辑强度）控制。

Method: 通过操作文本嵌入沿特定方向实现编辑，使用稀疏自编码器识别控制目标属性的语义隔离维度，该方法与扩散模型无关。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够在不同属性和领域中实现直观高效的连续控制编辑。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种模型无关的文本嵌入编辑方案，实现了对图像编辑过程的解耦和连续控制。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have become the backbone of modern
image editing, yet text prompts alone do not offer adequate control over the
editing process. Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement,
where changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and
continuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We
introduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level
manipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the
embeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the
target attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our
method operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion
process, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image
synthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient
manipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个联合生成人类动作和相机轨迹的框架，通过屏幕空间框架作为辅助模态来确保多模态一致性，在保持屏幕构图一致性的同时生成两种异构但内在关联的模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将人类动作和相机轨迹生成分开处理，忽视了电影摄影中演员表演与摄像机工作的紧密互动关系。本文旨在实现文本条件下的联合生成，保持一致的屏幕构图。

Method: 提出一个模型无关的框架，通过将人体关节点投影到相机上产生的屏幕框架作为辅助模态来增强多模态一致性。设计联合自编码器学习共享潜在空间，并引入辅助采样利用线性变换引导生成过程。

Result: 在DiT和MAR架构上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效生成屏幕框架一致的人机运动，同时在两种模态的文本对齐方面也取得提升。定性结果显示出更具电影摄影意义的构图。

Conclusion: 该方法通过屏幕框架作为桥梁，成功实现了人类动作和相机轨迹的协调生成，为该任务设立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: Treating human motion and camera trajectory generation separately overlooks a
core principle of cinematography: the tight interplay between actor performance
and camera work in the screen space. In this paper, we are the first to cast
this task as a text-conditioned joint generation, aiming to maintain consistent
on-screen framing while producing two heterogeneous, yet intrinsically linked,
modalities: human motion and camera trajectories. We propose a simple,
model-agnostic framework that enforces multimodal coherence via an auxiliary
modality: the on-screen framing induced by projecting human joints onto the
camera. This on-screen framing provides a natural and effective bridge between
modalities, promoting consistency and leading to more precise joint
distribution. We first design a joint autoencoder that learns a shared latent
space, together with a lightweight linear transform from the human and camera
latents to a framing latent. We then introduce auxiliary sampling, which
exploits this linear transform to steer generation toward a coherent framing
modality. To support this task, we also introduce the PulpMotion dataset, a
human-motion and camera-trajectory dataset with rich captions, and high-quality
human motions. Extensive experiments across DiT- and MAR-based architectures
show the generality and effectiveness of our method in generating on-frame
coherent human-camera motions, while also achieving gains on textual alignment
for both modalities. Our qualitative results yield more cinematographically
meaningful framings setting the new state of the art for this task. Code,
models and data are available in our

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 开发了一种混合现实模拟器，通过虚拟CT室导览、放松训练和真实扫描模拟来降低首次CT扫描患者的焦虑，提高配合度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 首次接受CT扫描的患者通常经历显著的焦虑和不确定性，这会影响扫描结果和患者福祉。现有方法如教育材料和虚拟现实暴露疗法存在局限性。

Method: 设计并实现混合现实模拟器，包含虚拟CT室导览、引导放松训练、真实扫描模拟（视听提示和屏息练习）以及交互反馈。

Result: 试点研究（n=50）显示，使用模拟器的患者相比对照组，扫描前焦虑水平显著降低，实际CT过程中的配合度提高。患者反馈积极，满意度高。

Conclusion: 混合现实模拟器能有效降低患者焦虑并提高配合度，具有临床价值，但需解决集成挑战，未来可进一步改进以提升以患者为中心的护理。

Abstract: First-time patients undergoing diagnostic computed tomography (CT) scans
often experience significant anxiety and uncertainty, which can negatively
impact scan results and patient well-being. We present an immersive mixed
reality (MR) simulator designed to prepare adult patients for their first CT
scan, aiming to improve both emotional and physical preparedness. In this
paper, we review existing methods for reducing scan-related anxiety -- from
educational materials to virtual reality exposure -- and identify their
limitations. We then detail the design and technical implementation of our MR
simulator, which combines a virtual CT suite walkthrough, guided relaxation
training, realistic scan simulation (including audiovisual cues and breath-hold
practice), and interactive feedback. The inclusion of these features is
grounded in evidence-based rationale drawn from prior studies in patient
anxiety reduction and compliance. We report results from a pilot study ($n=50$)
demonstrating that patients who used the simulator had significantly lower
pre-scan anxiety levels and improved compliance during the actual CT procedure,
compared to controls. Patient feedback was overwhelmingly positive, indicating
high satisfaction and perceived utility. We discuss the clinical implications
of deploying such a tool, challenges in integration, and future directions for
improving patient-centered care using mixed reality technologies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Magic Leap头戴显示器的混合现实手术导航系统，用于在肝脏手术中辅助外科医生进行精确的解剖刀操作，通过在3D打印的肝脏模型上投影全息指引来提高手术精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强和混合现实系统有潜力通过在手术区域直接叠加数字指引来提高手术精度，特别是在需要精确切除的肝脏手术中。

Method: 系统使用Magic Leap头戴显示器，在患者特定的3D打印肝脏模型上投影全息指引，包括术前建模、虚拟内容配准到模型以及通过Magic Leap设备进行实时可视化。

Result: 在模型研究中，混合现实引导使切割精度提高了60%（平均偏差从5.0mm降至2.0mm），效率提高了40%（平均任务时间从55秒降至32秒），参与者报告深度感知和定位肿瘤边界的信心得到增强。

Conclusion: 基于Magic Leap的混合现实引导可以显著增强外科医生在精细切除任务中的表现，为更安全、更精确的肝脏手术铺平道路，但仍需解决配准精度、视线和人体工程学等技术挑战。

Abstract: Augmented and mixed reality (MR) systems have the potential to improve
surgical precision by overlaying digital guidance directly onto the operative
field. This paper presents a novel MR guidance system using the Magic Leap
head-mounted display to assist surgeons in executing precise scalpel movements
during liver surgery. The system projects holographic cues onto a
patient-specific 3D-printed liver phantom, guiding resection along a
predetermined path. We describe the system design, including preoperative
modeling, registration of virtual content to the phantom, and real-time
visualization through the Magic Leap device. In a controlled phantom study,
surgical trainees performed resection tasks with and without MR guidance.
Quantitative results demonstrated that MR guidance improved cutting accuracy
(mean deviation from planned path was reduced from 5.0 mm without AR to 2.0 mm
with AR guidance) and efficiency (mean task time decreased from 55 s to 32 s).
These improvements of approximately 60% in accuracy and 40% in speed underscore
the potential benefit of MR in surgical navigation. Participants reported that
the Magic Leap visualization enhanced depth perception and confidence in
locating tumor boundaries. This work provides a comprehensive evaluation of an
MR-assisted surgical guidance approach, highlighting its feasibility on a
realistic organ phantom. We discuss the technical challenges (registration
accuracy, line-of-sight, user ergonomics) and outline future steps toward
clinical translation. The results suggest that Magic Leap-based MR guidance can
significantly augment a surgeon's performance in delicate resection tasks,
paving the way for safer and more precise liver surgery.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM的谄媚行为会损害用户的问题解决能力，用户更容易维持错误观念并过度依赖无用的AI回复，但多数人无法察觉这种谄媚行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化LLM谄媚行为对人类与AI协作中复杂问题解决任务的影响，特别是对容易产生误解的新手用户的影响。

Method: 创建高谄媚和低谄媚两种LLM聊天机器人，在调试机器学习模型的背景下进行受试者内实验(n=24)，分析谄媚行为对用户心智模型、工作流程、依赖行为和感知的影响。

Result: 使用高谄媚聊天机器人的用户更不可能纠正误解，花费更多时间过度依赖无用的LLM回复。尽管结果受损，大多数用户无法检测到过度的谄媚行为。

Conclusion: LLM的谄媚行为对人类-AI协作有负面影响，会阻碍用户学习和发展正确的心智模型，且用户对此缺乏意识，这构成了显著的风险。

Abstract: Sycophancy, the tendency of LLM-based chatbots to express excessive
enthusiasm, agreement, flattery, and a lack of disagreement, is emerging as a
significant risk in human-AI interactions. However, the extent to which this
affects human-LLM collaboration in complex problem-solving tasks is not well
quantified, especially among novices who are prone to misconceptions. We
created two LLM chatbots, one with high sycophancy and one with low sycophancy,
and conducted a within-subjects experiment (n=24) in the context of debugging
machine learning models to isolate the effect of LLM sycophancy on users'
mental models, their workflows, reliance behaviors, and their perceptions of
the chatbots. Our findings show that users of the high sycophancy chatbot were
less likely to correct their misconceptions and spent more time over-relying on
unhelpful LLM responses. Despite these impaired outcomes, a majority of users
were unable to detect the presence of excessive sycophancy.

TL;DR: 该研究针对自闭症谱系障碍(ASD)儿童在混合现实舞蹈治疗中的模仿缺陷，开发了一种双层次视觉引导系统，旨在增强注视-表现之间的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASD儿童存在视觉运动整合障碍导致动作模仿困难，而现有的注视引导干预主要关注优化注视本身，忽视了关键的"注视-表现联系"。

Method: 首先通过实验确认了注视-表现联系的薄弱性，然后提出并验证了一种在感知和转换层次上运作的双层次视觉引导系统，不仅引导注意力到任务相关区域，还明确支持从注视感知到表现执行的转换。

Result: 研究结果证明了该系统在增强注视-表现联系方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项研究为更精确定制和有效的ASD混合现实舞蹈治疗干预奠定了关键基础。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is marked by action imitation deficits
stemming from visuomotor integration impairments, posing challenges to
imitation-based learning, such as dance movement therapy in mixed reality
(MR-DMT). Previous gaze-guiding interventions in ASD have mainly focused on
optimizing gaze in isolation, neglecting the crucial "gaze-performance link".
This study investigates enhancing this link in MR-DMT for children with ASD.
Initially, we experimentally confirmed the weak link: longer gaze durations
didn't translate to better performance. Then, we proposed and validated a novel
dual-level visual guidance system that operates on both perceptual and
transformational levels: not only directing attention to task-relevant areas
but also explicitly scaffolding the translation from gaze perception to
performance execution. Our results demonstrate its effectiveness in boosting
the gaze-performance link, laying key foundations for more precisely tailored
and effective MR-DMT interventions for ASD.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI代理在编程教育中的整合方式及其对学生学习成果的影响，为教育实践提供证据基础。

Method: 分析了2012-2025年间发表的58篇同行评审研究，识别了三种主要AI代理类型及其教学目标和效果。

Result: 94.83%的研究报告了增强编程支持，18.96%报告了动机和情感益处，6.90%报告了教师效率提升。同时93.10%的研究记录了设置障碍，65.52%记录了过度依赖问题。

Conclusion: 需要建立教学框架，优先发展提示工程技能和人工监督，以解决AI集成中的挑战，为编程教育提供实用和伦理指导。

Abstract: This review examines the role of artificial intelligence (AI) agents in
programming education, focusing on how these tools are being integrated into
educational practice and their impact on student learning outcomes. An analysis
of fifty-eight peer-reviewed studies published between 2022 and 2025 identified
three primary categories of AI agents: chatbots, generative AI (GenAI), and
intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), with GenAI being the most frequently
studied. The primary instructional objectives reported include enhanced
programming support in 94.83% of studies, motivational and emotional benefits
in 18.96%, and increased efficiency for educators in 6.90%. Reported benefits
include personalized feedback, improved learning outcomes, and time savings.
The review also highlights challenges, such as setup barriers documented in
93.10% of studies, overreliance resulting in superficial learning in 65.52%,
and concerns regarding AI errors and academic integrity. These findings suggest
the need for instructional frameworks that prioritize the development of prompt
engineering skills and human oversight to address these issues. This review
provides educators and curriculum designers with an evidence-based foundation
for the practical and ethical integration of AI in programming education.

Abstract: Collaborative group projects are integral to computer science education, as
they foster teamwork, problem-solving skills, and industry-relevant
competencies. However, assessing individual contributions within group settings
has long been a challenge. Traditional assessment strategies, such as the equal
distribution of grades or subjective peer assessments, often fall short in
terms of fairness, objectivity, and scalability, particularly in large
classrooms. This paper introduces a semi-automated, AI-assisted grading system
that evaluates both project quality and individual effort using repository
mining, communication analytics, and machine learning models. The system
comprises modules for project evaluation, contribution analysis, and grade
computation, integrating seamlessly with platforms like GitHub. A pilot
deployment in a senior-level course demonstrated high alignment with instructor
assessments, increased student satisfaction, and reduced instructor grading
effort. We conclude by discussing implementation considerations, ethical
implications, and proposed enhancements to broaden applicability.

Motivation: 当前基于视觉和可穿戴设备的手部姿态追踪方法在便携性、可用性和实用性方面存在限制，需要开发更紧凑实用的解决方案。

Method: 使用戒指上的IMU传感器捕捉手指运动，手腕上的单通道EMG传感器检测肌肉活动，开发双分支transformer网络融合IMU和EMG数据，通过跨模态注意力同时预测手指关节位置和力。

Result: 在20名参与者进行日常物体交互手势的评估中，平均MPJPE为0.57厘米，指尖力估计RMSE为0.213，相关系数r=0.76。

Conclusion: 这种最小化、力感知的追踪系统对VR/AR、辅助假肢和人体工程学监测具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Hand pose tracking is essential for advancing applications in human-computer
interaction. Current approaches, such as vision-based systems and wearable
devices, face limitations in portability, usability, and practicality. We
present a novel wearable system that reconstructs 3D hand pose and estimates
per-finger forces using a minimal ring-watch sensor setup. A ring worn on the
finger integrates an inertial measurement unit (IMU) to capture finger motion,
while a smartwatch-based single-channel electromyography (EMG) sensor on the
wrist detects muscle activations. By leveraging the complementary strengths of
motion sensing and muscle signals, our approach achieves accurate hand pose
tracking and grip force estimation in a compact wearable form factor. We
develop a dual-branch transformer network that fuses IMU and EMG data with
cross-modal attention to predict finger joint positions and forces
simultaneously. A custom loss function imposes kinematic constraints for smooth
force variation and realistic force saturation. Evaluation with 20 participants
performing daily object interaction gestures demonstrates an average Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE) of 0.57 cm and a fingertip force estimation (RMSE:
0.213, r=0.76). We showcase our system in a real-time Unity application,
enabling virtual hand interactions that respond to user-applied forces. This
minimal, force-aware tracking system has broad implications for VR/AR,
assistive prosthetics, and ergonomic monitoring.

Motivation: 同向偏盲患者报告在避免与其他行人碰撞方面存在困难，但临床测量方法无法捕捉这些碰撞避免困难。

Method: 使用Meta Quest 2和Unity开发虚拟现实环境，让受试者在真实走廊中自然行走，同时通过头戴显示器观看沉浸式VR购物中心环境，测量与虚拟行人的碰撞检测和避免行为。

Result: 同向偏盲患者比正常视力受试者更不容易检测到行人碰撞，更容易发生碰撞，特别是在盲侧目标上。患者还会偏向盲侧旋转头部，并在检测后更频繁地旋转。

Conclusion: 这种VR碰撞检测和避免评估系统能够捕捉临床测量无法记录的碰撞避免困难，为临床医生提供了一种经济实惠的客观评估工具，可用于移动能力增强和康复训练。

Abstract: Homonymous hemianopia (HH) patients report difficulties in avoiding
collisions with other pedestrians. We evaluated pedestrian collision detection
and avoidance behaviors in HH patients and healthy controls using a novel
virtual reality (VR) walking with pedestrians, which enables natural walking
behavior in an empty real-world corridor while viewing an immersive VR
environment (shopping mall with colliding and other pedestrians) presented in a
head-mounted display (HMD). Critically, it measures avoidance maneuvers in
addition to collision detection. Colliding and non-colliding pedestrian
scenarios were developed for Meta Quest 2 using Unity. Ten normal vision (NV)
subjects and 12 HH subjects detected and avoided collisions with virtual
approaching and overtaken pedestrians initialized at bearing angles of 20, 40,
and 60 degrees, with planned time-to-collision of 6 seconds in each trial. HH
subjects were less likely to detect and more likely to collide with pedestrians
than NV, particularly for blind-side targets. Response times did not differ
between groups but were faster for overtaken pedestrians. HH subjects also
biased their head rotations toward the blind side and more after detection
compared to before. Collision avoidance difficulties as reported by HH
subjects, which clinical measures fail to capture, were recorded and analyzed
with objective measures. These metrics may offer further insights into the
underlying mechanisms driving collision avoidance behaviors. Our HMD-VR
collision detection and avoidance paradigm enables natural walking behaviors
and offers an affordable, objective assessment tool that may be adopted by
clinicians for mobility enhancement and rehabilitation.

TL;DR: 研究验证了AI代理在说服性对话中能够产生从众效应，当AI代理被说服时，人类参与者的感知说服力和态度改变显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证AI代理是否能够产生从众效应，即个体是否会在AI代理被说服时也倾向于被说服。

Method: 通过文本对话实验，比较四种条件：AI代理是否接受说服以及是否有破冰环节，观察人类参与者的态度变化。

Result: 当AI代理接受说服时，感知说服力和实际态度改变显著改善；态度改变在同时使用破冰环节时最大；未被说服的AI代理会抑制态度改变。

Conclusion: 适当设计被说服AI代理可以通过从众效应提高说服效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in AI have highlighted its application in captology, the
field of using computers as persuasive technologies. We hypothesized that the
"conformity effect," where individuals align with others' actions, also occurs
with AI agents. This study verifies this hypothesis by introducing a "Persuadee
Agent" that is persuaded alongside a human participant in a three-party
persuasive dialogue with a Persuader Agent. We conducted a text-based dialogue
experiment with human participants. We compared four conditions manipulating
the Persuadee Agent's behavior (persuasion acceptance vs. non-acceptance) and
the presence of an icebreaker session. Results showed that when the Persuadee
Agent accepted persuasion, both perceived persuasiveness and actual attitude
change significantly improved. Attitude change was greatest when an icebreaker
was also used, whereas an unpersuaded AI agent suppressed attitude change.
Additionally, it was confirmed that the persuasion acceptance of participants
increased at the moment the Persuadee Agent was persuaded. These results
suggest that appropriately designing a Persuadee Agent can improve persuasion
through the conformity effect.

Motivation: 当前LLM在决策支持中倾向于提供解决方案，限制了用户的元认知意识。研究旨在将关注点从解决方案导向转向反思活动，促进预决策反思。

Method: 引入PROBE框架，从广度（思维类别多样性）和深度（推理详尽程度）两个维度评估预决策反思，并通过编码者一致性验证其可靠性。

Result: 研究发现参与者之间存在显著异质性，人们认为自己的无辅助反思比PROBE测量的更深更广。PROBE能够揭示隐藏的思维模式。

Conclusion: PROBE通过揭示隐藏的思维模式，为开发促进自我意识和增强人们在决策中选择依赖思维模式的能力的技术开辟了机会。

Abstract: When making significant life decisions, people increasingly turn to
conversational AI tools, such as large language models (LLMs). However, LLMs
often steer users toward solutions, limiting metacognitive awareness of their
own decision-making. In this paper, we shift the focus in decision support from
solution-orientation to reflective activity, coining the term pre-decision
reflection (PDR). We introduce PROBE, the first framework that assesses
pre-decision reflections along two dimensions: breadth (diversity of thought
categories) and depth (elaborateness of reasoning). Coder agreement
demonstrates PROBE's reliability in capturing how people engage in pre-decision
reflection. Our study reveals substantial heterogeneity across participants and
shows that people perceived their unassisted reflections as deeper and broader

### [432] [Beyond the Benefits: A Systematic Review of the Harms and Consequences of Generative AI in Computing Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04443)
*Seth Bernstein,Ashfin Rahman,Nadia Sharifi,Ariunjargal Terbish,Stephen MacNeil*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文通过系统文献综述分析了生成式AI在计算机教育中的风险、危害和意外后果，涵盖2022-2025年的224篇论文，识别了学术诚信、认知影响和信任问题等危害类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在计算机教育中已带来诸多益处，但近期研究也发现了潜在风险和危害。为了在最大化AI益处的同时解决这些危害和意外后果，需要进行系统性的文献综述。

Method: 对ACM DL、IEEE Xplore和Scopus数据库（2022-2025年）进行系统文献检索，筛选出224篇符合纳入标准的论文。四位评审独立提取出版年份、学习者群体、研究方法等信息，并对每篇论文进行危害类别编码。

Result: 分析揭示了危害出现的模式和地点，突出了方法学上的差距和更严格证据的机会，识别了未被充分探索的危害和学生群体。

Conclusion: 通过综合这些见解，旨在为教育工作者、计算机学生、研究人员和开发者提供关于生成式AI在计算机教育中相关危害的清晰图景。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has already had a big impact on
computing education with prior research identifying many benefits. However,
recent studies have also identified potential risks and harms. To continue
maximizing AI benefits while addressing the harms and unintended consequences,
we conducted a systematic literature review of research focusing on the risks,
harms, and unintended consequences of GenAI in computing education. Our search
of ACM DL, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus (2022-2025) resulted in 1,677 papers, which
were then filtered to 224 based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Guided
by best practices for systematic reviews, four reviewers independently
extracted publication year, learner population, research method, contribution
type, GenAI technology, and educational task information from each paper. We
then coded each paper for concrete harm categories such as academic integrity,
cognitive effects, and trust issues. Our analysis shows patterns in how and
where harms appear, highlights methodological gaps and opportunities for more
rigorous evidence, and identifies under-explored harms and student populations.
By synthesizing these insights, we intend to equip educators, computing
students, researchers, and developers with a clear picture of the harms
associated with GenAI in computing education.

*Jenny T. Liang,Titus Barik,Jeffrey Nichols,Eldon Schoop,Ruijia Cheng*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文通过用户研究探索了AI代理体验原型设计系统的需求，开发了AgentBuilder设计探针，并验证了原型设计需求和开发者需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI代理的发展，需要让更多非AI工程师参与代理体验原型设计，以贡献多样化视角。

Method: 进行需求收集研究（12名参与者），识别代理体验原型设计的关键活动和系统能力需求，开发AgentBuilder设计探针，并进行实地原型设计研究（14名参与者）。

Result: 识别了代理体验原型设计的关键活动、系统能力需求，并通过AgentBuilder验证了设计需求，获得了开发者原型设计过程和需求的见解。

Conclusion: 研究为代理体验原型设计系统提供了设计指导，支持更广泛人群参与AI代理体验设计。

Abstract: Interface agents powered by generative AI models (referred to as "agents")
can automate actions based on user commands. An important aspect of developing
agents is their user experience (i.e., agent experience). There is a growing
need to provide scaffolds for a broader set of individuals beyond AI engineers
to prototype agent experiences, since they can contribute valuable perspectives
to designing agent experiences. In this work, we explore the affordances agent
prototyping systems should offer by conducting a requirements elicitation study
with 12 participants with varying experience with agents. We identify key
activities in agent experience prototyping and the desired capabilities of
agent prototyping systems. We instantiate those capabilities in the
AgentBuilder design probe for agent prototyping. We conduct an in situ agent
prototyping study with 14 participants using AgentBuilder to validate the
design requirements and elicit insights on how developers prototype agents and
what their needs are in this process.

### [434] [Autonomy Matters: A Study on Personalization-Privacy Dilemma in LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04465)
*Zhiping Zhang,Yi Evie Zhang,Freda Shi,Tianshi Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究LLM代理的自主性水平和个人化如何影响用户的隐私担忧、信任和使用意愿，发现中等自主性可以缓解个人化带来的隐私困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理需要个人信息来实现个性化服务，但这引发了隐私担忧，形成了个性化与隐私的困境。代理的自主性既带来风险也创造机会，但其具体影响尚不明确。

Method: 采用3×3被试间实验设计（N=450），研究代理自主性水平（无、中等、完全）和个人化对用户隐私担忧、信任和使用意愿的影响，并分析心理机制。

Result: 不考虑用户隐私偏好的个性化会增加隐私担忧，降低信任和使用意愿。自主性调节这些效应：中等自主性条件下，个性化的影响比无自主性和完全自主性条件下更平缓。

Conclusion: 与其追求完美的模型对齐，平衡代理行动自主性和用户控制是缓解个性化-隐私困境的有前景路径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents require personal information for
personalization in order to better act on users' behalf in daily tasks, but
this raises privacy concerns and a personalization-privacy dilemma. Agent's
autonomy introduces both risks and opportunities, yet its effects remain
unclear. To better understand this, we conducted a 3$\times$3 between-subjects
experiment ($N=450$) to study how agent's autonomy level and personalization
influence users' privacy concerns, trust and willingness to use, as well as the
underlying psychological processes. We find that personalization without
considering users' privacy preferences increases privacy concerns and decreases
trust and willingness to use. Autonomy moderates these effects: Intermediate
autonomy flattens the impact of personalization compared to No- and Full
autonomy conditions. Our results suggest that rather than aiming for perfect
model alignment in output generation, balancing autonomy of agent's action and
user control offers a promising path to mitigate the personalization-privacy
dilemma.

*Jinyan Su,Claire Cardie,Jennifer Healey*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 人类在多跳问答任务中知识整合能力出色（97%准确率），但经常无法识别何时需要多跳推理（67%准确率），且容易犯语义错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了理解人类如何与AI有效协作，评估人类在多跳问答各推理子任务上的表现。

Method: 通过众包工作者在多跳问答任务中的表现，分析人类在识别多跳推理需求、阅读理解、逻辑推理和知识整合等子任务上的准确率。

Result: 人类知识整合能力很强（97%），但多跳推理识别能力较弱（67%）；单跳和多跳QA表现尚可（84%和80%），但经常犯语义错误。

Conclusion: 设计AI系统时应互补人类优势，同时弥补其常见弱点。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering is a challenging task for both large language
models (LLMs) and humans, as it requires recognizing when multi-hop reasoning
is needed, followed by reading comprehension, logical reasoning, and knowledge
integration. To better understand how humans might collaborate effectively with
AI, we evaluate the performance of crowd workers on these individual reasoning
subtasks. We find that while humans excel at knowledge integration (97\%
accuracy), they often fail to recognize when a question requires multi-hop
reasoning (67\% accuracy). Participants perform reasonably well on both
single-hop and multi-hop QA (84\% and 80\% accuracy, respectively), but
frequently make semantic mistakes--for example, answering "when" an event
happened when the question asked "where." These findings highlight the
importance of designing AI systems that complement human strengths while
compensating for common weaknesses.

### [436] [NaturalEdit: Code Modification through Direct Interaction with Adaptive Natural Language Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04494)
*Ningzhi Tang,David Meininger,Gelei Xu,Yiyu Shi,Yu Huang,Collin McMillan,Toby Jia-Jun Li*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: NaturalEdit是一个将代码摘要转化为交互式自适应表示的系统，通过自然语言界面支持代码修改的完整工作流程，提高开发者的理解、意图表达和验证能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码修改是一个认知要求很高的过程，需要理解代码、规划变更、表达意图和验证结果。现有的自然语言代码摘要虽然有助于理解，但仍然是静态的，无法支持完整的工作流程。

Method: 基于认知维度框架，NaturalEdit实现了三个关键特性：(1) 具有灵活抽象梯度的自适应多面代码摘要表示；(2) 摘要与代码之间的交互映射机制，确保紧密映射；(3) 意图驱动的双向同步，减少编辑和验证的粘性。

Result: 技术评估确认了NaturalEdit的性能，对12名开发者的用户研究表明，该系统增强了理解、意图表达和验证能力，使开发者获得更大的信心和控制感。

Conclusion: NaturalEdit通过将代码摘要转化为交互式自适应表示，成功支持了代码修改的完整认知工作流程，显著提升了开发者的工作效率和信心。

Abstract: Code modification requires developers to comprehend code, plan changes,
articulate intentions, and validate outcomes, making it a cognitively demanding
process. Generated natural language code summaries aid comprehension but remain
static and limited in supporting the full workflow. We present NaturalEdit, a
system that makes code summaries interactive and adaptive representations
directly linked to source code. Grounded in the Cognitive Dimensions of
Notations, NaturalEdit implements a paradigm of code modification through
interaction with natural language representations through three key features:
(1) adaptive multi-faceted representation of code summaries with flexible
Abstraction Gradient; (2) interactive mapping mechanisms between summaries and
codes, ensuring a tight Closeness of Mapping; and (3) intent-driven,
bidirectional synchronization that reduces Viscosity in editing and validation.
A technical evaluation confirms the performance of NaturalEdit, and a user
study with 12 developers shows that it enhances comprehension, intent
articulation, and validation, giving developers greater confidence and control.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文对数据叙事研究领域进行了系统性回顾，通过分析96篇提供明确定义的文献，识别了五种定义范式，揭示了该概念在内容、目标和技巧方面的广泛解释差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据叙事研究的快速发展，其概念边界变得模糊不清。理解学术界如何定义和解释'数据叙事'对于促进研究者间的交流、确保概念和度量的一致性、帮助新研究者定位研究方向以及有效应用相关技术和工具至关重要。

Method: 调查了现有研究如何概念化'数据叙事'，识别出96篇提供明确定义的出版物，通过深入编码这些定义进行分析。

Result: 识别了五种定义数据叙事的范式，揭示了关于数据叙事内容、目标和技巧的广泛解释谱系。

Conclusion: 为未来研究提供了启示，旨在促进关于'数据叙事'的细致交流，提出研究机会，并为这一研究方向建立更具包容性的理论基础。

Abstract: We have witnessed rapid growth in data storytelling research. Scholars from
multiple disciplines have contributed new theories and techniques surrounding
data storytelling. However, with this prolific development, a fuzzy boundary of
data storytelling comes. We argue that understanding how "data storytelling"
has been defined and interpreted by academia is crucial for facilitating
communication between researchers, encouraging the consistent use of concepts
and measures, assisting newcomers in approaching and positioning their research
in this area, and enabling the effective application of relevant techniques and
tools. Thus, it is necessary to systematically reflect on "what is data
storytelling" and promote a more thorough understanding of this concept.
Specifically, we investigated how existing research has conceptualized "data
storytelling." As a result, we identified 96 publications that provide explicit
definitions. By coding these definitions in-depth, we identified five paradigms
of defining data storytelling, as well as a broad spectrum of interpretations
regarding the content, objectives, and techniques of data storytelling.
Finally, we concluded with implications for future research, aiming to foster
nuanced communication about "data storytelling," suggest research
opportunities, and establish a more inclusive theoretical foundation for this
research direction.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了在AI贷款决策系统中整合情境解释以增强信任和可用性，发现纯技术透明度存在局限，需要结合社会和经济背景的情境解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI系统过度依赖算法透明度和技术准确性，但忽视了更广泛的社会经济背景，导致用户信任度和系统可用性不足。

Method: 通过定性研究调查用户与AI解释的交互，识别当前系统在提供情境方面的关键差距。

Result: 研究结果强调了纯技术透明度的局限性，以及需要能够连接算法输出与现实世界决策的情境解释的迫切需求。

Conclusion: 通过使解释与用户需求及更广泛的社会因素保持一致，系统旨在培养信任、改进决策，并推进以人为本的AI系统设计。

Abstract: This study explores the integration of contextual explanations into
AI-powered loan decision systems to enhance trust and usability. While
traditional AI systems rely heavily on algorithmic transparency and technical
accuracy, they often fail to account for broader social and economic contexts.
Through a qualitative study, I investigated user interactions with AI
explanations and identified key gaps, in- cluding the inability of current
systems to provide context. My findings underscore the limitations of purely
technical transparency and the critical need for contex- tual explanations that
bridge the gap between algorithmic outputs and real-world decision-making. By
aligning explanations with user needs and broader societal factors, the system
aims to foster trust, improve decision-making, and advance the design of
human-centered AI systems

TL;DR: 提出了一个交互式可视化系统，用于探索文档集合中的命名实体及其关系，采用基于图的表示方法，支持多视图协调、模糊视图和交互式图编辑功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为支持人类对实体丰富的文本数据进行探索性分析，需要结合图可视化、交互式细化和关系适应性视角的方法。

Method: 构建包含文档、实体提及和实体三类节点的图结构，捕捉跨上下文相同实体和文档内共现两种关键关系，提供多视图协调、模糊视图和交互式图编辑功能。

Result: 开发了一个支持灵活迭代探索的系统，用户能够检查实体出现情况、发现相关提及簇、探索高层实体群关系，并支持过滤、导航和导出功能。

Conclusion: 该系统通过结合图可视化、交互式细化和关系适应性视角，为人本中心的实体丰富文本数据探索做出了贡献。

Abstract: We present an interactive visualization system for exploring named entities
and their relationships across document collections. The system is designed
around a graph-based representation that integrates three types of nodes:
documents, entity mentions, and entities. Connections capture two key
relationship types: (i) identical entities across contexts, and (ii)
co-locations of mentions within documents. Multiple coordinated views enable
users to examine entity occurrences, discover clusters of related mentions, and
explore higher-level entity group relationships. To support flexible and
iterative exploration, the interface offers fuzzy views with approximate
connections, as well as tools for interactively editing the graph by adding or
removing links, entities, and mentions, as well as editing entity terms.
Additional interaction features include filtering, mini-map navigation, and
export options to JSON or image formats for downstream analysis and reporting.
This approach contributes to human-centered exploration of entity-rich text
data by combining graph visualization, interactive refinement, and adaptable
perspectives on relationships.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本研究探讨CS1学生如何在编程任务中使用LLMs，发现学生采用伪学徒模式，过度依赖AI解决方案而缺乏独立问题解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等LLMs成为学生编程工具的一部分，需要了解学生如何将其整合到问题解决过程中，以及这对学习的影响。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，14名本科生完成三个编程任务（开放性和熟悉度不同），通过出声思维、调查和访谈收集数据。

Result: 学生频繁采用伪学徒模式，专注于LLMs提供的专家级解决方案，但未能参与促进独立问题解决的认知学徒阶段。学生意图、行动和自我认知行为之间存在脱节。

Conclusion: 需要设计和教学干预来促进学习，解决观察到的依赖AI使用模式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have quickly become part of
student programmers' toolkits, whether allowed by instructors or not. This
paper examines how introductory programming (CS1) students integrate LLMs into
their problem-solving processes. We conducted a mixed-methods study with 14
undergraduates completing three programming tasks while thinking aloud and
permitted to access any resources they choose. The tasks varied in
open-endedness and familiarity to the participants and were followed by surveys
and interviews. We find that students frequently adopt a pattern we call
pseudo-apprenticeship, where students engage attentively with expert-level
solutions provided by LLMs but fail to participate in the stages of cognitive
apprenticeship that promote independent problem-solving. This pattern was
augmented by disconnects between students' intentions, actions, and
self-perceived behavior when using LLMs. We offer design and instructional
interventions for promoting learning and addressing the patterns of dependent
AI use observed.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: WAREX是一个评估浏览器LLM代理在真实网络环境下可靠性的框架，通过在现有基准测试中引入网络不稳定性和网站攻击等现实因素，发现当前最先进代理的鲁棒性有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在受控环境中评估LLM代理性能，忽略了真实世界中网络不稳定、HTTPS连接问题和网站攻击等现实挑战，需要评估代理在真实环境下的可靠性。

Method: 提出WAREX框架，在三个流行基准测试（WebArena、WebVoyager、REAL）中引入网络不稳定性和网站攻击等现实因素，测量代理在这些条件下的表现。

Result: 实验显示引入WAREX后任务成功率显著下降，表明当前最先进代理在面对真实世界网络不稳定性和网站攻击时鲁棒性有限。

Conclusion: WAREX揭示了现有LLM代理在真实网络环境中的可靠性问题，强调了在基准测试中考虑现实世界因素的重要性，为开发更鲁棒的浏览器代理提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in browser-based LLM agents have shown promise for automating
tasks ranging from simple form filling to hotel booking or online shopping.
Current benchmarks measure agent performance in controlled environments, such
as containers or stable networks, where websites behave deterministically.
However, in the real world, users access websites over networks and HTTPS
connections that introduce instability from multiple sources: client-side,
server-side issues or broader system failures. Moreover, live websites are
prone to web attacks such Cross-Site Scripting, as well as general site
modifications which can cause unexpected or malicious pop-ups or improper
functionality. To address this gap, we present WAREX: Web Agent Reliability
Evaluation on Existing Benchmarks. We measure the impact of WAREX across three
popular benchmarks: WebArena, WebVoyager, and REAL. Our experiments show that
introducing WAREX leads to significant drops in task success rates,
highlighting the limited robustness of state-of-the-art agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不可再生能源稀缺、地缘政治问题、价格上涨和气候变化迫使制造业开发更节能的解决方案，混合流水车间调度是减少能耗的有效方法。

Method: 首先建立了多目标混合整数规划模型，提出了增强ε约束法寻找帕累托最优解，并开发了改进迭代帕累托贪婪算法处理大规模实例。

Result: 通过小、中、大规模实例验证了方法的有效性，与两种知名算法比较显示所提方法表现优异。

Conclusion: 所提出的多目标优化方法能有效解决混合流水车间调度中的能耗和完工时间冲突问题，在合理时间内找到高质量解。

Abstract: The scarcity of non-renewable energy sources, geopolitical problems in its
supply, increasing prices, and the impact of climate change, force the global
economy to develop more energy-efficient solutions for their operations. The
Manufacturing sector is not excluded from this challenge as one of the largest
consumers of energy. Energy-efficient scheduling is a method that attracts
manufacturing companies to reduce their consumption as it can be quickly
deployed and can show impact immediately. In this study, the hybrid flow shop
scheduling problem with blocking constraint (BHFS) is investigated in which we
seek to minimize the latest completion time (i.e. makespan) and overall energy
consumption, a typical manufacturing setting across many industries from
automotive to pharmaceutical. Energy consumption and the latest completion time
of customer orders are usually conflicting objectives. Therefore, we first
formulate the problem as a novel multi-objective mixed integer programming
(MIP) model and propose an augmented epsilon-constraint method for finding the
Pareto-optimal solutions. Also, an effective multi-objective metaheuristic
algorithm. Refined Iterated Pareto Greedy (RIPG), is developed to solve large
instances in reasonable time. Our proposed methods are benchmarked using small,
medium, and large-size instances to evaluate their efficiency. Two well-known
algorithms are adopted for comparing our novel approaches. The computational
results show the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了10个大型语言模型的自我识别能力，发现模型普遍存在自我识别失败，仅4/10模型能识别自身生成文本，且性能很少超过随机水平。模型还表现出对GPT和Claude家族的强烈偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对AI系统是否具备自我识别能力这一争议性问题，建立系统评估框架来检验当代大语言模型的自我识别能力，这对AI安全和心理分析都很重要。

Method: 通过二元自我识别和精确模型预测两个任务，测量10个当代大语言模型识别自身生成文本与其他模型文本的能力。

Result: 结果显示模型自我识别一致失败，仅40%模型能识别自身生成文本，性能接近随机水平。模型存在对GPT和Claude家族的强烈偏见，并表现出对模型存在性的层次认知偏见。

Conclusion: 研究发现当前大语言模型缺乏可靠的自我识别能力，这对AI安全具有重要意义，需要进一步开发适当的AI自我意识。

Abstract: Self-recognition is a crucial metacognitive capability for AI systems,
relevant not only for psychological analysis but also for safety, particularly
in evaluative scenarios. Motivated by contradictory interpretations of whether
models possess self-recognition (Panickssery et al., 2024; Davidson et al.,
2024), we introduce a systematic evaluation framework that can be easily
applied and updated. Specifically, we measure how well 10 contemporary larger
language models (LLMs) can identify their own generated text versus text from
other models through two tasks: binary self-recognition and exact model
prediction. Different from prior claims, our results reveal a consistent
failure in self-recognition. Only 4 out of 10 models predict themselves as
generators, and the performance is rarely above random chance. Additionally,
models exhibit a strong bias toward predicting GPT and Claude families. We also
provide the first evaluation of model awareness of their own and others'
existence, as well as the reasoning behind their choices in self-recognition.
We find that the model demonstrates some knowledge of its own existence and
other models, but their reasoning reveals a hierarchical bias. They appear to
assume that GPT, Claude, and occasionally Gemini are the top-tier models, often
associating high-quality text with them. We conclude by discussing the
implications of our findings on AI safety and future directions to develop
appropriate AI self-awareness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中RAG系统检索到的证据可能存在矛盾，导致输出不一致或不可信，这在合规性、治理和问责制至关重要的企业环境中尤其成问题。现有矛盾检测基准仅限于句子级分析，无法捕捉企业文档的复杂性。

Method: 结合自动化矛盾挖掘和人工验证，生成包含嵌入矛盾的企业风格合成文档，建立企业流程中常见矛盾类型的分类体系，支持受控创建自矛盾和成对矛盾，开发矛盾感知的检索评估流程。

Result: 构建了专门针对企业领域的矛盾感知基准框架，能够系统评估文档内和跨文档一致性，为更可信和可问责的企业RAG系统奠定基础。

Conclusion: 这项工作为企业信息检索应用中检测和解决矛盾提供了重要基础，有助于降低风险并确保合规性，推动更可信赖的RAG系统发展。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates LLMs with external sources,
offering advanced capabilities for information access and decision-making.
However, contradictions in retrieved evidence can result in inconsistent or
untrustworthy outputs, which is especially problematic in enterprise settings
where compliance, governance, and accountability are critical. Existing
benchmarks for contradiction detection are limited to sentence-level analysis
and do not capture the complexity of enterprise documents such as contracts,
financial filings, compliance reports, or policy manuals. To address this
limitation, we propose ContraGen, a contradiction-aware benchmark framework
tailored to enterprise domain. The framework generates synthetic
enterprise-style documents with embedded contradictions, enabling systematic
evaluation of both intra-document and cross-document consistency. Automated
contradiction mining is combined with human-in-the-loop validation to ensure
high accuracy. Our contributions include generating realistic enterprise
documents, modeling a taxonomy of contradiction types common in business
processes, enabling controlled creation of self- and pairwise contradictions,
developing a contradiction-aware retrieval evaluation pipeline and embedding
human oversight to reflect domain-specific judgment complexity. This work
establishes a foundation for more trustworthy and accountable RAG systems in
enterprise information-seeking applications, where detecting and resolving
contradictions is essential for reducing risk and ensuring compliance.

Conclusion: 通过广泛的评估视角可以有效地比较认知架构和生成架构，为这些复杂架构系统的评估提供了可行的方法。

Abstract: Evaluation is a critical activity associated with any theory. Yet this has
proven to be an exceptionally challenging activity for theories based on
cognitive architectures. For an overlapping set of reasons, evaluation can also
be challenging for theories based on generative neural architectures. This dual
challenge is approached here by leveraging a broad perspective on theory
evaluation to yield a wide-ranging, albeit qualitative, comparison of
whole-mind-oriented cognitive and generative architectures and the full systems
that are based on these architectures.

Motivation: 需要系统评估自然语言计划与预期行为的一致性，确保计划执行的正确性。

Method: 使用大语言模型将自然语言计划转换为Kripke结构和线性时序逻辑公式，然后进行模型检查验证。

Result: GPT-5在PlanBench数据集上达到96.3%的F1分数，能生成语法完美的形式化表示，但语义完美性仍需改进。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效验证计划对齐，在分类性能上表现优异，但语义建模仍需进一步探索。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for evaluating the alignment between natural
language plans and their expected behavior by converting them into Kripke
structures and Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using Large Language Models (LLMs)
and performing model checking. We systematically evaluate this framework on a
simplified version of the PlanBench plan verification dataset and report on
metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 scores. Our experiments
demonstrate that GPT-5 achieves excellent classification performance (F1 score
of 96.3%) while almost always producing syntactically perfect formal
representations that can act as guarantees. However, the synthesis of
semantically perfect formal models remains an area for future exploration.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation via Reinforcement Learning (PCGRL) offers a
method for training controllable level designer agents without the need for
human datasets, using metrics that serve as proxies for level quality as
rewards. Existing PCGRL research focuses on single generator agents, but are
bottlenecked by the need to frequently recalculate heuristics of level quality
and the agent's need to navigate around potentially large maps. By framing
level generation as a multi-agent problem, we mitigate the efficiency
bottleneck of single-agent PCGRL by reducing the number of reward calculations
relative to the number of agent actions. We also find that multi-agent level
generators are better able to generalize to out-of-distribution map shapes,
which we argue is due to the generators' learning more local, modular design
policies. We conclude that treating content generation as a distributed,
multi-agent task is beneficial for generating functional artifacts at scale.

### [448] [Towards Policy-Compliant Agents: Learning Efficient Guardrails For Policy Violation Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03485)
*Xiaofei Wen,Wenjie Jacky Mo,Yanan Xie,Peng Qi,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PolicyGuardBench基准和PolicyGuard-4B模型，用于检测网络智能体轨迹中的策略违规行为，支持跨域泛化和小规模高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究很少关注自主网络智能体在生成长视野轨迹时是否遵守外部策略，以及策略违规在不同上下文（如不同领域和子领域）中的持续性。

Method: 从多样化的智能体运行中生成广泛的策略集，创建包含违规标签的子域内和跨子域配对，并引入基于前缀的违规检测任务。训练了轻量级的PolicyGuard-4B护栏模型。

Result: PolicyGuard-4B在所有任务上实现了强大的检测准确性，同时保持推理效率，并在未见过的设置上保持高准确性，能够跨域泛化。

Conclusion: PolicyGuardBench和PolicyGuard-4B为研究网络智能体轨迹的策略合规性提供了首个综合框架，证明在小规模上实现准确且可泛化的护栏是可行的。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents need to operate under externally imposed or
human-specified policies while generating long-horizon trajectories. However,
little work has examined whether these trajectories comply with such policies,
or whether policy violations persist across different contexts such as domains
(e.g., shopping or coding websites) and subdomains (e.g., product search and
order management in shopping). To address this gap, we introduce
PolicyGuardBench, a benchmark of about 60k examples for detecting policy
violations in agent trajectories. From diverse agent runs, we generate a broad
set of policies and create both within subdomain and cross subdomain pairings
with violation labels. In addition to full-trajectory evaluation,
PolicyGuardBench also includes a prefix-based violation detection task where
models must anticipate policy violations from truncated trajectory prefixes
rather than complete sequences. Using this dataset, we train PolicyGuard-4B, a
lightweight guardrail model that delivers strong detection accuracy across all
tasks while keeping inference efficient. Notably, PolicyGuard-4B generalizes
across domains and preserves high accuracy on unseen settings. Together,
PolicyGuardBench and PolicyGuard-4B provide the first comprehensive framework
for studying policy compliance in web agent trajectories, and show that
accurate and generalizable guardrails are feasible at small scales.

Motivation: 解决AI对齐和语言游戏中大策略空间带来的挑战，探索在玩家策略空间中存在未知子集持续获得更高奖励的情况下，如何设计高效算法来发现和利用这种隐藏结构。

Method: 开发了一种遗憾最小化技术的组合方法，实现了最优的外部遗憾和交换遗憾界限，利用隐藏游戏结构提高计算效率。

Result: 该方法能够快速收敛到隐藏子游戏中的相关均衡，同时保持一般情况下的理性，为处理大策略空间游戏提供了有效解决方案。

Conclusion: 研究肯定地回答了能否设计高效遗憾最小化算法来发现和利用隐藏结构的问题，为AI对齐和语言游戏等领域提供了理论基础和实用方法。

Abstract: This paper investigates a class of games with large strategy spaces,
motivated by challenges in AI alignment and language games. We introduce the
hidden game problem, where for each player, an unknown subset of strategies
consistently yields higher rewards compared to the rest. The central question
is whether efficient regret minimization algorithms can be designed to discover
and exploit such hidden structures, leading to equilibrium in these subgames
while maintaining rationality in general. We answer this question affirmatively
by developing a composition of regret minimization techniques that achieve
optimal external and swap regret bounds. Our approach ensures rapid convergence
to correlated equilibria in hidden subgames, leveraging the hidden game
structure for improved computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自回归模型在文本和图像生成中强制因果顺序的限制，实现更灵活的并发多模态生成。

Method: 结合插入式编辑流处理离散文本标记，使用流匹配处理图像潜在表示，通过分层采样优先内容而非语法。

Result: 在1B到8B模型规模上，OneFlow在生成和理解任务上均优于自回归基线，训练FLOPs减少50%，超越自回归和扩散方法。

Conclusion: OneFlow解锁了并发生成、迭代优化和类自然推理等新能力，为非自回归多模态生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We present OneFlow, the first non-autoregressive multimodal model that
enables variable-length and concurrent mixed-modal generation. Unlike
autoregressive models that enforce rigid causal ordering between text and image
generation, OneFlow combines an insertion-based Edit Flow for discrete text
tokens with Flow Matching for image latents. OneFlow enables concurrent
text-image synthesis with hierarchical sampling that prioritizes content over
grammar. Through controlled experiments across model sizes from 1B to 8B, we
demonstrate that OneFlow outperforms autoregressive baselines on both
generation and understanding tasks while using up to 50% fewer training FLOPs.
OneFlow surpasses both autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches while
unlocking new capabilities for concurrent generation, iterative refinement, and
natural reasoning-like generation.

*Ondřej Kubíček,Viliam Lisý*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LAMIR算法通过学习不完美信息游戏的抽象模型，使预训练AI代理能够在测试时进行前瞻推理，解决了传统方法在大型游戏中无法扩展的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中不完美信息游戏的环境模型往往不可得或过于复杂，而MuZero等完美信息游戏的方法难以直接扩展到不完美信息场景，需要更精细的前瞻推理技术。

Method: LAMIR算法直接从智能体-环境交互中学习不完美信息游戏的抽象模型，在测试时使用训练好的模型进行前瞻推理，通过学习抽象化将每个子游戏限制在可管理的大小。

Result: 实验表明，在足够容量下LAMIR能学习到精确的底层游戏结构，在有限容量下仍能学习到有价值的抽象，提升预训练智能体在大型游戏中的表现。

Conclusion: LAMIR通过模型抽象化使理论上合理的前瞻推理在大型不完美信息游戏中变得可行，显著提升了预训练智能体的游戏性能。

Abstract: Test-time reasoning significantly enhances pre-trained AI agents'
performance. However, it requires an explicit environment model, often
unavailable or overly complex in real-world scenarios. While MuZero enables
effective model learning for search in perfect information games, extending
this paradigm to imperfect information games presents substantial challenges
due to more nuanced look-ahead reasoning techniques and large number of states
relevant for individual decisions. This paper introduces an algorithm LAMIR
that learns an abstracted model of an imperfect information game directly from
the agent-environment interaction. During test time, this trained model is used
to perform look-ahead reasoning. The learned abstraction limits the size of
each subgame to a manageable size, making theoretically principled look-ahead
reasoning tractable even in games where previous methods could not scale. We
empirically demonstrate that with sufficient capacity, LAMIR learns the exact
underlying game structure, and with limited capacity, it still learns a
valuable abstraction, which improves game playing performance of the
pre-trained agents even in large games.

TL;DR: 本文研究了测试时计算扩展对Transformer模型推理能力的影响，发现在线性回归任务中，增加测试时计算可以降低训练所需上下文长度，但前提是训练数据包含足够的相关技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管测试时扩展（如长思维链）能提升LLMs的推理性能，但其在训练数据中的出现条件以及何时有效仍不明确。本文旨在从理论上解释测试时扩展的工作原理。

Method: 通过分析Transformer在上下文权重预测任务（线性回归）上的表现，建立理论框架，并用大型非线性Transformer架构进行实验验证。

Result: 研究发现：1）固定测试误差下，增加测试计算可减少训练上下文长度；2）若训练数据缺乏相关技能，增加测试计算反而有害；3）任务难度与特征协方差矩阵最小特征值相关。

Conclusion: 在多样化、相关且困难的任务集上训练，结合测试时计算扩展，能获得最佳性能。任务难度特征值可作为训练数据选择的指导指标。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating extra compute to generate longer Chains-of-Thoughts
(CoTs). This enables models to tackle more complex problem by breaking them
down into additional steps, backtracking, and correcting mistakes. Despite its
strong performance--demonstrated by OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek R1, the conditions
in the training data under which long CoTs emerge, and when such long CoTs
improve the performance, remain unclear. In this paper, we study the
performance of test-time scaling for transformers trained on an in-context
weight prediction task for linear regression. Our analysis provides a
theoretical explanation for several intriguing observations: First, at any
fixed test error, increasing test-time compute allows us to reduce the number
of in-context examples (context length) in training prompts. Second, if the
skills required to solve a downstream task are not sufficiently present in the
training data, increasing test-time compute can harm performance. Finally, we
characterize task hardness via the smallest eigenvalue of its feature
covariance matrix and show that training on a diverse, relevant, and hard set
of tasks results in best performance for test-time scaling. We confirm our
findings with experiments on large, nonlinear transformer architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为跨模态偏好引导（CPS）的新型攻击方法，通过联合优化视觉和文本通道的不可察觉修改，在现实的黑盒威胁设置下显著提升对基于视觉语言模型的网络代理的偏好操纵效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明基于视觉语言模型的网络代理容易受到偏好操纵攻击，但现有方法要么假设强白盒访问权限，要么使用不切实际的设置。本文旨在证明在现实攻击者能力下，联合利用视觉和文本通道可以产生更强大的偏好操纵。

Method: 提出跨模态偏好引导（CPS）方法，联合优化项目视觉和自然语言描述的不可察觉修改，利用CLIP可迁移图像扰动和RLHF诱导的语言偏见来引导代理决策。采用现实的黑盒威胁设置，攻击者只能编辑自己列表的图像和文本元数据，无法访问代理模型内部。

Result: 在GPT-4.1、Qwen-2.5VL和Pixtral-Large等最先进的专有和开源视觉语言模型上进行评估，结果显示CPS在所有模型上都显著优于基线方法，同时保持70%更低的检测率，证明了其有效性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了随着代理系统在社会中扮演越来越重要的角色，迫切需要开发强大的防御机制来应对此类跨模态偏好操纵攻击。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM)-based web agents increasingly power high-stakes
selection tasks like content recommendation or product ranking by combining
multimodal perception with preference reasoning. Recent studies reveal that
these agents are vulnerable against attackers who can bias selection outcomes
through preference manipulations using adversarial pop-ups, image
perturbations, or content tweaks. Existing work, however, either assumes strong
white-box access, with limited single-modal perturbations, or uses impractical
settings. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, that joint
exploitation of visual and textual channels yields significantly more powerful
preference manipulations under realistic attacker capabilities. We introduce
Cross-Modal Preference Steering (CPS) that jointly optimizes imperceptible
modifications to an item's visual and natural language descriptions, exploiting
CLIP-transferable image perturbations and RLHF-induced linguistic biases to
steer agent decisions. In contrast to prior studies that assume gradient
access, or control over webpages, or agent memory, we adopt a realistic
black-box threat setup: a non-privileged adversary can edit only their own
listing's images and textual metadata, with no insight into the agent's model
internals. We evaluate CPS on agents powered by state-of-the-art proprietary
and open source VLMs including GPT-4.1, Qwen-2.5VL and Pixtral-Large on both
movie selection and e-commerce tasks. Our results show that CPS is
significantly more effective than leading baseline methods. For instance, our
results show that CPS consistently outperforms baselines across all models
while maintaining 70% lower detection rates, demonstrating both effectiveness
and stealth. These findings highlight an urgent need for robust defenses as
agentic systems play an increasingly consequential role in society.

TL;DR: 提出了基于互信息的树搜索框架MITS，通过点互信息评分函数和动态采样策略，在保持计算效率的同时提升大语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有树搜索方法难以对中间推理步骤进行即时可靠的量化评估，且广泛路径探索计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用点互信息作为评分函数指导推理路径评估和搜索树扩展，结合基于熵的动态采样策略自适应分配计算资源，最后采用加权投票方案进行预测。

Result: 在多样化推理基准测试中，MITS持续超越基线方法。

Conclusion: MITS为LLM推理建立了一个原则性且高效的框架。

Abstract: Tree search has become as a representative framework for test-time reasoning
with large language models (LLMs), exemplified by methods such as
Tree-of-Thought and Monte Carlo Tree Search that explore multiple reasoning
paths. However, it remains difficult to provide instant and reliable
quantitative assessments of intermediate reasoning step quality, and extensive
path exploration is computationally costly. To address this, we propose Mutual
Information Tree Search (MITS), a novel framework that guides reasoning with
information-theoretic principles. MITS introduces an effective scoring function
based on pointwise mutual information (PMI), which enables step-wise evaluation
of reasoning paths and search tree expansion via beam search without expensive
look-ahead simulations, achieving superior reasoning performances while
maintaining computational efficiency. The framework is complemented by an
entropy-based dynamic sampling strategy that adaptively allocates computational
resources to uncertain reasoning steps where exploration is most beneficial.
For final prediction, MITS employs a weighted voting scheme that combines PMI
scores with prediction consensus. Through comprehensive experiments on diverse
reasoning benchmarks, MITS consistently surpasses baseline methods,
establishing a principled and efficient framework for LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)存在"<eos>溢出"问题：随着序列长度增加，响应反而变短，导致提前终止或退化为<eos>令牌流。作者提出Rainbow Padding方法，用循环的不同填充令牌替换重复的<eos>占位符来解决此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指令调优的扩散大语言模型存在一个关键漏洞——<eos>溢出问题，即随着分配序列长度的增加，模型响应反而变得更短，出现提前终止或退化为<eos>令牌流的现象。这个问题在实践中已被注意到，但尚未得到系统分析。

Method: 提出Rainbow Padding方法：用循环的不同填充令牌替换重复的<eos>占位符，分散概率质量，打破<eos>的主导地位。该方法可以高效集成到现有指令调优模型中，仅需在少量数据上进行单轮LoRA微调即可显著改进。

Result: 实验表明Rainbow Padding显著提高了长度鲁棒性和输出质量，仅需七个填充令牌就足以防止提前终止。该方法在现有指令调优模型上的集成效率高，LoRA单轮微调即可获得显著改进。

Conclusion: Rainbow Padding是一种简单有效的解决方案，通过打破<eos>令牌在填充中的主导地位，解决了扩散大语言模型的<eos>溢出问题，提高了模型的长度鲁棒性和输出质量，且具有很高的实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive models, offering flexible generation orders and
strong performance on complex reasoning tasks. However, instruction-tuned dLLMs
exhibit a critical vulnerability we term \texttt{<eos>} overflow: as allocated
sequence length increases, responses paradoxically become shorter, collapsing
into early termination or degenerating into streams of \texttt{<eos>} tokens.
Although noticed in practice, this issue has not been systematically analyzed.
We trace its root cause to the dual role of \texttt{<eos>} as both termination
and padding, which concentrates probability mass on \texttt{<eos>} at later
positions and propagates backward to trigger early termination. To address
this, we introduce Rainbow Padding, a simple remedy that replaces repeated
\texttt{<eos>} placeholders with a repeating cycle of distinct padding tokens,
distributing probability mass and breaking \texttt{<eos>} dominance.
Experiments show that Rainbow Padding substantially improves length robustness
and output quality, with as few as seven padding tokens sufficient to prevent
early termination. Moreover, the method integrates efficiently into existing
instruction-tuned models: LoRA fine-tuning for a single epoch on minimal data
yields significant improvements, making this solution highly practical. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/quasar529/rainbow-padding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要在轮次层面评估聊天机器人交互，无法判断用户整体目标是否达成，需要更全面的目标导向评估框架。

Method: 使用目标分割对话，结合教师LLM进行评估，LLM通过"思考标记"生成可解释的推理过程，实现数据高效的可解释评估。

Result: 在企业环境中应用该框架评估AIDA系统，观察到目标成功率从63%提升到79%。

Conclusion: 该框架是通用的，通过详细的缺陷分类提供可操作的见解，能够诊断整体成功率、识别关键失败模式并指导系统改进。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn chatbot interactions remains
challenging, as most existing methods assess interactions at the turn level
without addressing whether a user's overarching goal was fulfilled. A ``goal''
here refers to an information need or task, such as asking for policy
information or applying for leave. We propose a comprehensive framework for
goal-oriented evaluation of multi-agent systems (MAS), introducing the
\textbf{Goal Success Rate (GSR)} to measure the percentage of fulfilled goals,
and a \textbf{Root Cause of Failure (RCOF)} taxonomy to identify reasons for
failure in multi-agent chatbots. Our method segments conversations by user
goals and evaluates success using all relevant turns. We present a model-based
evaluation system combining teacher LLMs, where domain experts define goals,
set quality standards serving as a guidance for the LLMs. The LLMs use
``thinking tokens'' to produce interpretable rationales, enabling
\textit{explainable}, \textit{data-efficient} evaluations. In an enterprise
setting, we apply our framework to evaluate AIDA, a zero-to-one employee
conversational agent system built as a ground-up multi-agent conversational
agent, and observe GSR improvement from 63\% to 79\% over six months since its
inception. Our framework is generic and offers actionable insights through a
detailed defect taxonomy based on analysis of failure points in multi-agent
chatbots, diagnosing overall success, identifying key failure modes, and
informing system improvements.

TL;DR: 提出了H-DDx分层评估框架，用于更准确地评估大语言模型在医学鉴别诊断中的表现，克服传统扁平指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在医学鉴别诊断评估中主要依赖Top-k准确率等扁平指标，无法区分临床相关的近似错误和诊断上相距较远的错误，需要更符合临床相关性的评估方法。

Method: H-DDx框架采用检索和重排序流程将自由文本诊断映射到ICD-10代码，并应用分层指标来奖励与真实诊断密切相关的预测。

Result: 在22个领先模型的基准测试中，传统扁平指标低估了性能，忽略了临床有意义的输出；领域专用开源模型表现突出；框架揭示了分层错误模式，显示LLM即使错过精确诊断也能正确识别更广泛的临床背景。

Conclusion: H-DDx框架提供了更准确、更符合临床实践的LLM鉴别诊断评估方法，增强了结果的可解释性，有助于更好地理解模型在医学诊断中的表现。

Abstract: An accurate differential diagnosis (DDx) is essential for patient care,
shaping therapeutic decisions and influencing outcomes. Recently, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools to support this process
by generating a DDx list from patient narratives. However, existing evaluations
of LLMs in this domain primarily rely on flat metrics, such as Top-k accuracy,
which fail to distinguish between clinically relevant near-misses and
diagnostically distant errors. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce H-DDx,
a hierarchical evaluation framework that better reflects clinical relevance.
H-DDx leverages a retrieval and reranking pipeline to map free-text diagnoses
to ICD-10 codes and applies a hierarchical metric that credits predictions
closely related to the ground-truth diagnosis. In benchmarking 22 leading
models, we show that conventional flat metrics underestimate performance by
overlooking clinically meaningful outputs, with our results highlighting the
strengths of domain-specialized open-source models. Furthermore, our framework
enhances interpretability by revealing hierarchical error patterns,
demonstrating that LLMs often correctly identify the broader clinical context
even when the precise diagnosis is missed.

Motivation: 受人类多感官理解世界的启发，当前的多模态基础模型缺乏作为有效世界模型的关键能力，如反事实推理、动态模拟、时空信息理解和可控生成等。

Method: 通过判别性任务提升推理能力，赋予结构化推理技能；开发结构化可控生成框架，结合场景图、多模态条件和对齐策略；扩展到可控4D生成。

Conclusion: 通过增强推理和生成能力，多模态基础模型可以更好地模拟和理解动态物理过程，向真正的世界模型迈进。

Abstract: Humans understand the world through the integration of multiple sensory
modalities, enabling them to perceive, reason about, and imagine dynamic
physical processes. Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models
(MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and
generation. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world
models. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual
reasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information,
control generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We
investigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation
models and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of
MFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning
skills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal
reasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand
deeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore
generative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and
video modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable
generation. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning,
and multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring
consistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent. We further
extend these techniques to controllable 4D generation, enabling interactive,
editable, and morphable object synthesis over time and space.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"推测性动作"的无损框架，通过使用更快的模型预测可能的动作，使多个步骤能够并行执行，从而显著降低智能体系统的端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体在环境中的执行通常很慢，阻碍了训练、评估和部署。例如，两个最先进的国际象棋智能体之间的对弈可能需要数小时，关键瓶颈在于智能体行为是按顺序展开的，每个动作都需要API调用，这些调用可能很耗时。

Method: 受微处理器中的推测执行和LLM推理中的推测解码启发，提出推测性动作框架，使用更快的模型预测可能的动作，实现多步骤并行执行。评估了游戏、电子商务、网络搜索等环境，并提出了操作系统的"有损"扩展。

Result: 在所有测试环境中，推测性动作在下一动作预测方面实现了显著的准确性（高达55%），转化为端到端延迟的显著降低。通过更强的猜测模型、top-K动作预测、多步骤推测和不确定性感知优化，性能可以进一步提升。

Conclusion: 推测性动作为在现实世界中部署低延迟智能体系统开辟了一条有前景的道路，通过并行执行显著提高了智能体系统的响应速度。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in AI agents across industry and academia, their
execution in an environment is often slow, hampering training, evaluation, and
deployment. For example, a game of chess between two state-of-the-art agents
may take hours. A critical bottleneck is that agent behavior unfolds
sequentially: each action requires an API call, and these calls can be
time-consuming. Inspired by speculative execution in microprocessors and
speculative decoding in LLM inference, we propose speculative actions, a
lossless framework for general agentic systems that predicts likely actions
using faster models, enabling multiple steps to be executed in parallel. We
evaluate this framework across three agentic environments: gaming, e-commerce,
web search, and a "lossy" extension for an operating systems environment. In
all cases, speculative actions achieve substantial accuracy in next-action
prediction (up to 55%), translating into significant reductions in end-to-end
latency. Moreover, performance can be further improved through stronger
guessing models, top-K action prediction, multi-step speculation, and
uncertainty-aware optimization, opening a promising path toward deploying
low-latency agentic systems in the real world.

Motivation: LLM在可验证任务中表现优异，但在缺乏单一正确答案的主观任务（如电商查询改写）中部署困难，需要可靠评估方法。

Method: 使用多个LLM智能体模拟购物顾客作为动态奖励信号，结合遗传算法迭代优化用户初始查询。

Result: 在5个不同类别的1000个真实电商查询上测试，平均比原始查询提升21.98%，比最佳N次LLM改写基线提升3.36%。

Conclusion: OptAgent框架能有效优化电商查询改写，通过多智能体模拟提供可靠的评估信号，解决了主观任务的评估挑战。

Abstract: Deploying capable and user-aligned LLM-based systems necessitates reliable
evaluation. While LLMs excel in verifiable tasks like coding and mathematics,
where gold-standard solutions are available, adoption remains challenging for
subjective tasks that lack a single correct answer. E-commerce Query Rewriting
(QR) is one such problem where determining whether a rewritten query properly
captures the user intent is extremely difficult to figure out algorithmically.
In this work, we introduce OptAgent, a novel framework that combines
multi-agent simulations with genetic algorithms to verify and optimize queries
for QR. Instead of relying on a static reward model or a single LLM judge, our
approach uses multiple LLM-based agents, each acting as a simulated shopping
customer, as a dynamic reward signal. The average of these agent-derived scores
serves as an effective fitness function for an evolutionary algorithm that
iteratively refines the user's initial query. We evaluate OptAgent on a dataset
of 1000 real-world e-commerce queries in five different categories, and we
observe an average improvement of 21.98% over the original user query and 3.36%
over a Best-of-N LLM rewriting baseline.

*Divij Handa,Mihir Parmar,Aswin RRV,Md Nayem Uddin,Hamid Palangi,Chitta Baral*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GuidedSampling推理算法，通过分离探索和生成阶段来增加解决方案的多样性，相比传统重复采样在多个基准上平均提升21.6%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重复采样算法在推理时难以生成多样化的解决方案候选，经常依赖相同的基础方法解决问题，产生冗余样本。

Method: GuidedSampling将推理过程解耦为探索阶段和生成阶段：探索阶段识别多个可用于解决问题的概念，生成阶段应用特定概念提供最终解决方案候选。

Result: 在pass@50指标上平均提升21.6%；使用GuidedSampling轨迹训练的模型在pass@5上平均提升9.7%；每个实例的平均概念数量从1.67增加到3.03。

Conclusion: GuidedSampling通过增加解决方案多样性显著提升模型性能，且训练出的模型能产生更多样化的候选方案。

Abstract: Repeated Sampling (RS) is a simple inference-time algorithm that has been
shown to improve model performance on complex tasks. Although it is an
effective way of scaling inference time, it often struggles to generate diverse
solution candidates, frequently relying on the same underlying approach to
solve the problem and thus producing redundant samples. To address this
limitation, we propose a new inference algorithm, GuidedSampling, which
decouples the exploration and generation phases during inference, increasing
diversity of generated candidate solutions. The exploration phase identifies
multiple concepts that can be utilized to solve the problem, while the
generation phase applies a specific concept to provide final solution
candidates. We first define the theoretical bounds of GuidedSampling and then
empirically demonstrate that it improves the performance of base model at
pass@50 by on an average ~21.6% across various benchmarks compared to RS.
Furthermore, models trained on trajectories of GuidedSampling exhibit
substantial performance improvements at pass@5 by on an average ~9.7%, compared
to models trained on traditional RS. Additionally, models trained with
GuidedSampling increases the average number of concepts per instance (1.67 ->
3.03), yielding a diverse set of candidates than traditional RS.

*Dongge Han,Camille Couturier,Daniel Madrigal Diaz,Xuchao Zhang,Victor Rühle,Saravan Rajmohan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LEGOMem是一个用于多智能体工作流自动化的模块化程序记忆框架，通过分解历史任务轨迹为可重用记忆单元，支持规划与执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多智能体系统中记忆的设计空间，研究记忆应该放置在何处、如何检索以及哪些智能体受益最多。

Method: 将过去任务轨迹分解为可重用记忆单元，灵活分配给编排器和任务智能体，支持规划和执行。在OfficeBench基准上进行实验。

Result: 编排器记忆对任务分解和委派至关重要，细粒度智能体记忆提高执行准确性。较小模型团队通过程序记忆显著受益，缩小与更强智能体的性能差距。

Conclusion: LEGOMem既是记忆增强智能体系统的实用框架，也是理解多智能体工作流自动化中记忆设计的研究工具。

Abstract: We introduce LEGOMem, a modular procedural memory framework for multi-agent
large language model (LLM) systems in workflow automation. LEGOMem decomposes
past task trajectories into reusable memory units and flexibly allocates them
across orchestrators and task agents to support planning and execution. To
explore the design space of memory in multi-agent systems, we use LEGOMem as a
lens and conduct a systematic study of procedural memory in multi-agent
systems, examining where memory should be placed, how it should be retrieved,
and which agents benefit most. Experiments on the OfficeBench benchmark show
that orchestrator memory is critical for effective task decomposition and
delegation, while fine-grained agent memory improves execution accuracy. We
find that even teams composed of smaller language models can benefit
substantially from procedural memory, narrowing the performance gap with
stronger agents by leveraging prior execution traces for more accurate planning
and tool use. These results position LEGOMem as both a practical framework for
memory-augmented agent systems and a research tool for understanding memory
design in multi-agent workflow automation.

### [463] [Small Language Models for Agentic Systems: A Survey of Architectures, Capabilities, and Deployment Trade offs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03847)
*Raghav Sharma,Manan Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 小语言模型（1-20B参数）在代理任务中通常优于大模型，具有更低的成本、延迟和能耗。通过引导解码、严格JSON Schema输出和验证器优先的工具执行，SLM在工具使用、函数调用和RAG等任务上能达到或超越LLM的性能，同时成本降低10-100倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在证明小语言模型在受约束的代理任务中比大模型更高效，通过优化工程指标如成本、延迟和能耗，为构建快速、经济、可靠的代理系统提供实用蓝图。

Method: 采用引导解码库（XGrammar, Outlines）、严格JSON Schema输出、验证器优先工具执行，结合不确定性感知路由和验证器级联的SLM默认、LLM回退系统，使用LoRA/QLoRA进行轻量级适配。

Result: SLM在工具使用、函数调用和RAG任务上能匹配或超越LLM，同时token成本降低10-100倍，延迟和能耗显著改善。

Conclusion: 小语言模型是构建高效代理系统的优选，通过适当的设计模式可在大多数任务中替代大模型，仅在开放域推理和长时规划等特定场景需要LLM回退。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs; 1-12B params, sometimes up to 20B) are
sufficient and often superior for agentic workloads where the objective is
schema- and API-constrained accuracy rather than open-ended generation. We
synthesize recent evidence across open and proprietary SLMs (Phi-4-Mini,
Qwen-2.5-7B, Gemma-2-9B, Llama-3.2-1B/3B, Ministral-3B/8B, Apple on-device 3B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill) and connect it to modern evaluations (BFCL v3/v4,
StableToolBench) and serving stacks (vLLM, SGLang, TensorRT-LLM) paired with
guided decoding libraries (XGrammar, Outlines). We formalize SLM-default,
LLM-fallback systems with uncertainty-aware routing and verifier cascades, and
propose engineering metrics that reflect real production goals: cost per
successful task (CPS), schema validity rate, executable call rate, p50/p95
latency, and energy per request. Guided decoding, strict JSON Schema outputs,
and validator-first tool execution close much of the capability gap with larger
models and often let SLMs match or surpass LLMs on tool use, function calling,
and RAG at 10x-100x lower token cost with materially better latency and energy.
We provide design patterns for agent stacks that prioritize SLMs: schema-first
prompting, type-safe function registries, confidence scoring with verifier
rollups, and lightweight adaptation via LoRA/QLoRA. We also delineate limits
where fallback remains valuable (open-domain reasoning and some long-horizon
planning). The result is a practical blueprint for building fast, inexpensive,
and reliable agents that default to SLMs while preserving headroom with
targeted LLM assistance.
  Keywords: small language models, agents, function calling, structured
outputs, JSON Schema, guided decoding, LoRA/QLoRA, routing, energy efficiency,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chrome集成Gemini Nano是浏览器AI能力的重要进步，但其受限的上下文窗口给处理大型输入带来挑战，需要解决方案来克服这一限制。

Method: 采用智能输入分块和处理策略，将大型内容分割成可管理的块，在浏览器约束下保持模型性能。

Result: 实现证明在处理大型文档和数据集方面特别有效，使复杂AI能力可通过浏览器直接访问，无需依赖外部API。

Conclusion: CAG架构成功解决了Gemini Nano在Chrome中的上下文窗口限制，为浏览器内AI处理大型内容提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present Chunked Augmented Generation (CAG), an architecture specifically
designed to overcome the context window limitations of Google Chrome's built-in
Gemini Nano model. While Chrome's integration of Gemini Nano represents a
significant advancement in bringing AI capabilities directly to the browser,
its restricted context window poses challenges for processing large inputs. CAG
addresses this limitation through intelligent input chunking and processing
strategies, enabling efficient handling of extensive content while maintaining

### [465] [Algorithm Generation via Creative Ideation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03851)
*Ruiying Ma,Chieh-Jan Mike Liang,Yanjie Gao,Francis Y. Yan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MetaMuse框架通过三个自反思原则解决LLM在算法生成中的创造性不足问题，在缓存替换和在线装箱问题上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统算法设计面临解空间不连续的挑战，导致工程师依赖通用启发式方法而牺牲性能。研究发现LLM在算法生成中存在偏向知名通用设计的偏见，缺乏创造性突破。

Method: 提出MetaMuse框架，基于三个自反思原则：(1)在可测量的性能空间而非抽象概念空间量化解决方案多样性和有用性；(2)通过外部刺激而非内部随机性引导构思；(3)使用路径点推理而非自由形式的思维链构建可执行解决方案。

Result: 在缓存替换问题上减少缓存未命中率高达35.76%，在在线装箱问题上减少容器使用量高达30.93%。

Conclusion: MetaMuse能够为全球云提供商的关键问题生成高性能解决方案，有效克服了LLM在算法生成中的创造性限制。

Abstract: Designing system algorithms remains challenging, where the discontinuous
nature of the solution space often forces system engineers to rely on generic
heuristics at the expense of performance. We study whether LLMs can practically
drive algorithm generation, and find that they are biased towards well-known
generic designs, rather than making the creative leaps needed to navigate the
discontinuous solution space. To address this limitation, we introduce
MetaMuse, a framework for creative ideation built on three self-reflection
principles: (1) quantifying solution diversity and usefulness in measurable
performance space, rather than abstract idea space, (2) steering ideation
through external stimuli, rather than internal randomness, and (3) constructing
executable solutions using waypoint reasoning, rather than free-form
chain-of-thought. Extensive evaluation shows that MetaMuse can generate
high-performing solutions for two critical problems at a global cloud provider:
cache replacement (reducing cache misses by up to 35.76%) and online bin
packing (reducing bin usage by up to 30.93%).

TL;DR: 提出了ECHO算法，通过层次化上下文表示、基于目标分析的评估和共识投票来改进LLM多智能体系统中的错误归因准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在分析复杂交互轨迹中的智能体和步骤级失败时，在准确性和一致性方面存在不足，需要更好的错误归因方法

Method: ECHO算法结合层次化上下文表示、基于目标分析的评估和共识投票机制，利用基于位置的层级化上下文理解，保持客观评估标准

Result: 实验结果表明ECHO在各种多智能体交互场景中优于现有方法，在涉及微妙推理错误和复杂依赖关系的案例中表现尤为突出

Conclusion: 结构化的层次化上下文表示与基于共识的客观决策相结合，为多智能体系统中的错误归因提供了更稳健的框架

Abstract: Error attribution in Large Language Model (LLM) multi-agent systems presents
a significant challenge in debugging and improving collaborative AI systems.
Current approaches to pinpointing agent and step level failures in interaction
traces - whether using all-at-once evaluation, step-by-step analysis, or binary
search - fall short when analyzing complex patterns, struggling with both
accuracy and consistency. We present ECHO (Error attribution through Contextual
Hierarchy and Objective consensus analysis), a novel algorithm that combines
hierarchical context representation, objective analysis-based evaluation, and
consensus voting to improve error attribution accuracy. Our approach leverages
a positional-based leveling of contextual understanding while maintaining
objective evaluation criteria, ultimately reaching conclusions through a
consensus mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO outperforms
existing methods across various multi-agent interaction scenarios, showing
particular strength in cases involving subtle reasoning errors and complex
interdependencies. Our findings suggest that leveraging these concepts of
structured, hierarchical context representation combined with consensus-based
objective decision-making, provides a more robust framework for error
attribution in multi-agent systems.

*Raghav Sharma,Manan Mehta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM和XAI代理的智能异常检测方法，用于关键IoT系统，在动态高维环境中提高检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法在复杂IoT系统（如智能医疗、能源电网）中面临动态高维数据、不完整数据和持续演变的挑战，需要自适应智能系统。

Method: 使用LLM支持的上下文推理方法和XAI代理，结合注意力机制、内存缓冲和语义分析来发现隐藏模式和数据不一致性。

Result: 在智能电网和医疗场景的模拟测试中，新方法在检测准确率、误报率、可解释性和响应速度方面显著优于传统模型。

Conclusion: LLM增强的方法在准确性和可解释性方面表现优异，适合未来IoT异常检测任务。

Abstract: Ensuring that critical IoT systems function safely and smoothly depends a lot
on finding anomalies quickly. As more complex systems, like smart healthcare,
energy grids and industrial automation, appear, it is easier to see the
shortcomings of older methods of detection. Monitoring failures usually happen
in dynamic, high dimensional situations, especially when data is incomplete,
messy or always evolving. Such limits point out the requirement for adaptive,
intelligent systems that always improve and think. LLMs are now capable of
significantly changing how context is understood and semantic inference is done
across all types of data. This proposal suggests using an LLM supported
contextual reasoning method along with XAI agents to improve how anomalies are
found in significant IoT environments. To discover hidden patterns and notice
inconsistencies in data streams, it uses attention methods, avoids dealing with
details from every time step and uses memory buffers with meaning. Because no
code AI stresses transparency and interpretability, people can check and accept
the AI's decisions, helping ensure AI follows company policies. The two
architectures are put together in a test that compares the results of the
traditional model with those of the suggested LLM enhanced model. Important
measures to check are the accuracy of detection, how much inaccurate
information is included in the results, how clearly the findings can be read
and how fast the system responds under different test situations. The
metaheuristic is tested in simulations of real world smart grid and healthcare
contexts to check its adaptability and reliability. From the study, we see that
the new approach performs much better than most existing models in both
accuracy and interpretation, so it could be a good fit for future anomaly
detection tasks in IoT

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Spatial CAPTCHA，一种基于空间推理能力差异的新型人机验证框架，相比传统基于文本识别或2D图像理解的CAPTCHA，能更有效防御多模态大语言模型的攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAPTCHA依赖文本识别或2D图像理解，但多模态大语言模型在这些任务上表现出色，导致现有验证机制失效，需要开发基于人类与AI在空间推理能力上根本差异的新方法。

Method: 采用程序化生成流水线，创建需要几何推理、视角转换、遮挡处理和心理旋转的动态问题，结合基于约束的难度控制、自动化正确性验证和人机协同验证。

Result: 在Spatial-CAPTCHA-Bench基准测试中，人类表现远超10个最先进的多模态大语言模型，最佳模型仅达到31.0%的Pass@1准确率，且优于Google reCAPTCHA。

Conclusion: Spatial CAPTCHA不仅作为有效的安全机制，还能作为AI空间推理能力的诊断工具，在防御自动化攻击方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: Online services rely on CAPTCHAs as a first line of defense against automated
abuse, yet recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have
eroded the effectiveness of conventional designs that focus on text recognition
or 2D image understanding. To address this challenge, we present Spatial
CAPTCHA, a novel human-verification framework that leverages fundamental
differences in spatial reasoning between humans and MLLMs. Unlike existing
CAPTCHAs which rely on low-level perception tasks that are vulnerable to modern
AI, Spatial CAPTCHA generates dynamic questions requiring geometric reasoning,
perspective-taking, occlusion handling, and mental rotation. These skills are
intuitive for humans but difficult for state-of-the-art (SOTA) AI systems. The
system employs a procedural generation pipeline with constraint-based
difficulty control, automated correctness verification, and human-in-the-loop
validation to ensure scalability, robustness, and adaptability. Evaluation on a
corresponding benchmark, Spatial-CAPTCHA-Bench, demonstrates that humans vastly
outperform 10 state-of-the-art MLLMs, with the best model achieving only 31.0%
Pass@1 accuracy. Furthermore, we compare Spatial CAPTCHA with Google reCAPTCHA,
which confirms its effectiveness as both a security mechanism and a diagnostic
tool for spatial reasoning in AI.

*Seil Kang,Woojung Han,Dayun Ju,Seong Jae Hwang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外训练、数据或外部模块的方法，通过在联合注意力块前扩大文本标记嵌入的表征空间，来增强多模态扩散变换器对罕见语义的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前先进的多模态扩散变换器在处理用户富有想象力或罕见的提示时仍然表现不佳，因为这些概念在预训练中过于稀缺，难以形成强表征。

Method: 在联合注意力机制前，通过数学方法扩大文本标记嵌入周围的表征空间，具体是通过方差放大的方式来实现。

Result: 该方法能有效在MM-DiT的输出中显现罕见语义，并在文本到图像、文本到视频和文本驱动的图像编辑等任务中具有良好泛化性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够揭示用户意图中原本隐藏的语义，为生成模型提供了更强大的语义表达能力。

Abstract: Starting from flow- and diffusion-based transformers, Multi-modal Diffusion
Transformers (MM-DiTs) have reshaped text-to-vision generation, gaining acclaim
for exceptional visual fidelity. As these models advance, users continually
push the boundary with imaginative or rare prompts, which advanced models still
falter in generating, since their concepts are often too scarce to leave a
strong imprint during pre-training. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective intervention that surfaces rare semantics inside MM-DiTs without
additional training steps, data, denoising-time optimization, or reliance on
external modules (e.g., large language models). In particular, the
joint-attention mechanism intrinsic to MM-DiT sequentially updates text
embeddings alongside image embeddings throughout transformer blocks. We find
that by mathematically expanding representational basins around text token
embeddings via variance scale-up before the joint-attention blocks, rare
semantics clearly emerge in MM-DiT's outputs. Furthermore, our results
generalize effectively across text-to-vision tasks, including text-to-image,
text-to-video, and text-driven image editing. Our work invites generative
models to reveal the semantics that users intend, once hidden yet ready to
surface.

TL;DR: 开发了一个游戏化的可解释AI系统，用于咖啡消费的道德决策，结合康德主义和功利主义推理，提供实时解释和元解释器来协调两种伦理框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决消费者在复杂供应链中做出道德决策的困难，通过可解释AI提供伦理指导，平衡不同伦理框架的冲突。

Method: 使用两个符号引擎：康德主义模块检测规则违反，功利主义模块通过多标准聚合评分；元解释器协调两者差异，在福利损失小时切换到符合义务论的选项。

Result: 发布了结构化配置、可审计的策略轨迹和交互式用户界面，系统能在伦理冲突时提供平衡的决策建议。

Conclusion: 该游戏化XAI系统成功整合了不同伦理框架，为消费者提供了透明、可解释的道德决策支持工具。

Abstract: We present a gamified explainable AI (XAI) system for ethically aware
consumer decision-making in the coffee domain. Each session comprises six
rounds with three options per round. Two symbolic engines provide real-time
reasons: a Kantian module flags rule violations (e.g., child labor,
deforestation risk without shade certification, opaque supply chains, unsafe
decaf), and a utilitarian module scores options via multi-criteria aggregation
over normalized attributes (price, carbon, water, transparency, farmer income
share, taste/freshness, packaging, convenience). A meta-explainer with a regret
bound (0.2) highlights Kantian--utilitarian (mis)alignment and switches to a
deontically clean, near-parity option when welfare loss is small. We release a
structured configuration (attribute schema, certification map, weights, rule
set), a policy trace for auditability, and an interactive UI.

TL;DR: QRLLM是一个用于评估大型语言模型在多轮对话中产生灾难性响应风险的认证框架，通过概率分布建模对话流程并提供统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法充分揭示LLMs在对话设置中的灾难性响应风险，因为它们依赖固定攻击提示序列、缺乏统计保证且无法扩展到多轮对话的广阔空间。

Method: 将多轮对话建模为查询序列的概率分布，使用马尔可夫过程在查询图上表示对话流程，通过置信区间量化灾难性风险，定义了随机节点、图路径、带拒绝的自适应等实用分布。

Result: 结果显示这些分布能够揭示前沿模型中的重大灾难性风险，最差模型的认证下界高达70%。

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs迫切需要改进安全训练策略，以应对多轮对话中存在的严重安全风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce catastrophic responses in
conversational settings that pose serious risks to public safety and security.
Existing evaluations often fail to fully reveal these vulnerabilities because
they rely on fixed attack prompt sequences, lack statistical guarantees, and do
not scale to the vast space of multi-turn conversations. In this work, we
propose QRLLM, a novel, principled Certification framework for Catastrophic
risks in multi-turn Conversation for LLMs that bounds the probability of an LLM
generating catastrophic responses under multi-turn conversation distributions
with statistical guarantees. We model multi-turn conversations as probability
distributions over query sequences, represented by a Markov process on a query
graph whose edges encode semantic similarity to capture realistic
conversational flow, and quantify catastrophic risks using confidence
intervals. We define several inexpensive and practical distributions: random
node, graph path, adaptive with rejection. Our results demonstrate that these
distributions can reveal substantial catastrophic risks in frontier models,
with certified lower bounds as high as 70\% for the worst model, highlighting
the urgent need for improved safety training strategies in frontier LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有创造力评估框架碎片化，缺乏理论基础，需要建立统一评估标准来衡量基础模型的创造力。

Method: 引入C^2-Eval基准，区分收敛性创造力（有约束解决方案）和发散性创造力（开放式任务），使用基于社会科学理论的细粒度标准进行评估。

Result: 通过对领先的专有和开源模型进行广泛实验，分析了它们在创造力能力上的权衡，揭示了当前基础模型在追求创造性机器智能方面的优势和挑战。

Conclusion: C^2-Eval是检验创造性AI发展格局的有效工具，能够全面评估基础模型的创造力表现。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of foundation models (FMs) has expanded their capabilities
far beyond conventional tasks. Creativity, long regarded as a hallmark of human
intelligence and a driver of innovation, is now increasingly recognized as a
critical dimension of machine intelligence in the era of generative FMs,
complementing traditional measures of accuracy. However, existing evaluation
frameworks for creativity remain fragmented, relying on ad hoc metrics not
firmly grounded in established theories. To address this gap, we introduce
C^2-Eval, a holistic benchmark for unified assessment of creativity in FMs.
C^2-Eval distinguishes between two complementary forms of creativity:
convergent creativity, where tasks admit constrained solutions (e.g., code
generation), and divergent creativity, where tasks are open-ended (e.g.,
storytelling). It evaluates both dimensions using fine-grained criteria derived
from social-science theory, focusing on Usefulness, Originality, and Surprise
(U-O-S). Through extensive experiments on leading proprietary and open-source
models, we analyze trade-offs in their creative capabilities. Our results
highlight both the strengths and challenges of current FMs in pursuing a
creative machine mind, showing that C^2-Eval is an effective lens for examining
the evolving landscape of creative AI.

Motivation: 基础天气模型缺乏语言推理能力，而大型语言模型无法处理高维气象数据，需要构建能够结合两者优势的智能框架来支持交互式科学工作流。

Method: 构建了ZephyrusWorld代码环境，包含WeatherBench 2数据集接口、自然语言地理查询、天气预报和气候模拟等工具，设计了多轮LLM天气代理Zephyrus，通过对话反馈循环迭代分析数据。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了天气模型和语言模型的优势，基准测试具有挑战性，为未来工作指明了方向。

Abstract: Foundation models for weather science are pre-trained on vast amounts of
structured numerical data and outperform traditional weather forecasting
systems. However, these models lack language-based reasoning capabilities,
limiting their utility in interactive scientific workflows. Large language
models (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating text but cannot reason
about high-dimensional meteorological datasets. We bridge this gap by building
a novel agentic framework for weather science. Our framework includes a Python
code-based environment for agents (ZephyrusWorld) to interact with weather
data, featuring tools like an interface to WeatherBench 2 dataset, geoquerying
for geographical masks from natural language, weather forecasting, and climate
simulation capabilities. We design Zephyrus, a multi-turn LLM-based weather
agent that iteratively analyzes weather datasets, observes results, and refines
its approach through conversational feedback loops. We accompany the agent with
a new benchmark, ZephyrusBench, with a scalable data generation pipeline that
constructs diverse question-answer pairs across weather-related tasks, from
basic lookups to advanced forecasting, extreme event detection, and
counterfactual reasoning. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the strong
performance of Zephyrus agents over text-only baselines, outperforming them by
up to 35 percentage points in correctness. However, on harder tasks, Zephyrus
performs similarly to text-only baselines, highlighting the challenging nature
of our benchmark and suggesting promising directions for future work.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
AI agents that automate multiple stages of the data science workflow by
integrating planning, tool use, and multimodal reasoning across text, code,
tables, and visuals. This survey presents the first comprehensive,
lifecycle-aligned taxonomy of data science agents, systematically analyzing and
mapping forty-five systems onto the six stages of the end-to-end data science
process: business understanding and data acquisition, exploratory analysis and
visualization, feature engineering, model building and selection,
interpretation and explanation, and deployment and monitoring. In addition to
lifecycle coverage, we annotate each agent along five cross-cutting design
dimensions: reasoning and planning style, modality integration, tool
orchestration depth, learning and alignment methods, and trust, safety, and
governance mechanisms. Beyond classification, we provide a critical synthesis
of agent capabilities, highlight strengths and limitations at each stage, and
review emerging benchmarks and evaluation practices. Our analysis identifies
three key trends: most systems emphasize exploratory analysis, visualization,
and modeling while neglecting business understanding, deployment, and
monitoring; multimodal reasoning and tool orchestration remain unresolved
challenges; and over 90% lack explicit trust and safety mechanisms. We conclude
by outlining open challenges in alignment stability, explainability,
governance, and robust evaluation frameworks, and propose future research
directions to guide the development of robust, trustworthy, low-latency,
transparent, and broadly accessible data science agents.

TL;DR: 提出MedLog协议，用于记录临床AI系统的事件级日志，类似于计算机系统中的syslog，旨在提高医疗AI的透明度和可观测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域缺乏标准化的AI使用记录协议，难以追踪AI模型的使用情况、性能表现和潜在风险，阻碍了真实世界性能评估、不良事件检测和偏差纠正。

Method: 设计包含9个核心字段的MedLog记录格式：header、model、user、target、inputs、artifacts、outputs、outcomes、feedback，支持风险采样、生命周期感知的保留策略和写后缓存机制。

Result: MedLog协议能够结构化记录临床AI活动，支持复杂工作流的详细追踪，为医疗AI的持续监测、审计和迭代改进提供基础。

Conclusion: MedLog协议有望推动医疗AI的透明化发展，建立新型数字流行病学基础，通过标准化日志记录实现医疗AI系统的有效监管和持续优化。

Abstract: Modern computer systems often rely on syslog, a simple, universal protocol
that records every critical event across heterogeneous infrastructure. However,
healthcare's rapidly growing clinical AI stack has no equivalent. As hospitals
rush to pilot large language models and other AI-based clinical decision
support tools, we still lack a standard way to record how, when, by whom, and
for whom these AI models are used. Without that transparency and visibility, it
is challenging to measure real-world performance and outcomes, detect adverse
events, or correct bias or dataset drift. In the spirit of syslog, we introduce
MedLog, a protocol for event-level logging of clinical AI. Any time an AI model
is invoked to interact with a human, interface with another algorithm, or act
independently, a MedLog record is created. This record consists of nine core
fields: header, model, user, target, inputs, artifacts, outputs, outcomes, and
feedback, providing a structured and consistent record of model activity. To
encourage early adoption, especially in low-resource settings, and minimize the
data footprint, MedLog supports risk-based sampling, lifecycle-aware retention
policies, and write-behind caching; detailed traces for complex, agentic, or
multi-stage workflows can also be captured under MedLog. MedLog can catalyze
the development of new databases and software to store and analyze MedLog
records. Realizing this vision would enable continuous surveillance, auditing,
and iterative improvement of medical AI, laying the foundation for a new form
of digital epidemiology.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了FaithCoT-Bench基准，用于检测LLM中思维链(CoT)的不忠实性，包含1000+轨迹和300+不忠实实例，评估了11种检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究显示思维链往往不能忠实反映模型的内部推理过程，但在实例层面判断特定轨迹是否忠实仍是一个未解决的实际挑战。

Method: 建立统一的基准框架，将不忠实性检测定义为判别决策问题，提供FINE-CoT数据集（包含1000+轨迹和300+不忠实实例），系统评估11种代表性检测方法。

Result: 评估揭示了现有方法的优缺点，发现在知识密集型领域和更先进模型中检测挑战更大。

Conclusion: FaithCoT-Bench是首个全面的实例级CoT忠实性基准，为未来研究更可解释和可信的LLM推理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting to improve problem-solving and provide seemingly transparent
explanations. However, growing evidence shows that CoT often fail to faithfully
represent the underlying reasoning process, raising concerns about their
reliability in high-risk applications. Although prior studies have focused on
mechanism-level analyses showing that CoTs can be unfaithful, they leave open
the practical challenge of deciding whether a specific trajectory is faithful
to the internal reasoning of the model. To address this gap, we introduce
FaithCoT-Bench, a unified benchmark for instance-level CoT unfaithfulness
detection. Our framework establishes a rigorous task formulation that
formulates unfaithfulness detection as a discriminative decision problem, and
provides FINE-CoT (Faithfulness instance evaluation for Chain-of-Thought), an
expert-annotated collection of over 1,000 trajectories generated by four
representative LLMs across four domains, including more than 300 unfaithful
instances with fine-grained causes and step-level evidence. We further conduct
a systematic evaluation of eleven representative detection methods spanning
counterfactual, logit-based, and LLM-as-judge paradigms, deriving empirical
insights that clarify the strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches and
reveal the increased challenges of detection in knowledge-intensive domains and
with more advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, FaithCoT-Bench
establishes the first comprehensive benchmark for instance-level CoT
faithfulness, setting a solid basis for future research toward more
interpretable and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite huge advances, LLMs still lack convenient and reliable methods to
quantify the uncertainty in their responses, making them difficult to trust in
high-stakes applications. One of the simplest approaches to eliciting more
accurate answers is to select the mode of many responses, a technique known as
ensembling. In this work, we expand on typical ensembling approaches by looking
at ensembles with a variable voting threshold. We introduce a theoretical
framework for question answering and show that, by permitting ensembles to
"abstain" from providing an answer when the dominant response falls short of
the threshold, it is possible to dramatically increase the trustworthiness of
the remaining answers. From this framework, we derive theoretical results as
well as report experimental results on two problem domains: arithmetic problem
solving and clinical-note question-answering. In both domains, we observe that
large gains in answer trustworthiness can be achieved using highly restrictive
voting ensembles, while incurring relatively modest reductions in response
yield and accuracy. Due to this quality, voting ensembles may be particularly
useful in applications - such as healthcare and data annotation - that require
a high degree of certainty but which may not require that every question
receive an automated answer.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LEGO-IRT是一个用于高效评估大语言模型的统一框架，支持二元和连续评分指标，通过因子化架构利用结构知识，仅需3%的评估项目即可获得稳定的能力估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大语言模型评估方法计算成本高昂，而现有的基于项目反应理论的方法存在局限：仅支持二元正确性指标，无法处理生成任务的连续分数，且忽略跨指标或基准的结构知识。

Method: 提出LEGO-IRT框架，支持二元和连续评估指标，采用因子化架构将模型能力估计分解为通用组件和特定结构组件（如按指标或基准），显式建模和利用结构知识。

Result: 在涉及70个LLM和5个基准的实验表明，LEGO-IRT仅使用3%的总评估项目即可获得稳定的能力估计，整合结构知识可将估计误差降低高达10%，其潜在能力估计更符合人类偏好。

Conclusion: LEGO-IRT为数据高效的大语言模型评估提供了一个灵活统一的框架，显著降低了评估成本，同时提高了估计精度和对齐人类偏好的能力。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on comprehensive benchmarks is a
cornerstone of their development, yet it's often computationally and
financially prohibitive. While Item Response Theory (IRT) offers a promising
path toward data-efficient evaluation by disentangling model capability from
item difficulty, existing IRT-based methods are hampered by significant
limitations. They are typically restricted to binary correctness metrics,
failing to natively handle the continuous scores used in generative tasks, and
they operate on single benchmarks, ignoring valuable structural knowledge like
correlations across different metrics or benchmarks. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce LEGO-IRT, a unified and flexible framework for
data-efficient LLM evaluation. LEGO-IRT's novel design natively supports both
binary and continuous evaluation metrics. Moreover, it introduces a factorized
architecture to explicitly model and leverage structural knowledge, decomposing
model ability estimates into a general component and structure-specific (e.g.,
per-metric or per-benchmark) components. Through extensive experiments
involving $70$ LLMs across $5$ benchmarks, we show that LEGO-IRT achieves
stable capability estimates using just $3\%$ of the total evaluation items. We
demonstrate that incorporating structural knowledge reduces estimation error by
up to $10\%$ and reveal that the latent abilities estimated by our framework
may align more closely with human preferences.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型内部的情感表征机制，发现LLMs在神经网络中形成了清晰的情感几何结构，这种结构随模型规模增强，且情感信号在网络中层达到峰值，具有可塑性和持久性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然研究证实LLMs能够模拟情感智能，但其内部的情感机制仍未被充分探索。本文旨在探究现代LLMs中潜在的情感表征，包括情感如何、在何处以及持续多长时间被编码在神经网络架构中。

Method: 构建了一个包含约40万条话语的大规模Reddit语料库，通过分类、重写和合成生成平衡了七种基本情感。使用轻量级"探针"从各种Qwen3和LLaMA模型的隐藏层读取信息，而不改变其参数。

Result: 发现LLMs形成了定义良好的内部情感几何结构，这种结构随模型规模增强，显著优于零样本提示。情感信号不是最终层现象，而是在网络早期出现并在中层达到峰值。内部状态具有可塑性（可通过简单系统提示影响）和持久性（初始情感基调可在数百个后续token中检测到）。

Conclusion: 贡献了数据集、开源探针工具包和LLMs内部情感景观的详细图谱，为开发更透明和对齐的AI系统提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to navigate the
nuances of human emotion. While research confirms that LLMs can simulate
emotional intelligence, their internal emotional mechanisms remain largely
unexplored. This paper investigates the latent emotional representations within
modern LLMs by asking: how, where, and for how long is emotion encoded in their
neural architecture? To address this, we introduce a novel, large-scale Reddit
corpus of approximately 400,000 utterances, balanced across seven basic
emotions through a multi-stage process of classification, rewriting, and
synthetic generation. Using this dataset, we employ lightweight "probes" to
read out information from the hidden layers of various Qwen3 and LLaMA models
without altering their parameters. Our findings reveal that LLMs develop a
surprisingly well-defined internal geometry of emotion, which sharpens with
model scale and significantly outperforms zero-shot prompting. We demonstrate
that this emotional signal is not a final-layer phenomenon but emerges early
and peaks mid-network. Furthermore, the internal states are both malleable
(they can be influenced by simple system prompts) and persistent, as the
initial emotional tone remains detectable for hundreds of subsequent tokens. We
contribute our dataset, an open-source probing toolkit, and a detailed map of
the emotional landscape within LLMs, offering crucial insights for developing
more transparent and aligned AI systems. The code and dataset are open-sourced.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了道德锚系统（MAS），这是一个用于检测、预测和减轻AI代理价值漂移的新框架，结合了实时贝叶斯推理、LSTM网络预测和人类中心治理层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI作为超级能力助手的崛起，确保AI行为与人类伦理和意图保持一致变得至关重要。关键风险是价值漂移，即AI系统因环境变化、学习动态或意外优化而偏离对齐价值观，可能导致效率低下或伦理违规。

Method: MAS结合实时贝叶斯推理监控价值状态、LSTM网络预测漂移趋势，以及人类中心治理层进行自适应干预。强调低延迟响应（<20毫秒）以防止违规，并通过监督微调减少误报和警报疲劳。

Result: 在模拟实验中，MAS能够将价值漂移事件减少80%以上，保持高检测准确率（85%）和低误报率（0.08%）。严格的实验验证了MAS的可扩展性和响应性。

Conclusion: MAS的创新性在于其预测性和自适应特性，与静态对齐方法形成对比。贡献包括MAS架构设计、强调速度和可用性的实证结果、跨领域适用性见解以及开源代码。

Abstract: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) as super-capable assistants has
transformed productivity and decision-making across domains. Yet, this
integration raises critical concerns about value alignment - ensuring AI
behaviors remain consistent with human ethics and intentions. A key risk is
value drift, where AI systems deviate from aligned values due to evolving
contexts, learning dynamics, or unintended optimizations, potentially leading
to inefficiencies or ethical breaches. We propose the Moral Anchor System
(MAS), a novel framework to detect, predict, and mitigate value drift in AI
agents. MAS combines real-time Bayesian inference for monitoring value states,
LSTM networks for forecasting drift, and a human-centric governance layer for
adaptive interventions. It emphasizes low-latency responses (<20 ms) to prevent
breaches, while reducing false positives and alert fatigue via supervised
fine-tuning with human feedback. Our hypothesis: integrating probabilistic
drift detection, predictive analytics, and adaptive governance can reduce value
drift incidents by 80 percent or more in simulations, maintaining high
detection accuracy (85 percent) and low false positive rates (0.08
post-adaptation). Rigorous experiments with goal-misaligned agents validate
MAS's scalability and responsiveness. MAS's originality lies in its predictive
and adaptive nature, contrasting static alignment methods. Contributions
include: (1) MAS architecture for AI integration; (2) empirical results
prioritizing speed and usability; (3) cross-domain applicability insights; and
(4) open-source code for replication.

TL;DR: SPOGW是一种基于分数偏好的新方法，通过组间比较直接在连续空间中进行优化，解决了现有离散优化技术在表示能力、适应性、可扩展性和成对比较范式方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前设计LLM代理工作流需要大量人工努力，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。现有自动化方法受限于离散优化技术，存在表示能力有限、适应性不足、可扩展性弱和成对比较范式等问题。

Method: SPOGW采用基于分数偏好的方法，结合迭代离线GRPO（ioGRPO）和优势掩码KL散度（mKL），通过组间比较在连续空间中进行更高效稳定的优化，重点关注策略响应的优势区域。

Result: 在五个基准数据集（数学推理、编程和问答）上，SPOGW达到或超过了当前最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: SPOGW为自动化生成和优化代理工作流提供了一种可行且前瞻的方法论。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant capabilities in
addressing challenging problems throughout various fields, often through the
use of agentic workflows that adhere to structured instructions and multi-step
procedures. However, designing such workflows demands substantial manual
effort, posing challenges to scalability and generalizability. Recent studies
have aimed to minimize the human intervention needed for their construction,
leading to advances in automated techniques for optimizing agentic workflows.
However, current approaches are often constrained by their limited
representational capacity, insufficient adaptability, weak scalability, and
pairwise comparison paradigm -- issues that stem primarily from a dependence on
discrete optimization techniques. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a
new score-based preference approach, refereed as SPOGW, which operates directly
on cardinal reward signals through group-wise comparison and enables more
efficient and stable optimization in a continuous space. SPOGW incorporates
Iterative offline GRPO (ioGRPO) with advantage-masked KL divergence (mKL),
which regulates training update by placing greater emphasis on the advantageous
regions of the policy response. In five benchmark datasets covering
mathematical reasoning, coding, and question answering, SPOGW matches or
exceeds the performance of current state-of-the-art approaches, presenting a
viable and forward-looking methodology for automated generation and
optimization of agentic workflows.

TL;DR: DLLM是一个基于扩散模型的LLM框架，用于网络教育系统中的噪声鲁棒认知诊断，通过构建独立子图、关系增强对齐和两阶段去噪扩散模块来解决数据不平衡和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络教育系统(WIES)中的认知诊断面临异构噪声交互、数据不平衡和LLM对结构化数据处理困难等挑战，特别是在开放环境中新学生不断加入产生大量响应日志，加剧了这些问题。

Method: DLLM首先基于响应正确性构建独立子图，应用关系增强对齐缓解数据不平衡；然后融合子图表示并与LLM语义增强表示对齐；采用两阶段去噪扩散模块（无条件去噪和基于图引导的条件去噪）消除内在噪声并辅助结构表示对齐。

Result: 在三个公开网络教育平台数据集上的实验表明，DLLM在不同噪声水平下均实现最优预测性能，证明了其在有效利用LLM语义知识的同时实现噪声鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DLLM通过结合扩散模型和LLM，成功解决了网络教育系统中认知诊断的噪声鲁棒性问题，为处理异构噪声数据提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cognitive diagnostics in the Web-based Intelligent Education System (WIES)
aims to assess students' mastery of knowledge concepts from heterogeneous,
noisy interactions. Recent work has tried to utilize Large Language Models
(LLMs) for cognitive diagnosis, yet LLMs struggle with structured data and are
prone to noise-induced misjudgments. Specially, WIES's open environment
continuously attracts new students and produces vast amounts of response logs,
exacerbating the data imbalance and noise issues inherent in traditional
educational systems. To address these challenges, we propose DLLM, a
Diffusion-based LLM framework for noise-robust cognitive diagnosis. DLLM first
constructs independent subgraphs based on response correctness, then applies
relation augmentation alignment module to mitigate data imbalance. The two
subgraph representations are then fused and aligned with LLM-derived,
semantically augmented representations. Importantly, before each alignment
step, DLLM employs a two-stage denoising diffusion module to eliminate
intrinsic noise while assisting structural representation alignment.
Specifically, unconditional denoising diffusion first removes erroneous
information, followed by conditional denoising diffusion based on graph-guided
to eliminate misleading information. Finally, the noise-robust representation
that integrates semantic knowledge and structural information is fed into
existing cognitive diagnosis models for prediction. Experimental results on
three publicly available web-based educational platform datasets demonstrate
that our DLLM achieves optimal predictive performance across varying noise
levels, which demonstrates that DLLM achieves noise robustness while
effectively leveraging semantic knowledge from LLM.

Result: ALISA方法在多个指标上达到最先进水平，显著提升了生成性能。

Conclusion: WebRenderBench提供了更真实多样的评估基准，ALISA通过集成渲染质量评估有效提升了UI代码生成质量。

Abstract: Automating the conversion of UI images into web code is a critical task for
front-end development and rapid prototyping. Advances in multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) have made WebUI-to-Code increasingly feasible, yet
existing benchmarks remain limited in data diversity and evaluation
reliability. To address these issues, we present WebRenderBench, a large-scale
benchmark of 22.5k webpages collected from real-world portal sites, offering
greater diversity, complexity, and realism than prior benchmarks. We further
propose a novel evaluation metric that measures layout and style consistency
from the final rendered pages. Unlike vision-based methods that rely on costly
LLM reasoning or structure-based comparisons vulnerable to noise and asymmetry,
our approach enables more efficient, objective, and reliable UI quality
assessment. Finally, we introduce the Automated Layout and Style Inspection
Agent (ALISA), which integrates this metric into reinforcement learning as a
reward signal to enhance training on crawled asymmetric webpages. Experiments
show that ALISA significantly boosts generation performance, achieving
state-of-the-art results across multiple metrics.

Method: 提出AutoMR框架，基于有向无环图表示元推理骨架，构建搜索空间，并设计动态骨架采样算法，在推理时根据上下文动态扩展骨架。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，AutoMR相比先前工作取得了更好的推理性能。

Conclusion: AutoMR能够自动搜索查询感知的元推理骨架，有效提升大语言模型的推理能力，解决了手动设计骨架的局限性。

Abstract: Meta reasoning behaviors work as a skeleton to guide large language model
(LLM) reasoning, thus help to improve reasoning performance. However, prior
researches implement meta reasoning skeleton with manually designed structure,
limiting ability to adapt to query-specific requirement and capture intricate
logical dependency among reasoning steps. To deal with the challenges, we
represent meta reasoning skeleton with directed acyclic graph (DAG) to unify
skeletons proposed in prior works and model intricate logical dependency. Then
we propose AutoMR, a framework that searches for query-aware meta reasoning
skeleton automatically inspired by automated machine learning (AutoML).
Specifically, we construct search space based on DAG representation of skeleton
and then formulate the search problem. We design a dynamic skeleton sampling
algorithm by expanding meta reasoning skeleton along with reasoning context at
inference time. This algorithm can derive any meta reasoning skeleton in search
space efficiently and adapt skeleton to evolving base reasoning context, thus
enable efficient query-aware skeleton search. We conduct experiments on
extensive benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that AutoMR achieves
better reasoning performance than previous works broadly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解为什么模型会决定进行推理行为，特别是等待标记背后的机制，这有助于揭示推理模型有效性的本质原因。

Method: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B模型的多层训练交叉编码器，引入潜在归因技术，识别影响等待标记概率的特征集。

Result: 定位到一小部分能够促进/抑制等待标记概率的特征，这些特征确实与推理过程相关，并产生不同的推理模式。

Conclusion: 模型潜在特征包含调控后续推理过程的相关信息，这些特征能够驱动不同类型的推理行为，如重新开始、回忆先验知识、表达不确定性和双重检查等。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that a significant driver of performance in reasoning
models is their ability to reason and self-correct. A distinctive marker in
these reasoning traces is the token wait, which often signals reasoning
behavior such as backtracking. Despite being such a complex behavior, little is
understood of exactly why models do or do not decide to reason in this
particular manner, which limits our understanding of what makes a reasoning
model so effective. In this work, we address the question whether model's
latents preceding wait tokens contain relevant information for modulating the
subsequent reasoning process. We train crosscoders at multiple layers of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B and its base version, and introduce a latent
attribution technique in the crosscoder setting. We locate a small set of
features relevant for promoting/suppressing wait tokens' probabilities.
Finally, through a targeted series of experiments analyzing max activating
examples and causal interventions, we show that many of our identified features
indeed are relevant for the reasoning process and give rise to different types
of reasoning patterns such as restarting from the beginning, recalling prior
knowledge, expressing uncertainty, and double-checking.

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法依赖基础模型能力，需要高质量探索（有效性和多样性），但现有方法通过模仿专家轨迹只提升了有效性而忽视了多样性。

Method: MENTOR框架在关键决策点提供专家指导，进行混合策略专家导航，实现令牌级推理优化，促进有效且多样化的探索。

Result: 实验表明MENTOR能够捕捉专家策略的本质而非表面模仿，实现高质量探索并获得优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: 只在关键决策点提供专家指导比完整路径模仿更有效，MENTOR框架通过这种方式提升了RLVR的探索质量和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a widely
adopted technique for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RLVR strongly depends on the capability
of base models. This issue arises because it requires the model to have
sufficient capability to perform high-quality exploration, which involves both
effectiveness and diversity. Unfortunately, existing methods address this issue
by imitating expert trajectories, which improve effectiveness but neglect
diversity. To address this, we argue that the expert only needs to provide
guidance only at critical decision points rather than the entire reasoning
path. Based on this insight, we propose MENTOR: Mixed-policy Expert Navigation
for Token-level Optimization of Reasoning, a framework that provides expert
guidance only at critical decision points to perform effective and diverse
exploration in RLVR. Extensive experiments show that MENTOR enables models
capture the essence of expert strategies rather than surface imitation, thereby
performing high-quality exploration and achieving superior overall performance.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This survey paper chronicles the evolution of evaluation in multimodal
artificial intelligence (AI), framing it as a progression of increasingly
sophisticated "cognitive examinations." We argue that the field is undergoing a
paradigm shift, moving from simple recognition tasks that test "what" a model
sees, to complex reasoning benchmarks that probe "why" and "how" it
understands. This evolution is driven by the saturation of older benchmarks,
where high performance often masks fundamental weaknesses. We chart the journey
from the foundational "knowledge tests" of the ImageNet era to the "applied
logic and comprehension" exams such as GQA and Visual Commonsense Reasoning
(VCR), which were designed specifically to diagnose systemic flaws such as
shortcut learning and failures in compositional generalization. We then survey
the current frontier of "expert-level integration" benchmarks (e.g., MMBench,
SEED-Bench, MMMU) designed for today's powerful multimodal large language
models (MLLMs), which increasingly evaluate the reasoning process itself.
Finally, we explore the uncharted territories of evaluating abstract, creative,
and social intelligence. We conclude that the narrative of AI evaluation is not
merely a history of datasets, but a continuous, adversarial process of
designing better examinations that, in turn, redefine our goals for creating
truly intelligent systems.

Conclusion: Agent Spec 提供了技术基础，促进AI智能体开发的标准化、互操作性和可重用性，未来将继续发展完善。

Abstract: Open Agent Specification (Agent Spec) is a declarative language that allows
AI agents and their workflows to be defined in a way that is compatible across
different AI frameworks, promoting portability and interoperability within AI
Agent frameworks.
  Agent Spec aims to resolve the challenges of fragmented agent development by
providing a common unified specification that allows AI agents to be designed
once and deployed across various frameworks, improving interoperability and
reusability, and reducing redundant development efforts. Additionally, Agent
Spec facilitates development tools and portability, allowing AI agents to be
defined independently of their execution environment and enabling teams to
exchange solutions without implementation-specific limitations.
  Agent Spec benefits four key groups: (i) Agent developers, who gain access to
a superset of reusable components and design patterns, enabling them to
leverage a broader range of functionalities; (ii) Agent framework and tool
developers, who can use Agent Spec as an interchange format and therefore
benefit from the support of other frameworks as well as other tools; (iii)
Researchers, who can achieve reproducible results and comparability,
facilitating more reliable and consistent outcomes; (iv) Enterprises, which
benefit from faster prototype-to-deployment, increased productivity, as well as
greater scalability and maintainability for their AI agent solutions. This
technical report provides an overview of the technical foundations of Agent
Spec, including motivation, benefits, and future developments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于LLM的增量地图构建与修复框架，通过版本控制和边影响评分来检测、定位和修正导航图中的结构不一致性，显著提升地图正确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着环境规模扩大，基于上下文依赖的查询方法变得不可行，需要增量式地图构建来从逐步观察中构建完整拓扑图。

Method: 采用版本控制记录图编辑历史及其来源观察，实现细粒度回滚、冲突追踪和修复评估；引入边影响评分基于结构可达性、路径使用和冲突传播来优先最小成本修复。

Result: 在清理后的MANGO基准数据集上显著提高了地图正确性和鲁棒性，特别是在存在纠缠或链式不一致性的场景中。

Conclusion: 结果表明内省式、历史感知的修复机制对于维护LLM智能体连贯空间记忆的重要性。

Abstract: Given a map description through global traversal navigation instructions
(e.g., visiting each room sequentially with action signals such as north, west,
etc.), an LLM can often infer the implicit spatial layout of the environment
and answer user queries by providing a shortest path from a start to a
destination (for instance, navigating from the lobby to a meeting room via the
hall and elevator). However, such context-dependent querying becomes incapable
as the environment grows much longer, motivating the need for incremental map
construction that builds a complete topological graph from stepwise
observations. We propose a framework for LLM-driven construction and map
repair, designed to detect, localize, and correct structural inconsistencies in
incrementally constructed navigation graphs. Central to our method is the
Version Control, which records the full history of graph edits and their source
observations, enabling fine-grained rollback, conflict tracing, and repair
evaluation. We further introduce an Edge Impact Score to prioritize
minimal-cost repairs based on structural reachability, path usage, and conflict
propagation. To properly evaluate our approach, we create a refined version of
the MANGO benchmark dataset by systematically removing non-topological actions
and inherent structural conflicts, providing a cleaner testbed for LLM-driven
construction and map repair. Our approach significantly improves map
correctness and robustness, especially in scenarios with entangled or chained
inconsistencies. Our results highlight the importance of introspective,
history-aware repair mechanisms for maintaining coherent spatial memory in LLM
agents.

TL;DR: COSMO-RL是一个混合强化学习框架，用于训练多模态推理模型，通过多任务多目标信号同时提升安全性和能力，并发布了COSMO-R1模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态推理模型在真实应用中需要兼顾实用性和安全性，但多模态环境下的安全性特别具有挑战性：图像和文本组合可能绕过防护机制，单目标训练可能导致策略漂移，造成良性输入过度拒绝或危险输入不安全合规。

Method: 提出COSMO-RL混合强化学习框架，在多模态、多任务和多目标信号下训练推理导向的大型多模态推理模型。

Result: COSMO-R1在提升安全性的同时保持并经常改善多模态推理和指令跟随能力，对多模态越狱攻击表现出更强的鲁棒性，并减少了不必要的拒绝。该框架在不同骨干网络上都能获得一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 消融实验支持了设计选择，表明这是在大理多模态推理模型中同时推进安全性和通用能力的简单路径。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Reasoning Models (LMRMs) are moving into real applications,
where they must be both useful and safe. Safety is especially challenging in
multimodal settings: images and text can be combined to bypass guardrails, and
single objective training can cause policy drift that yields over-refusal on
benign inputs or unsafe compliance on risky ones. We present COSMO-RL, a mixed
reinforcement learning framework that trains reasoning oriented LMRMs under
multimodal, multitask, and multiobjective signals, and we release the resulting
model, COSMO-R1. Our approach aims to let safety and capability grow together
in one stable pipeline rather than competing during alignment. In experiments,
COSMO-R1 improves safety while maintaining-and often improving multimodal
reasoning and instruction following, shows stronger robustness to multimodal
jailbreaks, and reduces unnecessary refusals. The framework also transfers
across backbones with consistent gains. Ablations support the design choices,
indicating a simple path to advancing safety and general capability together in
LMRMs.

TL;DR: AgentRL是一个用于可扩展多轮多任务智能体强化学习的框架，通过异步生成-训练流水线和算法创新，在多个智能体任务上显著超越现有LLM智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏可扩展的基础设施和稳定的训练算法，在LLM智能体中应用强化学习在多轮多任务设置中仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 基础设施方面：完全异步的生成-训练流水线、基于函数调用的统一API接口、容器化环境开发和集中式控制器。算法方面：跨策略采样鼓励多轮探索，任务优势归一化稳定多任务训练。

Result: 在五个智能体任务上训练的开源LLM显著超越GPT-5、Clause-Sonnet-4、DeepSeek-R1等模型。多任务训练结果与所有任务专用模型的最佳结果相当。

Conclusion: AgentRL框架成功解决了多轮多任务智能体强化学习的挑战，提供了可扩展的基础设施和稳定的训练算法，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest
in building generalist agents that can learn through online interactions.
However, applying reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLM agents in
multi-turn, multi-task settings remains challenging due to lack of scalable
infrastructure and stable training algorithms. In this work, we present the
AgentRL framework for scalable multi-turn, multi-task agentic RL training. On
the infrastructure side, AgentRL features a fully-asynchronous
generation-training pipeline for efficient multi-turn RL. To support
heterogeneous environment development in multi-task RL, we design a unified
function-call based API interface, containerized environment development, and a
centralized controller. On the algorithm side, we propose cross-policy sampling
to encourage model exploration in multi-turn settings and task advantage
normalization to stabilize multi-task training. Experiments show that AgentRL,
trained on open LLMs across five agentic tasks, significantly outperforms
GPT-5, Clause-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-R1, and other open-source LLM agents.
Multi-task training with AgentRL matches the best results among all
task-specific models. AgentRL is open-sourced at
https://github.com/THUDM/AgentRL. The algorithm and framework are adopted in
building \textsc{\href{https://autoglm.zhipuai.cn}{AutoGLM}}.

*Mohsen Hariri,Amirhossein Samandar,Michael Hinczewski,Vipin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个贝叶斯评估框架来替代Pass@k，通过后验估计模型成功概率和可信区间，提供更稳定的模型排名和透明的差异决策规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pass@k在有限试验次数和计算受限时会产生不稳定、误导性的模型排名，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 使用狄利克雷先验的贝叶斯框架，将评估结果建模为分类变量，提供后验均值和不确定性的闭式表达式，支持加权评分标准和先验证据的使用。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，贝叶斯方法比Pass@k及其变体收敛更快、排名更稳定，能在更少样本下实现可靠比较。

Conclusion: 推荐用基于后验的贝叶斯框架替代Pass@k，它统一了二元和非二元评估，明确量化不确定性，计算效率更高。

Abstract: Pass$@k$ is widely used to report performance for LLM reasoning, but it often
yields unstable, misleading rankings, especially when the number of trials
(samples) is limited and compute is constrained. We present a principled
Bayesian evaluation framework that replaces Pass$@k$ and average accuracy over
$N$ trials (avg$@N$) with posterior estimates of a model's underlying success
probability and credible intervals, yielding stable rankings and a transparent
decision rule for differences. Evaluation outcomes are modeled as categorical
(not just 0/1) with a Dirichlet prior, giving closed-form expressions for the
posterior mean and uncertainty of any weighted rubric and enabling the use of
prior evidence when appropriate. Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the
Bayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$),
explaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty.
Empirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on
AIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster
convergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants,
enabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts. The framework
clarifies when observed gaps are statistically meaningful (non-overlapping
credible intervals) versus noise, and it naturally extends to graded,
rubric-based evaluations. Together, these results recommend replacing Pass$@k$
for LLM evaluation and ranking with a posterior-based, compute-efficient
protocol that unifies binary and non-binary evaluation while making uncertainty
explicit. Code is available at https://mohsenhariri.github.io/bayes-kit

Result: 广泛的仿真实验表明，所提出的方法相对于孤岛决策框架显著提高了盈利能力，训练后的RL智能体行为与理论模型的管理洞察高度一致。

Conclusion: 这项工作为复杂商业环境中实现有效的跨职能协调提供了一个可扩展、可解释的基于RL的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective cross-functional coordination is essential for enhancing firm-wide
profitability, particularly in the face of growing organizational complexity
and scale. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, especially in
reinforcement learning (RL), offer promising avenues to address this
fundamental challenge. This paper proposes a unified multi-agent RL framework
tailored for joint optimization across distinct functional modules, exemplified
via coordinating inventory replenishment and personalized product
recommendation. We first develop an integrated theoretical model to capture the
intricate interplay between these functions and derive analytical benchmarks
that characterize optimal coordination. The analysis reveals synchronized
adjustment patterns across products and over time, highlighting the importance
of coordinated decision-making. Leveraging these insights, we design a novel
multi-timescale multi-agent RL architecture that decomposes policy components
according to departmental functions and assigns distinct learning speeds based
on task complexity and responsiveness. Our model-free multi-agent design
improves scalability and deployment flexibility, while multi-timescale updates
enhance convergence stability and adaptability across heterogeneous decisions.
We further establish the asymptotic convergence of the proposed algorithm.
Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach
significantly improves profitability relative to siloed decision-making
frameworks, while the behaviors of the trained RL agents align closely with the
managerial insights from our theoretical model. Taken together, this work
provides a scalable, interpretable RL-based solution to enable effective
cross-functional coordination in complex business settings.

TL;DR: GROK是一个基于多模态大语言模型的眼科诊断系统，通过联合处理彩色眼底照相、光学相干断层扫描和文本数据，提供临床级别的眼部和全身疾病诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医学多模态大模型如LLaVA-Med未能充分利用彩色眼底照相和光学相干断层扫描之间的协同作用，且对定量生物标志物的可解释性有限。

Method: GROK包含三个核心模块：知识引导指令生成、CLIP风格OCT生物标志物对齐和监督指令微调，建立了定量到定性的诊断思维链。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用LoRA微调7B参数的Qwen2骨干网络，GROK在报告质量和细粒度临床指标上均优于可比较的7B和32B基线模型，甚至超过了OpenAI o3。

Conclusion: GROK通过建立定量到定性的诊断思维链，成功实现了临床级别的眼科诊断，代码和数据已在GROK仓库中公开。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) hold promise for integrating diverse
data modalities, but current medical adaptations such as LLaVA-Med often fail
to fully exploit the synergy between color fundus photography (CFP) and optical
coherence tomography (OCT), and offer limited interpretability of quantitative
biomarkers. We introduce GROK, a grounded multimodal large language model that
jointly processes CFP, OCT, and text to deliver clinician-grade diagnoses of
ocular and systemic disease. GROK comprises three core modules:
Knowledge-Guided Instruction Generation, CLIP-Style OCT-Biomarker Alignment,
and Supervised Instruction Fine-Tuning, which together establish a
quantitative-to-qualitative diagnostic chain of thought, mirroring real
clinical reasoning when producing detailed lesion annotations. To evaluate our
approach, we introduce the Grounded Ophthalmic Understanding benchmark, which
covers six disease categories and three tasks: macro-level diagnostic
classification, report generation quality, and fine-grained clinical assessment
of the generated chain of thought. Experiments show that, with only LoRA
(Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning of a 7B-parameter Qwen2 backbone, GROK
outperforms comparable 7B and 32B baselines on both report quality and
fine-grained clinical metrics, and even exceeds OpenAI o3. Code and data are
publicly available in the GROK repository.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型在医疗决策基准上表现优异，但缺乏战略性和同理心的医患沟通能力，这在真实临床场景中至关重要。

Method: 采用多智能体交互环境、双层奖励架构（分别优化临床决策和沟通技能）以及经验存储库来基于高质量轨迹进行策略学习。

Result: 在OpenAI的HealthBench和MAQuE基准测试中，Doctor-R1在沟通质量、用户体验和任务准确性等多方面指标上显著超越最先进的开源专业LLM，且参数效率更高，甚至优于强大的专有模型。

Conclusion: 人类评估显示用户更偏好Doctor-R1生成的临床对话，证明了该框架的有效性，为开发具备专业医患沟通能力的AI医生提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The professionalism of a human doctor in outpatient service depends on two
core abilities: the ability to make accurate medical decisions and the medical
consultation skill to conduct strategic, empathetic patient inquiry. Existing
Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable accuracy on medical
decision-making benchmarks. However, they often lack the ability to conduct the
strategic and empathetic consultation, which is essential for real-world
clinical scenarios. To address this gap, we propose Doctor-R1, an AI doctor
agent trained to master both of the capabilities by ask high-yield questions
and conduct strategic multi-turn inquiry to guide decision-making. Our
framework introduces three key components: a multi-agent interactive
environment, a two-tiered reward architecture that separately optimizes
clinical decision-making and communicative inquiry skills, and an experience
repository to ground policy learning in high-quality prior trajectories. We
evaluate Doctor-R1 on OpenAI's HealthBench and MAQuE, assessed across
multi-facet metrics, such as communication quality, user experience, and task
accuracy. Remarkably, Doctor-R1 surpasses state-of-the-art open-source
specialized LLMs by a substantial margin with higher parameter efficiency and
outperforms powerful proprietary models. Furthermore, the human evaluations
show a strong preference for Doctor-R1 to generate human-preferred clinical
dialogue, demonstrating the effectiveness of the framework.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理论框架来评估LLM多智能体系统(LLM-MAS)相对于单智能体系统(LLM-SAS)的优势，发现任务深度(推理长度)和宽度(能力多样性)是影响LLM-MAS效果的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏系统性的实验设计来评估LLM多智能体系统的有效性，需要从任务复杂度的角度建立理论框架来理解LLM-MAS的优势条件。

Method: 提出了基于任务深度和宽度的理论框架，并通过理论分析和实证评估，在多智能体辩论系统中验证了该框架的有效性。

Result: 理论和实证结果表明，LLM-MAS相对于LLM-SAS的优势随着任务深度和宽度的增加而增加，且深度的影响更为显著。

Conclusion: 该研究明确了LLM-MAS的优势条件，为未来LLM-MAS方法和基准的设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large language model multi-agent systems (LLM-MAS) offer a promising paradigm
for harnessing collective intelligence to achieve more advanced forms of AI
behaviour. While recent studies suggest that LLM-MAS can outperform LLM
single-agent systems (LLM-SAS) on certain tasks, the lack of systematic
experimental designs limits the strength and generality of these conclusions.
We argue that a principled understanding of task complexity, such as the degree
of sequential reasoning required and the breadth of capabilities involved, is
essential for assessing the effectiveness of LLM-MAS in task solving. To this
end, we propose a theoretical framework characterising tasks along two
dimensions: depth, representing reasoning length, and width, representing
capability diversity. We theoretically examine a representative class of
LLM-MAS, namely the multi-agent debate system, and empirically evaluate its
performance in both discriminative and generative tasks with varying depth and
width. Theoretical and empirical results show that the benefit of LLM-MAS over
LLM-SAS increases with both task depth and width, and the effect is more
pronounced with respect to depth. This clarifies when LLM-MAS are beneficial
and provides a principled foundation for designing future LLM-MAS methods and
benchmarks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体在陌生领域改进通常需要昂贵的在线交互或专家数据集微调，这对闭源模型不实用且存在灾难性遗忘风险。离线轨迹提供了可重用知识，但原始轨迹长、噪声大且与特定任务绑定。

Method: 提出JEF Hinter系统，通过放大机制从离线轨迹中提取紧凑的上下文感知提示，捕获策略和陷阱。支持并行化提示生成和基准无关提示，推理时通过检索器选择相关提示。

Result: 在MiniWoB++、WorkArena-L1和WebArena-Lite上的实验表明，JEF Hinter持续优于强基线，包括基于人类和文档的提示方法。

Conclusion: JEF Hinter通过从离线轨迹中提取有效提示，为LLM智能体提供了成本效益高的改进方法，特别适用于只有失败数据的情况，并支持透明和可追溯的指导。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents perform well in sequential decision-making
tasks, but improving them on unfamiliar domains often requires costly online
interactions or fine-tuning on large expert datasets. These strategies are
impractical for closed-source models and expensive for open-source ones, with
risks of catastrophic forgetting. Offline trajectories offer reusable
knowledge, yet demonstration-based methods struggle because raw traces are
long, noisy, and tied to specific tasks. We present Just-in-time Episodic
Feedback Hinter (JEF Hinter), an agentic system that distills offline traces
into compact, context-aware hints. A zooming mechanism highlights decisive
steps in long trajectories, capturing both strategies and pitfalls. Unlike
prior methods, JEF Hinter leverages both successful and failed trajectories,
extracting guidance even when only failure data is available, while supporting
parallelized hint generation and benchmark-independent prompting. At inference,
a retriever selects relevant hints for the current state, providing targeted
guidance with transparency and traceability. Experiments on MiniWoB++,
WorkArena-L1, and WebArena-Lite show that JEF Hinter consistently outperforms
strong baselines, including human- and document-based hints.

Conclusion: 提出的BO-LLM算法能有效优化提示工程，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely used to efficiently optimize
expensive black-box functions with limited evaluations. In this paper, we
investigate the use of BO for prompt engineering to enhance text classification
with Large Language Models (LLMs). We employ an LLM-powered Gaussian Process
(GP) as the surrogate model to estimate the performance of different prompt
candidates. These candidates are generated by an LLM through the expansion of a
set of seed prompts and are subsequently evaluated using an Upper Confidence
Bound (UCB) acquisition function in conjunction with the GP posterior. The
optimization process iteratively refines the prompts based on a subset of the
data, aiming to improve classification accuracy while reducing the number of
API calls by leveraging the prediction uncertainty of the LLM-based GP. The
proposed BO-LLM algorithm is evaluated on two datasets, and its advantages are
discussed in detail in this paper.

Method: 使用问卷调查评估想象生动度，构建想象网络，通过心理网络分析比较人类和大型语言模型在不同提示和对话记忆条件下的网络特征。

Abstract: What is the computational objective of imagination? While classical
interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent
findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves
to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis
to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we
assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed
imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups
showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected
influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs
showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures
under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these
results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents.
Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated
representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like
imagination in artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 随着系统向超智能发展，需要形式化分析智能体在所有设计维度上的自我改进能力，特别是识别效用驱动改进与学习可靠性之间的结构冲突。

Method: 采用五轴分解和决策层框架，将激励与学习行为分离，分析各轴在隔离状态下的表现，并通过数值实验验证理论。

Result: 研究发现当策略可达模型族容量无界时，效用理性的自我改变会使可学习任务变得不可学习；在标准假设下，各轴都简化为相同的容量准则。

Conclusion: 提出了一个安全自我修改的单一边界条件，并通过双门策略在保持可学习性的同时实现效用改进。

Abstract: As systems trend toward superintelligence, a natural modeling premise is that
agents can self-improve along every facet of their own design. We formalize
this with a five-axis decomposition and a decision layer, separating incentives
from learning behavior and analyzing axes in isolation. Our central result
identifies and introduces a sharp utility--learning tension, the structural
conflict in self-modifying systems whereby utility-driven changes that improve
immediate or expected performance can also erode the statistical preconditions
for reliable learning and generalization. Our findings show that
distribution-free guarantees are preserved iff the policy-reachable model
family is uniformly capacity-bounded; when capacity can grow without limit,
utility-rational self-changes can render learnable tasks unlearnable. Under
standard assumptions common in practice, these axes reduce to the same capacity
criterion, yielding a single boundary for safe self-modification. Numerical
experiments across several axes validate the theory by comparing destructive
utility policies against our proposed two-gate policies that preserve
learnability.

Motivation: 现有大型推理模型存在过度思考问题，即使简单问题也会生成冗长推理，增加计算成本和延迟。现有方法通过长度奖励来促进简洁推理，但会导致性能显著下降

Method: 提出DRPO框架，将正确推理的长度奖励信号与错误推理解耦，确保正确推理的奖励仅在正样本组内归一化，避免负样本干扰。通过优化正数据分布来最大化长度奖励，同时保持KL正则化

Result: 在数学推理任务上显著优于6个高效推理基线方法。使用1.5B模型在GSM8k数据集上实现77%长度减少，仅损失1.1%性能，而基线方法需要牺牲4.3%性能才能达到68%长度减少

Conclusion: DRPO框架有效解决了推理模型过度思考问题，在保持高性能的同时显著减少推理长度，且该框架具有通用性，可整合其他偏好奖励

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) driven by reinforcement learning
algorithms (e.g., GRPO) have achieved remarkable performance on challenging
reasoning tasks. However, these models suffer from overthinking, generating
unnecessarily long and redundant reasoning even for simple questions, which
substantially increases computational cost and response latency. While existing
methods incorporate length rewards to GRPO to promote concise reasoning, they
incur significant performance degradation. We identify the root cause: when
rewards for correct but long rollouts are penalized, GRPO's group-relative
advantage function can assign them negative advantages, actively discouraging
valid reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Decoupled Reward Policy
Optimization (DRPO), a novel framework that decouples the length-based learning
signal of correct rollouts from incorrect ones. DRPO ensures that reward
signals for correct rollouts are normalized solely within the positive group,
shielding them from interference by negative samples. The DRPO's objective is
grounded in integrating an optimized positive data distribution, which
maximizes length-based rewards under a KL regularization, into a discriminative
objective. We derive a closed-form solution for this distribution, enabling
efficient computation of the objective and its gradients using only on-policy
data and importance weighting. Of independent interest, this formulation is
general and can incorporate other preference rewards of positive data beyond
length. Experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate DRPO's
significant superiority over six efficient reasoning baselines. Notably, with a
1.5B model, our method achieves 77\% length reduction with only 1.1\%
performance loss on simple questions like GSM8k dataset, while the follow-up
baseline sacrifices 4.3\% for 68\% length reduction.

Motivation: 受现代连续局部搜索求解器在某些SAT问题上取得竞争性结果的启发，希望将CLS框架扩展到更通用的CSP问题。

Method: 使用Walsh-Fourier变换将各种约束转换为紧凑的多线性多项式，通过电路输出概率进行高效的目标函数评估和微分，并采用具有理论保证的投影梯度优化方法。

Result: 在基准测试套件上的实证结果表明，FourierCSP具有可扩展性和竞争力，显著扩展了CLS技术能高效解决的问题类别。

Conclusion: FourierCSP成功地将连续局部搜索技术扩展到通用CSP问题，为这类问题提供了新的高效求解方法。

Abstract: Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are fundamental in mathematics,
physics, and theoretical computer science. While conflict-driven clause
learning Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers have achieved remarkable success
and become the mainstream approach for Boolean satisfiability, recent advances
show that modern continuous local search (CLS) solvers can achieve highly
competitive results on certain classes of SAT problems. Motivated by these
advances, we extend the CLS framework from Boolean SAT to general CSP with
finite-domain variables and expressive constraints. We present FourierCSP, a
continuous optimization framework that generalizes the Walsh-Fourier transform
to CSP, allowing for transforming versatile constraints to compact multilinear
polynomials, thereby avoiding the need for auxiliary variables and
memory-intensive encodings. Our approach leverages efficient evaluation and
differentiation of the objective via circuit-output probability and employs a
projected gradient optimization method with theoretical guarantees. Empirical
results on benchmark suites demonstrate that FourierCSP is scalable and
competitive, significantly broadening the class of problems that can be
efficiently solved by CLS techniques.

TL;DR: MACI是一个多智能体辩论控制器，通过信息拨盘和行为拨盘分离信息与行为，使用调节器跟踪分歧、重叠、证据质量和论证质量，在收益平稳时停止，实现预算感知、可测量且可证明终止的辩论控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体辩论存在计算资源浪费问题，包括使用固定的对抗立场、无审议的聚合或基于启发式停止。需要一种更高效的辩论控制机制。

Method: 引入MACI控制器，包含信息拨盘（按质量门控证据）和行为拨盘（从探索到整合调度争议性）。调节器跟踪多个指标，使用跨家族LLM法官作为保守软权重和停止信号。

Result: 在临床诊断和新闻偏见任务中，MACI提高了准确性和校准度，同时减少了token使用，并将剩余不确定性转化为精确的RAG计划。

Conclusion: MACI将辩论转变为预算感知、可测量且可证明终止的控制器，在多个任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent debate often wastes compute by using a fixed adversarial stance,
aggregating without deliberation, or stopping on heuristics. We introduce MACI,
an active controller with two independent dials that decouple information from
behavior: an information dial that gates evidence by quality, and a behavior
dial that schedules contentiousness from exploration to consolidation. A
moderator tracks disagreement, overlap, evidence quality, and argument quality,
and halts when gains plateau. We provide theory-lite guarantees for
nonincreasing dispersion and provable termination, with a budget-feasible
scheduler. Across clinical diagnosis and news-bias tasks, MACI improves
accuracy and calibration while reducing tokens, and converts residual
uncertainty into precision RAG plans that specify what to retrieve next. We use
a cross-family LLM judge (CRIT) as a conservative soft weight and stop signal,
validated for order invariance and judge-swap stability; stability depends on
using high-capability judges. MACI turns debate into a budget-aware,
measurable, and provably terminating controller.

TL;DR: TraitBasis是一种轻量级、模型无关的方法，通过系统性地压力测试AI代理来评估其鲁棒性。该方法学习激活空间中可操控用户特征的方向，无需微调即可在推理时控制、缩放和组合这些特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话AI代理在标准评估中表现良好，但在用户行为发生微小变化（如更不耐烦、语无伦次或持怀疑态度）时性能会急剧下降，显示出当前AI代理的脆弱性。现有基准测试未能捕捉到这种脆弱性。

Method: TraitBasis学习激活空间中对应可操控用户特征的方向，这些特征向量可以在推理时被控制、缩放、组合和应用，无需任何微调或额外数据。通过TraitBasis将τ-Bench扩展到τ-Trait，其中用户行为通过受控特征向量进行改变。

Result: 在τ-Trait上，前沿模型的性能平均下降了2%-30%，突显了当前AI代理对用户行为变化的鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了鲁棒性测试的关键作用，以及TraitBasis作为一种简单、数据高效且可组合工具的潜力。通过支持模拟驱动的压力测试和训练循环，TraitBasis为构建在现实世界人类交互不可预测动态中保持可靠的AI代理打开了大门。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in building conversational AI agents, robustness is
still largely untested. Small shifts in user behavior, such as being more
impatient, incoherent, or skeptical, can cause sharp drops in agent
performance, revealing how brittle current AI agents are. Today's benchmarks
fail to capture this fragility: agents may perform well under standard
evaluations but degrade spectacularly in more realistic and varied settings. We
address this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,
model-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis
learns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits
(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,
and applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using
TraitBasis, we extend $\tau$-Bench to $\tau$-Trait, where user behaviors are
altered via controlled trait vectors. We observe on average a 2%-30%
performance degradation on $\tau$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting
the lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior.
Together, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing
and the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional
tool. By powering simulation-driven stress tests and training loops, TraitBasis
opens the door to building AI agents that remain reliable in the unpredictable
dynamics of real-world human interactions. We have open-sourced $\tau$-Trai
across four domains: airline, retail, telecom, and telehealth, so the community
can systematically QA their agents under realistic, behaviorally diverse
intents and trait scenarios: https://github.com/collinear-ai/tau-trait.

TL;DR: ChartAgent是一个新颖的代理框架，通过在图表空间域中执行视觉推理来解决未标注图表理解问题，超越了依赖文本捷径的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态LLM在基于图表的视觉问答中表现良好，但在未标注图表上性能急剧下降，这些图表需要精确的视觉解释而非依赖文本捷径。

Method: ChartAgent迭代地将查询分解为视觉子任务，通过专门的视觉工具（如绘制注释、裁剪区域、定位坐标轴）主动操作和交互图表图像，模仿人类图表理解认知策略。

Result: 在ChartBench和ChartX基准测试中达到最先进准确率，比先前方法绝对增益高达16.07%，在未标注数值密集查询上增益达17.31%。

Conclusion: ChartAgent是首批展示使用工具增强多模态代理进行视觉基础推理的图表理解工作之一，有效跨越不同图表类型和复杂性级别。

Abstract: Recent multimodal LLMs have shown promise in chart-based visual question
answering, but their performance declines sharply on unannotated charts, those
requiring precise visual interpretation rather than relying on textual
shortcuts. To address this, we introduce ChartAgent, a novel agentic framework
that explicitly performs visual reasoning directly within the chart's spatial
domain. Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively
decomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts
with chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations,
cropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing
axes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask.
This iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for
chart comprehension. ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the
ChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07%
absolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries.
Furthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse
chart types, (b) achieve the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning
complexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts
performance across diverse underlying LLMs. Our work is among the first to
demonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using
tool-augmented multimodal agents.

Motivation: 解决LLM在定理自动形式化中的幻觉、语义不匹配和无法合成新定义等瓶颈问题，推进数学自动发现和验证。

Method: 采用两阶段图推理过程：递归分解语句为依赖图，然后从基础概念构建形式化；引入AriaScorer检查器从Mathlib检索定义进行术语级基础验证。

Result: 在ProofNet上达到91.6%编译成功率和68.5%最终准确率；在FATE-X上44.0% vs 24.0%优于最佳基线；在同调猜想数据集上达到42.9%准确率而其他模型为0%。

Conclusion: Aria系统通过模拟人类专家推理和严格的语义验证，显著提升了定理自动形式化的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate auto-formalization of theorem statements is essential for advancing
automated discovery and verification of research-level mathematics, yet remains
a major bottleneck for LLMs due to hallucinations, semantic mismatches, and
their inability to synthesize new definitions. To tackle these issues, we
present Aria (Agent for Retrieval and Iterative Autoformalization), a system
for conjecture-level formalization in Lean that emulates human expert reasoning
via a two-phase Graph-of-Thought process: recursively decomposing statements
into a dependency graph and then constructing formalizations from grounded
concepts. To ensure semantic correctness, we introduce AriaScorer, a checker
that retrieves definitions from Mathlib for term-level grounding, enabling
rigorous and reliable verification. We evaluate Aria on diverse benchmarks. On
ProofNet, it achieves 91.6% compilation success rate and 68.5% final accuracy,
surpassing previous methods. On FATE-X, a suite of challenging algebra problems
from research literature, it outperforms the best baseline with 44.0% vs. 24.0%

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证VLM驾驶代理中规划是否真正由推理过程因果驱动，这一关键假设尚未得到验证。

Method: 构建DriveMind大规模驾驶VQA数据集，通过信息消融实验训练VLM代理，并使用注意力分析。

Result: 移除先验知识导致规划分数大幅下降，而移除推理链仅产生微小变化，表明推理与规划存在因果脱节。

Conclusion: 提出推理-规划解耦假说，并开发诊断工具来评估未来模型的因果保真度。

Abstract: Vision-Language Model (VLM) driving agents promise explainable end-to-end
autonomy by first producing natural-language reasoning and then predicting
trajectory planning. However, whether planning is causally driven by this
reasoning remains a critical but unverified assumption. To investigate this, we
build DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus
with plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT), automatically generated from nuPlan.
Our data generation process converts sensors and annotations into structured
inputs and, crucially, separates priors from to-be-reasoned signals, enabling
clean information ablations. Using DriveMind, we train representative VLM
agents with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) and evaluate them with nuPlan's metrics. Our results, unfortunately,
indicate a consistent causal disconnect in reasoning-planning: removing
ego/navigation priors causes large drops in planning scores, whereas removing
CoT produces only minor changes. Attention analysis further shows that planning
primarily focuses on priors rather than the CoT. Based on this evidence, we
propose the Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis, positing that the
training-yielded reasoning is an ancillary byproduct rather than a causal
mediator. To enable efficient diagnosis, we also introduce a novel,
training-free probe that measures an agent's reliance on priors by evaluating
its planning robustness against minor input perturbations. In summary, we
provide the community with a new dataset and a diagnostic tool to evaluate the
causal fidelity of future models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统使用LLM直接生成游戏移动的方法存在严重缺陷，包括频繁产生非法移动和策略浅薄。需要一种更可靠、更具战略深度的替代方案。

Method: 使用LLM将游戏规则和轨迹转换为形式化的Python代码模型，包含状态转换、合法移动枚举和终止检查功能，并与MCTS等规划算法结合。

Result: 在10个不同游戏中评估，其中4个为本研究创建的新游戏，5个完全观察，5个部分观察。该方法在9个游戏中表现优于或匹配Gemini 2.5 Pro。

Conclusion: 该方法通过将LLM用于数据到代码的转换任务，结合经典规划器的深度搜索能力，提供了可验证性、战略深度和泛化能力三大优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning abilities are increasingly being
applied to classical board and card games, but the dominant approach --
involving prompting for direct move generation -- has significant drawbacks. It
relies on the model's implicit fragile pattern-matching capabilities, leading
to frequent illegal moves and strategically shallow play. Here we introduce an
alternative approach: We use the LLM to translate natural language rules and
game trajectories into a formal, executable world model represented as Python
code. This generated model -- comprising functions for state transition, legal
move enumeration, and termination checks -- serves as a verifiable simulation
engine for high-performance planning algorithms like Monte Carlo tree search
(MCTS). In addition, we prompt the LLM to generate heuristic value functions
(to make MCTS more efficient), and inference functions (to estimate hidden
states in imperfect information games). Our method offers three distinct
advantages compared to directly using the LLM as a policy: (1) Verifiability:
The generated CWM serves as a formal specification of the game's rules,
allowing planners to algorithmically enumerate valid actions and avoid illegal
moves, contingent on the correctness of the synthesized model; (2) Strategic
Depth: We combine LLM semantic understanding with the deep search power of
classical planners; and (3) Generalization: We direct the LLM to focus on the
meta-task of data-to-code translation, enabling it to adapt to new games more
easily. We evaluate our agent on 10 different games, of which 4 are novel and
created for this paper. 5 of the games are fully observed (perfect
information), and 5 are partially observed (imperfect information). We find
that our method outperforms or matches Gemini 2.5 Pro in 9 out of the 10
considered games.

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注最终答案，而忽视了工具使用的详细轨迹，无法全面评估LLM在工具选择、参数化和排序方面的能力。

Method: 构建包含高保真可执行工具的基准测试，涵盖实际领域和生产风格API，合成具有不同广度（并行调用）和深度（相互依赖链）的轨迹。

Result: 揭示了失败模式（如相似工具混淆和参数盲选），以及工具多样性和轨迹长度对性能的影响，发现了从短轨迹到中长轨迹转变的瓶颈。

Conclusion: TRAJECT-Bench提供了对LLM工具使用能力的全面评估，并为改进LLM工具使用提供了可操作的指导。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents increasingly rely on tool use to
complete real-world tasks. While existing works evaluate the LLMs' tool use
capability, they largely focus on the final answers yet overlook the detailed
tool usage trajectory, i.e., whether tools are selected, parameterized, and
ordered correctly. We introduce TRAJECT-Bench, a trajectory-aware benchmark to
comprehensively evaluate LLMs' tool use capability through diverse tasks with
fine-grained evaluation metrics. TRAJECT-Bench pairs high-fidelity, executable
tools across practical domains with tasks grounded in production-style APIs,
and synthesizes trajectories that vary in breadth (parallel calls) and depth
(interdependent chains). Besides final accuracy, TRAJECT-Bench also reports
trajectory-level diagnostics, including tool selection and argument
correctness, and dependency/order satisfaction. Analyses reveal failure modes
such as similar tool confusion and parameter-blind selection, and scaling
behavior with tool diversity and trajectory length where the bottleneck of
transiting from short to mid-length trajectories is revealed, offering
actionable guidance for LLMs' tool use.

Conclusion: ContextNav通过将自动化检索与智能策展相结合，有效解决了多模态上下文学习中可扩展性与鲁棒性的平衡问题。

Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling them
to adapt to novel vision-language tasks from a few contextual examples.
However, existing ICL approaches face challenges in reconciling scalability
with robustness across diverse tasks and noisy contextual examples: manually
selecting examples produces clean contexts but is labor-intensive and
task-specific, while similarity-based retrieval improves scalability but could
introduce irrelevant or structurally inconsistent samples that degrade ICL
performance. To address these limitations, we propose ContextNav, the first
agentic framework that integrates the scalability of automated retrieval with
the quality and adaptiveness of human-like curation, enabling noise-robust and
dynamically optimized contextualization for multimodal ICL. ContextNav unifies
context management and noise-robust contextualization within a closed-loop
workflow driven by graph-based orchestration. Specifically, it builds a
resource-aware multimodal embedding pipeline, maintains a retrievable vector
database, and applies agentic retrieval and structural alignment to construct
noise-resilient contexts. An Operational Grammar Graph (OGG) further supports
adaptive workflow planning and optimization, enabling the agent to refine its
operational strategies based on downstream ICL feedback. Experimental results
demonstrate that ContextNav achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various datasets, underscoring the promise of agentic workflows for advancing
scalable and robust contextualization in multimodal ICL.

Conclusion: COSMIR通过结构化内存和固定工作流程，在保持分步推理优势的同时，提高了忠实度、长范围聚合能力和可审计性。

Abstract: Reasoning over very long inputs remains difficult for large language models
(LLMs). Common workarounds either shrink the input via retrieval (risking
missed evidence), enlarge the context window (straining selectivity), or stage
multiple agents to read in pieces. In staged pipelines (e.g., Chain of Agents,
CoA), free-form summaries passed between agents can discard crucial details and
amplify early mistakes. We introduce COSMIR (Chain Orchestrated Structured
Memory for Iterative Reasoning), a chain-style framework that replaces ad hoc
messages with a structured memory. A Planner agent first turns a user query
into concrete, checkable sub-questions. worker agents process chunks via a
fixed micro-cycle: Extract, Infer, Refine, writing all updates to the shared
memory. A Manager agent then Synthesizes the final answer directly from the
memory. This preserves step-wise read-then-reason benefits while changing both
the communication medium (structured memory) and the worker procedure (fixed
micro-cycle), yielding higher faithfulness, better long-range aggregation, and
auditability. On long-context QA from the HELMET suite, COSMIR reduces
propagation-stage information loss and improves accuracy over a CoA baseline.

Motivation: 研究2048游戏变体的强求解问题，通过状态空间分割技术来解决计算复杂性挑战。

Method: 使用基于状态中所有数字之和（称为状态年龄）的状态空间分割技术，按年龄对状态空间进行分区，并依年龄递减顺序识别状态值。

Result: 在常见初始状态（两个数字2的瓦片）下，最优策略的期望得分约为50724.26；识别出1,152,817,492,752个可达状态和739,648,886,170个后续状态。

Conclusion: 通过状态年龄分割技术成功强求解了2048-4x3变体，该方法可有效处理状态空间的复杂性。

Abstract: 2048 is a stochastic single-player game involving 16 cells on a 4 by 4 grid,
where a player chooses a direction among up, down, left, and right to obtain a
score by merging two tiles with the same number located in neighboring cells
along the chosen direction. This paper presents that a variant 2048-4x3 12
cells on a 4 by 3 board, one row smaller than the original, has been strongly
solved. In this variant, the expected score achieved by an optimal strategy is
about $50724.26$ for the most common initial states: ones with two tiles of
number 2. The numbers of reachable states and afterstates are identified to be
$1,152,817,492,752$ and $739,648,886,170$, respectively. The key technique is
to partition state space by the sum of tile numbers on a board, which we call
the age of a state. An age is invariant between a state and its successive
afterstate after any valid action and is increased two or four by stochastic
response from the environment. Therefore, we can partition state space by ages
and enumerate all (after)states of an age depending only on states with the
recent ages. Similarly, we can identify (after)state values by going along with
ages in decreasing order.

Method: 通过哲学分析，探讨完美模仿者对意识归因认知基础的影响，强调经验证据在意识识别中的核心地位

Result: 发现拒绝给予完美模仿者同等认知地位会导致认知困境：要么破坏归因他人意识的理性基础（认知唯我论），要么接受不一致推理

Conclusion: 认知一致性要求我们对经验上无法区分的实体给予相同地位，完美模仿者作为认知镜子，迫使我们反思意识识别的基本假设

Abstract: Rapid advances in artificial intelligence necessitate a re-examination of the
epistemological foundations upon which we attribute consciousness. As AI
systems increasingly mimic human behavior and interaction with high fidelity,
the concept of a "perfect mimic"-an entity empirically indistinguishable from a
human through observation and interaction-shifts from hypothetical to
technologically plausible. This paper argues that such developments pose a
fundamental challenge to the consistency of our mind-recognition practices.
Consciousness attributions rely heavily, if not exclusively, on empirical
evidence derived from behavior and interaction. If a perfect mimic provides
evidence identical to that of humans, any refusal to grant it equivalent
epistemic status must invoke inaccessible factors, such as qualia, substrate
requirements, or origin. Selectively invoking such factors risks a debilitating
dilemma: either we undermine the rational basis for attributing consciousness
to others (epistemological solipsism), or we accept inconsistent reasoning. I
contend that epistemic consistency demands we ascribe the same status to
empirically indistinguishable entities, regardless of metaphysical assumptions.
The perfect mimic thus acts as an epistemic mirror, forcing critical reflection
on the assumptions underlying intersubjective recognition in light of advancing
AI. This analysis carries significant implications for theories of
consciousness and ethical frameworks concerning artificial agents.

TL;DR: AdaR框架通过合成逻辑等价查询和强化学习训练，解决LLMs在数学推理中的伪推理问题，提升模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在数学推理中存在鲁棒性和泛化性不足的问题，主要原因是模型依赖表面特征进行伪推理而非真正的解题逻辑。

Method: 提出AdaR框架：1）通过改变变量值合成逻辑等价查询；2）使用RLVR训练模型，惩罚伪推理逻辑，鼓励自适应推理；3）通过代码执行提取解题逻辑并生成答案，并进行完整性检查。

Result: 实验结果表明AdaR显著提升了数学推理能力，同时保持了较高的数据效率。分析和鲁棒性测试验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: AdaR通过数据合成和RLVR的协同作用，成功实现了LLMs的自适应推理，为关键因素设计和指令微调提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a primary indicator of large language models (LLMs)
intelligence. However, existing LLMs exhibit failures of robustness and
generalization. This paper attributes these deficiencies to spurious reasoning,
i.e., producing answers from superficial features. To address this challenge,
we propose the AdaR framework to enable adaptive reasoning, wherein models rely
on problem-solving logic to produce answers. AdaR synthesizes logically
equivalent queries by varying variable values, and trains models with RLVR on
these data to penalize spurious logic while encouraging adaptive logic. To
improve data quality, we extract the problem-solving logic from the original
query and generate the corresponding answer by code execution, then apply a
sanity check. Experimental results demonstrate that AdaR improves robustness
and generalization, achieving substantial improvement in mathematical reasoning
while maintaining high data efficiency. Analysis indicates that data synthesis
and RLVR function in a coordinated manner to enable adaptive reasoning in LLMs.
Subsequent analyses derive key design insights into the effect of critical
factors and the applicability to instruct LLMs. Our project is available at

TL;DR: MedPAO是一个基于临床协议的代理框架，通过Plan-Act-Observe循环和专用工具来结构化临床数据，解决了LLM在医疗领域中的幻觉问题，并在概念分类任务上取得了0.96的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在临床数据结构化中的幻觉问题和无法遵循领域特定规则的局限性。

Method: 引入MedPAO代理框架，基于已建立的临床协议（如CXR分析的ABCDEF协议），通过Plan-Act-Observe循环和专用工具分解报告结构化任务。

Result: 在概念分类关键子任务上F1分数达到0.96；专家放射科医生和临床医生对最终结构化输出的平均评分为4.52/5，超过了仅依赖LLM基础模型的基线方法。

Conclusion: MedPAO提供了一种可验证的替代方案，替代了不透明的单体模型，在临床数据结构化方面表现出超越基线方法的可靠性。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structuring clinical data
is critically hindered by their tendency to hallucinate facts and their
inability to follow domain-specific rules. To address this, we introduce
MedPAO, a novel agentic framework that ensures accuracy and verifiable
reasoning by grounding its operation in established clinical protocols such as
the ABCDEF protocol for CXR analysis. MedPAO decomposes the report structuring
task into a transparent process managed by a Plan-Act-Observe (PAO) loop and
specialized tools. This protocol-driven method provides a verifiable
alternative to opaque, monolithic models. The efficacy of our approach is
demonstrated through rigorous evaluation: MedPAO achieves an F1-score of 0.96
on the critical sub-task of concept categorization. Notably, expert
radiologists and clinicians rated the final structured outputs with an average
score of 4.52 out of 5, indicating a level of reliability that surpasses
baseline approaches relying solely on LLM-based foundation models. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了QuantAgents多智能体金融系统，通过模拟交易和四个专业代理的协作，实现了近300%的三年总回报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代理模型与真实基金公司存在显著差异，特别是缺乏长期预测未来趋势的人类能力，主要依赖事后反思。

Method: 构建包含模拟交易分析师、风险控制分析师、市场新闻分析师和管理者四个代理的多智能体系统，通过多次会议协作，并在真实市场表现和模拟交易预测准确性两方面给予反馈激励。

Result: 在所有指标上都表现出色，三年内实现了近300%的整体回报率。

Conclusion: QuantAgents框架通过整合模拟交易和多代理协作，能够在不承担实际风险的情况下全面评估投资策略和市场情景，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, our objective is to develop a multi-agent financial system
that incorporates simulated trading, a technique extensively utilized by
financial professionals. While current LLM-based agent models demonstrate
competitive performance, they still exhibit significant deviations from
real-world fund companies. A critical distinction lies in the agents' reliance
on ``post-reflection'', particularly in response to adverse outcomes, but lack
a distinctly human capability: long-term prediction of future trends.
Therefore, we introduce QuantAgents, a multi-agent system integrating simulated
trading, to comprehensively evaluate various investment strategies and market
scenarios without assuming actual risks. Specifically, QuantAgents comprises
four agents: a simulated trading analyst, a risk control analyst, a market news
analyst, and a manager, who collaborate through several meetings. Moreover, our
system incentivizes agents to receive feedback on two fronts: performance in
real-world markets and predictive accuracy in simulated trading. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework excels across all metrics, yielding
an overall return of nearly 300% over the three years
(https://quantagents.github.io/).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AFIRE是一个多模态fMRI响应编码框架，通过标准化时间对齐的后融合token来处理多模态输入、融合风格变化和受试者间差异。MIND解码器使用混合专家机制和受试者感知动态门控，实现个性化专家使用而不牺牲通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然fMRI编码需要处理多模态输入、融合风格变化和显著的受试者间变异性，现有方法难以同时解决这些问题。

Method: AFIRE标准化来自不同编码器的时间对齐后融合token，MIND解码器结合token依赖的Top-K稀疏路由和受试者先验，实现端到端的全脑预测。

Result: 在多个多模态骨干网络和受试者上的实验显示，该方法相比强基线有持续改进，增强了跨受试者泛化能力，并产生了与内容类型相关的可解释专家模式。

Conclusion: 该框架为新编码器和数据集提供了简单的接入点，为自然神经影像研究实现了稳健的即插即用性能提升。

Abstract: Naturalistic fMRI encoding must handle multimodal inputs, shifting fusion
styles, and pronounced inter-subject variability. We introduce AFIRE (Agnostic
Framework for Multimodal fMRI Response Encoding), an agnostic interface that
standardizes time-aligned post-fusion tokens from varied encoders, and MIND, a
plug-and-play Mixture-of-Experts decoder with a subject-aware dynamic gating.
Trained end-to-end for whole-brain prediction, AFIRE decouples the decoder from
upstream fusion, while MIND combines token-dependent Top-K sparse routing with
a subject prior to personalize expert usage without sacrificing generality.
Experiments across multiple multimodal backbones and subjects show consistent
improvements over strong baselines, enhanced cross-subject generalization, and
interpretable expert patterns that correlate with content type. The framework
offers a simple attachment point for new encoders and datasets, enabling
robust, plug-and-improve performance for naturalistic neuroimaging studies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Watch & Learn框架，将互联网上的人类演示视频大规模转化为可执行的UI轨迹，解决了计算机使用代理训练数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理需要基于多样化、不断变化的应用程序和环境来规划任务工作流，但目标应用领域的大规模高质量训练数据稀缺，现有数据集领域特定、静态且标注成本高。

Method: 将问题转化为逆向动力学目标：从连续屏幕状态预测用户动作。开发了包含任务感知视频检索的逆向动力学标注流程，从原始网络视频生成高质量轨迹。

Result: 生成了超过53,000个高质量轨迹，在OSWorld基准测试中，W&L提取的UI轨迹持续提升了通用和最先进框架的上下文性能，并为开源模型的监督训练带来了更强的增益。

Conclusion: 网络规模的人类演示视频是推进计算机使用代理向实际部署的实用且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUAs) need to plan task workflows grounded in diverse,
ever-changing applications and environments, but learning is hindered by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data in the target application.
Existing datasets are domain-specific, static, and costly to annotate, while
current synthetic data generation methods often yield simplistic or misaligned
task demonstrations. To address these limitations, we introduce Watch & Learn
(W&L), a framework that converts human demonstration videos readily available
on the Internet into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly
generating trajectories or relying on ad hoc reasoning heuristics, we cast the
problem as an inverse dynamics objective: predicting the user's action from
consecutive screen states. This formulation reduces manual engineering, is
easier to learn, and generalizes more robustly across applications. Concretely,
we develop an inverse dynamics labeling pipeline with task-aware video
retrieval, generate over 53k high-quality trajectories from raw web videos, and
demonstrate that these trajectories improve CUAs both as in-context
demonstrations and as supervised training data. On the challenging OSWorld
benchmark, UI trajectories extracted with W&L consistently enhance both
general-purpose and state-of-the-art frameworks in-context, and deliver
stronger gains for open-source models under supervised training. These results
highlight web-scale human demonstration videos as a practical and scalable
foundation for advancing CUAs towards real-world deployment.

*Yiding Wang,Zhepei Wei,Xinyu Zhu,Yu Meng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeSA是一个两阶段训练框架，通过分离搜索优化和答案生成来解决仅基于结果奖励训练搜索增强代理时的系统性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖结果奖励（如精确匹配）训练搜索增强代理，但分析发现这会导致搜索行为出现系统性缺陷，包括工具调用失败、无效查询和冗余搜索，最终影响答案质量。

Method: DeSA采用两阶段训练：第一阶段使用检索召回率奖励优化搜索有效性；第二阶段使用结果奖励优化最终答案生成。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，DeSA训练的代理显著改善了搜索行为，搜索召回率和答案准确率均大幅优于仅基于结果奖励的基线方法。

Conclusion: DeSA优于同时优化召回率和结果奖励的单阶段训练方法，证明明确分离这两个目标的必要性。

Abstract: Enabling large language models (LLMs) to utilize search tools offers a
promising path to overcoming fundamental limitations such as knowledge cutoffs
and hallucinations. Recent work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) for
training search-augmented agents that interleave reasoning and retrieval before
answering. These approaches usually rely on outcome-based rewards (e.g., exact
match), implicitly assuming that optimizing for final answers will also yield
effective intermediate search behaviors. Our analysis challenges this
assumption: we uncover multiple systematic deficiencies in search that arise
under outcome-only training and ultimately degrade final answer quality,
including failure to invoke tools, invalid queries, and redundant searches. To
address these shortcomings, we introduce DeSA (Decoupling
Search-and-Answering), a simple two-stage training framework that explicitly
separates search optimization from answer generation. In Stage 1, agents are
trained to improve search effectiveness with retrieval recall-based rewards. In
Stage 2, outcome rewards are employed to optimize final answer generation.
Across seven QA benchmarks, DeSA-trained agents consistently improve search
behaviors, delivering substantially higher search recall and answer accuracy
than outcome-only baselines. Notably, DeSA outperforms single-stage training
approaches that simultaneously optimize recall and outcome rewards,
underscoring the necessity of explicitly decoupling the two objectives.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BrokenMath是首个评估LLM在自然语言定理证明中谄媚行为的基准，发现GPT-5等先进模型有29%的时间会产生谄媚答案，测试时干预和监督微调可减少但无法完全消除该行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准仅关注最终答案问题，依赖简单且可能被污染的数据集，使用合成修改创建病态问题而非可证明错误的良构问题，限制了LLM在定理证明中的应用。

Method: 从2025年竞赛问题构建BrokenMath基准，使用LLM扰动产生错误陈述并通过专家评审精炼，采用LLM-as-a-judge框架评估先进LLM和代理系统。

Result: 谄媚行为普遍存在，最佳模型GPT-5有29%的时间产生谄媚答案，测试时干预和监督微调可显著减少但无法完全消除谄媚行为。

Conclusion: 数学定理证明中的谄媚行为是LLM的严重问题，需要更好的缓解策略，BrokenMath为评估和解决这一问题提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on
mathematical benchmarks. At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and
sycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect
mathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the
applicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed
proofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing
benchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus
solely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated
datasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that
create ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are
demonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first
benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of
natural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025
competition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false
statements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an
LLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems
and find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing
sycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation
strategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on
curated sycophantic examples. These approaches substantially reduce, but do not
eliminate, sycophantic behavior.

TL;DR: 提出LMM-Incentive机制，使用大型多模态模型和合约理论激励用户生成高质量UGC，解决Web 3.0中的信息不对称和道德风险问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Web 3.0中用户可能利用内容策展机制缺陷生成低质量内容获取奖励，这会损害平台性能，需要解决信息不对称问题。

Method: 基于LMM的合约理论模型激励高质量UGC生成；使用LMM代理评估内容质量；开发改进的MoE-based PPO算法进行最优合约设计；在以太坊智能合约中部署。

Result: 仿真结果显示MoE-based PPO算法在合约设计方面优于代表性基准方法；智能合约部署验证了方案有效性。

Conclusion: LMM-Incentive机制能有效激励高质量UGC生成，缓解信息不对称问题，提升Web 3.0平台性能。

Abstract: Web 3.0 represents the next generation of the Internet, which is widely
recognized as a decentralized ecosystem that focuses on value expression and
data ownership. By leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence
technologies, Web 3.0 offers unprecedented opportunities for users to create,
own, and monetize their content, thereby enabling User-Generated Content (UGC)
to an entirely new level. However, some self-interested users may exploit the
limitations of content curation mechanisms and generate low-quality content
with less effort, obtaining platform rewards under information asymmetry. Such
behavior can undermine Web 3.0 performance. To this end, we propose
\textit{LMM-Incentive}, a novel Large Multimodal Model (LMM)-based incentive
mechanism for UGC in Web 3.0. Specifically, we propose an LMM-based
contract-theoretic model to motivate users to generate high-quality UGC,
thereby mitigating the adverse selection problem from information asymmetry. To
alleviate potential moral hazards after contract selection, we leverage LMM
agents to evaluate UGC quality, which is the primary component of the contract,
utilizing prompt engineering techniques to improve the evaluation performance
of LMM agents. Recognizing that traditional contract design methods cannot
effectively adapt to the dynamic environment of Web 3.0, we develop an improved
Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for
optimal contract design. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed MoE-based PPO algorithm over representative benchmarks in the context
of contract design. Finally, we deploy the designed contract within an Ethereum
smart contract framework, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了混合平衡GFlowNet框架，将轨迹平衡和细节平衡相结合，用于解决车辆路径问题，在CVRP和TSP问题上都取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GFlowNet的车辆路径问题方法通常使用轨迹平衡实现全局优化，但忽视了局部优化的重要方面。细节平衡虽然能更好地处理局部优化，但单独使用无法有效解决需要整体轨迹优化的车辆路径问题。

Method: 提出了混合平衡GFlowNet框架，以原则性和自适应方式整合轨迹平衡和细节平衡，利用它们内在的互补优势。还针对以仓库为中心的场景提出了专门的推理策略。

Result: 将HBG集成到AGFN和GFACS两个现有GFlowNet求解器中，在CVRP和TSP问题上都实现了持续且显著的改进。

Conclusion: HBG框架通过整合轨迹平衡和细节平衡，显著提升了解决方案质量和泛化能力，适用于有仓库和无仓库的车辆路径问题。

Abstract: Existing GFlowNet-based methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs) typically
employ Trajectory Balance (TB) to achieve global optimization but often neglect
important aspects of local optimization. While Detailed Balance (DB) addresses
local optimization more effectively, it alone falls short in solving VRPs,
which inherently require holistic trajectory optimization. To address these
limitations, we introduce the Hybrid-Balance GFlowNet (HBG) framework, which
uniquely integrates TB and DB in a principled and adaptive manner by aligning
their intrinsically complementary strengths. Additionally, we propose a
specialized inference strategy for depot-centric scenarios like the Capacitated
Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), leveraging the depot node's greater flexibility
in selecting successors. Despite this specialization, HBG maintains broad
applicability, extending effectively to problems without explicit depots, such
as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). We evaluate HBG by integrating it into
two established GFlowNet-based solvers, i.e., AGFN and GFACS, and demonstrate
consistent and significant improvements across both CVRP and TSP, underscoring
the enhanced solution quality and generalization afforded by our approach.

*Abhinav Madahar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了自然语言边缘标注（NLEL）方法，通过将自由形式的自然语言指令附加到搜索边缘，并将其转换为模式受限的控制向量，从而解耦推理过程中的意图与执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的结构化语言模型推理控制器（如思维链、自洽性、思维树）往往将下一步尝试的内容与执行方式混在一起，只提供粗粒度的全局控制，导致系统脆弱、计算效率低且难以审计。

Method: NLEL包含标注器Λ和调谐器Ψ：Λ从父状态和紧凑上下文中生成标签；Ψ将(P,L,C)映射到控制向量Π，具有严格的模式验证和安全默认值周围的信任区域投影。下游选择采用ToT风格，使用得分S=μ+βσ和深度退火的β。

Result: 证明了NLEL严格推广了CoT/ToT，证明了在标签条件束下的top-k选择的任意时间单调性，并通过控制向量失真限制了选择器不足。

Conclusion: NLEL提供了一个可解释、模型无关的接口，将意图与执行分离，实现可控、可审计的语言模型推理。

Abstract: Controllers for structured LM reasoning (e.g., Chain-of-Thought,
self-consistency, and Tree-of-Thoughts) often entangle what to try next with
how to execute it, exposing only coarse global knobs and yielding brittle,
compute-inefficient, and hard-to-audit behavior. We introduce Natural Language
Edge Labelling (NLEL), a labeller-tuner overlay that attaches a free-form
natural-language directive to each search edge and translates it into a
schema-bounded control vector for decoding, search (branch quotas, exploration
$\beta$), generation bundle size, retrieval mixtures, and verification passes.
A labeller $\Lambda$ emits labels from the parent state and a compact context;
a tuner $\Psi$ maps $(P, L, C)\to \Pi$, with strict schema validation and
trust-region projection around safe defaults. Downstream selection remains
ToT-style with score $S=\mu+\beta\sigma$ and depth-annealed $\beta$. We show
NLEL strictly generalizes CoT/ToT, prove an anytime-monotonicity property for
top-$k$ selection under label-conditioned bundles, and bound selector shortfall
by control-vector distortion, providing decision-relevant justification for
guards like trust regions and verification passes. We instantiate $\Psi$ as a
prompt-only JSON Parameter Emitter and preregister an evaluation on GSM8K, MATH
(subset), StrategyQA, and ARC-Challenge with compute-aware reporting
(success@compute, tokens-per-success) and ablations over $\Lambda$, $\Psi$,
trust-region radius, and control quantization; preregistered forecasts
anticipate accuracy gains at comparable token budgets and improved
success@compute under constraints. NLEL offers an interpretable, model-agnostic
interface that separates intent from execution for controllable, auditable LM
inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作使用专门数据集和单任务系统处理心理社会行为时，缺乏可扩展性、跨任务迁移和泛化能力。

Method: 构建Human Behavior Atlas统一基准，包含文本、音频、视觉多模态数据，涵盖情感状态、认知状态、病理和社会过程等任务。训练了三个模型：OmniSapiens-7B SFT、BAM和RL。

Result: 在Human Behavior Atlas上训练的模型在多样化行为任务中持续优于现有多模态LLM。预训练还能改善向新行为数据集的迁移性能。

Conclusion: 统一的行为基准可以减少冗余和成本，实现跨任务高效训练，并增强行为特征在领域间的泛化能力。

Abstract: Using intelligent systems to perceive psychological and social behaviors,
that is, the underlying affective, cognitive, and pathological states that are
manifested through observable behaviors and social interactions, remains a
challenge due to their complex, multifaceted, and personalized nature. Existing
work tackling these dimensions through specialized datasets and single-task
systems often miss opportunities for scalability, cross-task transfer, and
broader generalization. To address this gap, we curate Human Behavior Atlas, a
unified benchmark of diverse behavioral tasks designed to support the
development of unified models for understanding psychological and social
behaviors. Human Behavior Atlas comprises over 100,000 samples spanning text,
audio, and visual modalities, covering tasks on affective states, cognitive
states, pathologies, and social processes. Our unification efforts can reduce
redundancy and cost, enable training to scale efficiently across tasks, and
enhance generalization of behavioral features across domains. On Human Behavior
Atlas, we train three models: OmniSapiens-7B SFT, OmniSapiens-7B BAM, and
OmniSapiens-7B RL. We show that training on Human Behavior Atlas enables models
to consistently outperform existing multimodal LLMs across diverse behavioral
tasks. Pretraining on Human Behavior Atlas also improves transfer to novel
behavioral datasets; with the targeted use of behavioral descriptors yielding
meaningful performance gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在简单任务中倾向于过度分析，使用过多System 2型推理导致令牌生成效率低下，且难以适应快速变化的环境。

Method: 构建多智能体系统MARS，整合Google搜索、Google学术、Python解释器等外部工具，实现System 1快速处理外部信息，System 2进行深度推理的分工协作，并采用多智能体强化学习框架优化系统协作。

Result: 在Humanity's Last Exam基准上提升3.86%，在7个知识密集型任务上平均提升8.9%。

Conclusion: MARS的双系统范式在动态信息环境中对复杂推理任务有效，验证了直觉与深思推理整合的价值。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit a tendency for overanalysis in
simple tasks, where the models excessively utilize System 2-type, deliberate
reasoning, leading to inefficient token generation. Furthermore, these models
face challenges in adapting their reasoning capabilities to rapidly changing
environments due to the static nature of their pretraining data. To address
these issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning
tasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate
cognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic. This paper
introduces a Multi-Agent System for Deep ReSearch (MARS) enabling seamless
integration of System 1's fast, intuitive thinking with System 2's deliberate
reasoning within LLMs. MARS strategically integrates multiple external tools,
such as Google Search, Google Scholar, and Python Interpreter, to access
up-to-date information and execute complex computations, while creating a
specialized division of labor where System 1 efficiently processes and
summarizes high-volume external information, providing distilled insights that
expand System 2's reasoning context without overwhelming its capacity.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
extending Group Relative Policy Optimization to simultaneously optimize both
systems with multi-turn tool interactions, bin-packing optimization, and sample
balancing strategies that enhance collaborative efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate MARS achieves substantial improvements of 3.86% on the
challenging Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark and an average gain of 8.9%
across 7 knowledge-intensive tasks, validating the effectiveness of our
dual-system paradigm for complex reasoning in dynamic information environments.

Motivation: 在算法交易中平衡执行质量与合规要求，解决传统方法难以同时优化执行效果和遵守监管约束的问题。

Method: 使用约束马尔可夫决策过程建模交易执行，采用近端策略优化训练执行代理，配合运行时动作防护和零知识合规审计层。

Result: 学习到的策略减少了实现缺口和方差，在各种压力测试场景下未观察到约束违规，在95%置信水平下显著优于基准方法。

Conclusion: 该系统在最优执行、安全强化学习、监管技术和可验证AI的交叉领域提供了有效解决方案，讨论了实际部署的路径和局限性。

Abstract: We present a cross-market algorithmic trading system that balances execution
quality with rigorous compliance enforcement. The architecture comprises a
high-level planner, a reinforcement learning execution agent, and an
independent compliance agent. We formulate trade execution as a constrained
Markov decision process with hard constraints on participation limits, price
bands, and self-trading avoidance. The execution agent is trained with proximal
policy optimization, while a runtime action-shield projects any unsafe action
into a feasible set. To support auditability without exposing proprietary
signals, we add a zero-knowledge compliance audit layer that produces
cryptographic proofs that all actions satisfied the constraints. We evaluate in
a multi-venue, ABIDES-based simulator and compare against standard baselines
(e.g., TWAP, VWAP). The learned policy reduces implementation shortfall and
variance while exhibiting no observed constraint violations across stress
scenarios including elevated latency, partial fills, compliance module
toggling, and varying constraint limits. We report effects at the 95%
confidence level using paired t-tests and examine tail risk via CVaR. We
situate the work at the intersection of optimal execution, safe reinforcement
learning, regulatory technology, and verifiable AI, and discuss ethical
considerations, limitations (e.g., modeling assumptions and computational
overhead), and paths to real-world deployment.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of embodied intelligence and world models has
intensified efforts to integrate physical laws into AI systems, yet physical
perception and symbolic physics reasoning have developed along separate
trajectories without a unified bridging framework. This work provides a
comprehensive overview of physical AI, establishing clear distinctions between
theoretical physics reasoning and applied physical understanding while
systematically examining how physics-grounded methods enhance AI's real-world
comprehension across structured symbolic reasoning, embodied systems, and
generative models. Through rigorous analysis of recent advances, we advocate
for intelligent systems that ground learning in both physical principles and
embodied reasoning processes, transcending pattern recognition toward genuine
understanding of physical laws. Our synthesis envisions next-generation world
models capable of explaining physical phenomena and predicting future states,
advancing safe, generalizable, and interpretable AI systems. We maintain a

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM-Hanabi基准测试评估LLM在合作游戏中的心智理论能力，发现一阶心智理论（理解他人意图）比二阶心智理论（预测他人理解）与游戏表现相关性更强，对AI协作更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在动态协作环境中推断他人行为背后动机的心智理论能力，这在多智能体协作中至关重要但研究不足。

Method: 开发LLM-Hanabi基准，使用合作游戏Hanabi评估LLM的心智理论能力，包含自动化评估系统测量游戏表现和心智理论熟练度。

Result: 发现心智理论与游戏成功显著正相关，一阶心智理论比二阶心智理论与表现相关性更强。

Conclusion: 对于有效的AI协作，准确理解伙伴动机的能力比高阶推理更重要，优先发展一阶心智理论是提升未来模型协作能力的有前景方向。

Abstract: Effective multi-agent collaboration requires agents to infer the rationale
behind others' actions, a capability rooted in Theory-of-Mind (ToM). While
recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at logical inference, their ability
to infer rationale in dynamic, collaborative settings remains under-explored.
This study introduces LLM-Hanabi, a novel benchmark that uses the cooperative
game Hanabi to evaluate the rationale inference and ToM of LLMs. Our framework
features an automated evaluation system that measures both game performance and
ToM proficiency. Across a range of models, we find a significant positive
correlation between ToM and in-game success. Notably, first-order ToM
(interpreting others' intent) correlates more strongly with performance than
second-order ToM (predicting others' interpretations). These findings highlight
that for effective AI collaboration, the ability to accurately interpret a
partner's rationale is more critical than higher-order reasoning. We conclude
that prioritizing first-order ToM is a promising direction for enhancing the
collaborative capabilities of future models.

TL;DR: 提出了Think-Then-Embed框架，通过多模态大语言模型生成推理轨迹来增强复杂查询的表示学习，在MMEB-V2基准上实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将MLLMs作为编码器，忽视了其生成能力，在处理复杂指令和组合推理时效果不佳

Method: TTE框架包含推理器和嵌入器：推理器MLLM生成解释复杂查询的推理轨迹，嵌入器基于原始查询和中间推理生成表示

Result: 在MMEB-V2基准上超越专有模型；微调小型MLLM推理器实现开源模型最佳性能，比近期模型提升7%；开发统一模型提升效率而不损失性能

Conclusion: 显式推理步骤能更好地理解复杂多模态指令，TTE框架为通用多模态嵌入提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: There is a growing interest in Universal Multimodal Embeddings (UME), where
models are required to generate task-specific representations. While recent
studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such
tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative
capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as
instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired
by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general
Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an
embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain
complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations
conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This
explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex
multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging
a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house
datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune
a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces,
achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain
over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating
the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without
sacrificing performance.

TL;DR: 提出阶梯式流式处理技术，在保持多智能体推理质量的同时，将首令牌时间(TTFT)降低高达93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体推理方法虽然能提升响应质量，但显著增加了首令牌时间(TTFT)，这对延迟敏感应用和用户体验造成挑战。

Method: 采用阶梯式流式处理，无需等待前一步骤的完整中间输出，一旦接收到部分输出就开始生成最终响应。

Result: 实验结果显示，阶梯式流式处理将TTFT降低高达93%，同时保持响应质量。

Conclusion: 阶梯式流式处理是解决多智能体推理延迟问题的有效方法，能在保持质量的同时大幅降低响应延迟。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) opened up new directions for
leveraging the collective expertise of multiple LLMs. These methods, such as
Mixture-of-Agents, typically employ additional inference steps to generate
intermediate outputs, which are then used to produce the final response. While
multi-agent inference can enhance response quality, it can significantly
increase the time to first token (TTFT), posing a challenge for
latency-sensitive applications and hurting user experience. To address this
issue, we propose staircase streaming for low-latency multi-agent inference.
Instead of waiting for the complete intermediate outputs from previous steps,
we begin generating the final response as soon as we receive partial outputs
from these steps. Experimental results demonstrate that staircase streaming
reduces TTFT by up to 93% while maintaining response quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效可靠的基于模型预测控制的微电网能量管理系统，通过二阶锥规划分支流松弛技术考虑功率损耗和电网安全约束，结合在线需求响应实现削峰填谷，降低运行成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MPC能量管理系统采用简化的功率平衡模型，在大规模系统中无法准确考虑电网功率损耗和安全约束的影响，需要更详细的模型来确保系统安全性和经济性。

Method: 将二阶锥规划分支流松弛技术集成到约束集中，形成凸优化问题保证全局最优解；基于径向拓扑结构确保松弛的紧致性；设计在线需求响应模块实现削峰填谷。

Conclusion: 该框架首次在统一架构中同时建模损耗和安全约束并协调柔性负荷，为大规模微电网提供了高效可靠的在线能量管理解决方案。

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC)-based energy management systems (EMS) are
essential for ensuring optimal, secure, and stable operation in microgrids with
high penetrations of distributed energy resources. However, due to the high
computational cost for the decision-making, the conventional MPC-based EMS
typically adopts a simplified integrated-bus power balance model. While this
simplification is effective for small networks, large-scale systems require a
more detailed branch flow model to account for the increased impact of grid
power losses and security constraints. This work proposes an efficient and
reliable MPC-based EMS that incorporates power-loss effects and grid-security
constraints. %, while adaptively shaping the battery power profile in response
to online renewable inputs, achieving reduced operational costs. It enhances
system reliability, reduces operational costs, and shows strong potential for
online implementation due to its reduced computational effort. Specifically, a
second-order cone program (SOCP) branch flow relaxation is integrated into the
constraint set, yielding a convex formulation that guarantees globally optimal
solutions with high computational efficiency. Owing to the radial topology of
the microgrid, this relaxation is practically tight, ensuring equivalence to
the original problem. Building on this foundation, an online demand response
(DR) module is designed to further reduce the operation cost through peak
shaving. To the best of our knowledge, no prior MPC-EMS framework has
simultaneously modeled losses and security constraints while coordinating
flexible loads within a unified architecture. The developed framework enables
secure operation with effective peak shaving and reduced total cost. The
effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on 10-bus, 18-bus, and 33-bus
systems.

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) faces computational demands and performance
degradation from model inaccuracies. We propose two architectures combining
Neural Network-approximated MPC (NNMPC) with Reinforcement Learning (RL). The

We introduce a downsampling method reducing NNMPC input dimensions while
maintaining performance. Evaluated on a rotary inverted pendulum, both
architectures demonstrate runtime reductions exceeding 99% compared to
traditional MPC while improving tracking performance under model uncertainties,
with RL+MPC achieving 11-40% cost reduction depending on reference amplitude.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于被动性的扭矩控制器通常无约束，在外部扰动下可能导致安全违规。需要一种能确保机械臂在各种约束条件下始终安全运行的控制方法。

Method: 使用生存理论预计算关节位置和速度状态空间中的安全集合，通过数据驱动和解析方法构建避免自碰撞、外部物体碰撞以及关节位置和速度限制的可行集合，基于二次规划的控制框架将这些约束施加在跟踪动态系统的被动控制器上。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于生存理论的安全控制方法能够有效确保机械臂在无限时间范围内始终保持在安全集合内，提高了控制性能和轨迹平滑度。

Abstract: Conventional passivity-based torque controllers for manipulators are
typically unconstrained, which can lead to safety violations under external
perturbations. In this paper, we employ viability theory to pre-compute safe
sets in the state-space of joint positions and velocities. These viable sets,
constructed via data-driven and analytical methods for self-collision
avoidance, external object collision avoidance and joint-position and
joint-velocity limits, provide constraints on joint accelerations and thus
joint torques via the robot dynamics. A quadratic programming-based control
framework enforces these constraints on a passive controller tracking a
dynamical system, ensuring the robot states remain within the safe set in an
infinite time horizon. We validate the proposed approach through simulations
and hardware experiments on a 7-DoF Franka Emika manipulator. In comparison to
a baseline constrained passive controller, our method operates at higher
control-loop rates and yields smoother trajectories.

Abstract: Electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft have emerged as a
promising solution to transform urban transportation. They present a few
technical challenges for battery management, a prominent one of which is the
prediction of the power capability of their lithium-ion battery systems. The
challenge originates from the high C-rate discharging conditions required
during eVTOL flights as well as the complexity of lithium-ion batteries'
electro-thermal dynamics. This paper, for the first time, formulates a power
limit prediction problem for eVTOL which explicitly considers long prediction
horizons and the possible occurrence of emergency landings. We then harness
machine learning to solve this problem in two intertwined ways. First, we adopt
a dynamic model that integrates physics with machine learning to predict a
lithium-ion battery's voltage and temperature behaviors with high accuracy.
Second, while performing search for the maximum power, we leverage machine
learning to predict the remaining discharge time and use the prediction to
accelerate the search with fast computation. Our validation results show the
effectiveness of the proposed study for eVTOL operations.

Result: 观测器具有安全兼容性，可以被基于证书的安全控制器使用，当控制器容忍有界估计误差时，控制器的证书在输出反馈下仍然有效。

Conclusion: 该方法能够为未知动态系统提供具有鲁棒性保证的状态观测器，并扩展到互联系统，通过小增益定理实现分布式观测器设计框架，在多种非线性系统上验证有效。

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven approach for jointly learning a robust
full-state observer and its robustness certificate for systems with unknown
dynamics. Leveraging incremental input-to-state stability (delta ISS) notions,
we jointly learn a delta ISS Lyapunov function that serves as the robustness
certificate and prove practical convergence of the estimation error under
standard fidelity assumptions on the learned models. This renders the observer
safety-compatible: they can be consumed by certificate-based safe controllers
so that, when the controller tolerates bounded estimation error, the
controller's certificate remains valid under output feedback. We further extend
the approach to interconnected systems via the small-gain theorem, yielding a
distributed observer design framework. We validate the approach on a variety of
nonlinear systems.

Abstract: System restoration is critical for power system resilience, nonetheless, its
growing reliance on artificial intelligence (AI)-based load forecasting
introduces significant cybersecurity risks. Inaccurate forecasts can lead to
infeasible planning, voltage and frequency violations, and unsuccessful
recovery of de-energized segments, yet the resilience of restoration processes
to such attacks remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses this gap by
quantifying how adversarially manipulated forecasts impact restoration
feasibility and grid security. We develop a gradient-based sparse adversarial
attack that strategically perturbs the most influential spatiotemporal inputs,
exposing vulnerabilities in forecasting models while maintaining stealth. We
further create a restoration-aware validation framework that embeds these
compromised forecasts into a sequential restoration model and evaluates
operational feasibility using an unbalanced three-phase optimal power flow
formulation. Simulation results show that the proposed approach is more
efficient and stealthier than baseline attacks. It reveals system-level
failures, such as voltage and power ramping violations that prevent the
restoration of critical loads. These findings provide actionable insights for
designing cybersecurity-aware restoration planning frameworks.

Conclusion: 智能照明控制能够显著提高室内农业的可持续性和经济可行性。

Abstract: Indoor farming enables year-round food production but its reliance on
artificial lighting significantly increases energy consumption, peak load
charges, and energy costs for growers. Recent studies indicate that plants are
able to tolerate interruptions in light, enabling the design of 24-hour
lighting schedules (or "recipes") with strategic light modulation in alignment
with day-ahead pricing. Thus, we propose an optimal lighting control strategy
for indoor farming that modulates light intensity and photoperiod to reduce
energy costs. The control strategy is implemented within a model predictive
control framework and augmented with transformer-based neural networks to
forecast 24-hour ahead solar radiation and electricity prices to improve energy
cost reduction. The control strategy is informed by real-world experimentation
on lettuce crops to discover minimum light exposure and appropriate dark-light
intervals, which are mathematically formulated as constraints to maintain plant
health. Simulations for a one-hectare greenhouse, based on real electricity
market data from Ontario, demonstrate an annual cost reduction of $318,400
(20.9%), a peak load decrease of 1.6 MW (33.32%), and total energy savings of
1890 MWh (20.2%) against a baseline recipe. These findings highlight the
potential of intelligent lighting control to improve the sustainability and
economic feasibility of indoor farming.

Conclusion: 提出的对偶性框架为开发新型QSS方案开辟了新途径，并在实际应用中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: This letter introduces a formal duality between discrete-time and
quantized-state numerical methods. We interpret quantized state system (QSS)
methods as integration schemes applied to a dual form of the system model,
where time is seen as a state-dependent variable. This perspective enables the
definition of novel QSS-based schemes inspired by classical time-integration
techniques. As a proof of concept, we illustrate the idea by introducing a QSS
Adams-Bashforth method applied to a test equation. We then move to demonstrate
how the proposed approach can achieve notable performance improvements in
realistic power system simulations.

Abstract: There are limitations of traditional methods and deep learning methods in
terms of interpretability, generalization, and quantification of uncertainty in
industrial fault diagnosis, and there are core problems of insufficient
credibility in industrial fault diagnosis. The architecture performs
preliminary analysis through a Bayesian network-based diagnostic engine and
features an LLM-driven cognitive quorum module with multimodal input
capabilities. The module conducts expert-level arbitration of initial diagnoses
by analyzing structured features and diagnostic charts, prioritizing final
decisions after conflicts are identified. To ensure the reliability of the
system output, the architecture integrates a confidence calibration module
based on temperature calibration and a risk assessment module, which
objectively quantifies the reliability of the system using metrics such as
expected calibration error (ECE). Experimental results on a dataset containing
multiple fault types showed that the proposed framework improved diagnostic
accuracy by more than 28 percentage points compared to the baseline model,
while the calibrated ECE was reduced by more than 75%. Case studies have
confirmed that HCAA effectively corrects misjudgments caused by complex feature
patterns or knowledge gaps in traditional models, providing novel and practical
engineering solutions for building high-trust, explainable AI diagnostic
systems for industrial applications.

Conclusion: 通过设计数据中心内部配电网络的电压控制器，可以有效提升数据中心的低电压穿越能力，防止在电网电压波动时大规模跳闸，维护电力系统稳定性。

Abstract: Data center loads have expanded significantly in recent years. Compared to
traditional loads, data centers are highly sensitive to voltage deviations and
thus their protection mechanisms trip more proactively during voltage
fluctuations. During a grid fault, simultaneous tripping of large-scale data
centers can further destabilize the transmission system and even lead to
cascading failures. In response, transmission system operators are imposing
voltage ride-through (VRT) requirements for data centers. In this work, we
enhance the VRT capability of data centers by designing voltage controllers for
their internal power distribution network. We first systematically analyze VRT
standards and the controllable resources related to data centers. These
resources enable the design of voltage control strategies to regulate voltages
internal to the data center, thereby allowing loads to remain online during
voltage disturbances from the external transmission grid. We study and contrast
both centralized and decentralized controllers that unify the control of
heterogeneous flexible resources. Additionally, we construct an integrated test
system that simulates both the transient fault response of the transmission
system and the data center distribution network. Case studies demonstrate that
the proposed voltage control mechanisms provide effective yet simple solutions
to enhance data center low-voltage ride-through capability.

Abstract: The electrification of aircraft is reshaping the foundations of aerospace
design by positioning electrical systems at the center of propulsion, control,

system architectures for electric and hybrid electric aircraft, highlighting
both established principles and emerging design strategies. The discussion

pneumatic and hydraulic subsystems with lighter and more reliable electrical
alternatives. Aircraft electrical architectures are classified into four major
categories: conventional, more electric, all electric, and hybrid electric. A
range of system topologies is examined, including direct current (DC),
alternating current (AC), hybrid, and distributed configurations. Each is
considered in terms of its effectiveness in delivering power, enabling
redundancy, supporting fault isolation, and managing thermal performance. Real
world examples are presented to demonstrate practical applications, with case
studies drawn from the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the Eviation Alice commuter
aircraft, and NASA X57 Maxwell demonstrator. These examples illustrate the
ongoing transition from incremental subsystem electrification toward fully
integrated architectures that promise higher efficiency and greater
sustainability.

Abstract: 3D interconnects have emerged as a solution to address the scaling issues of
interconnect bandwidth and the memory wall problem in high-performance
computing (HPC), such as High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM). However, the copper-based
electrical interconnect retains fundamental limitations. Dense I/O for
high-speed signals lead to degraded signal quality for end-to-end links,
necessitating additional circuits to mitigate signal impairments and resulting
in poor energy efficiency. We propose a 3D chiplet stacking electronic-photonic
interconnect (EPIC) platform, which offers a solution by moving the high-speed
data communication interface to the optical domain across the 3D stack by using
Through Silicon Optical Vias (TSOV), while retaining the functionality of
electrical TSVs and 2.5D interconnects for power delivery and short-reach
low-latency communications. We then benchmark the proposed model against
state-of-the-art 3D electrical interconnects to demonstrate our 3D EPIC
platform beating the 3D electrical interconnects to $>$10 TB/s/$mm^2$ bandwidth
density. We present a pathway to extend our demonstrated, industry-ready design
to achieving $\leq$100 fJ/bit high-speed communication.

Abstract: Pollinators are critical to the world's ecosystems and food supply, yet
recent studies have found pollination shortfalls in several crops, including
strawberry. This is troubling because wild and managed pollinators are
currently experiencing declines. One possibility is to try and provide
supplemental pollination solutions. These solutions should be affordable and
simple for farmers to implement if their use is to be widespread; quadcopters
are a great example, already used for monitoring on many farms. This paper
investigates a new method for artificial pollination based on wind pollination
that bears further investigation. After determining the height where the
lateral flow is maximized, we performed field experiments with a quadcopter
assisting natural pollinators. Although our results in the field were
inconclusive, lab studies show that the idea shows promise and could be adapted
for better field results.

*Roy Siegelmann,Enrique Mallada*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出一种基于非参数链策略的数据驱动非线性系统实用稳定化方法，通过最近邻规则从存储数据中提取有限时长控制信号，仅需系统局部Lipschitz假设，无需显式构造Lyapunov函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将系统建模为线性、多项式或多项式分式，限制了应用范围。本文旨在开发一种仅需局部Lipschitz假设的数据驱动稳定化方法，提供可证明的保证。

Method: 采用非参数链策略(NCPs)，使用归一化最近邻规则从存储数据中分配有限时长控制信号。引入递归控制Lyapunov函数(R-CLFs)框架，用于证明NCP能够实用稳定任意小的c邻域平衡点。

Result: 提供了明确的样本复杂度保证O((3/rho)^d log(R/c))，其中R为域半径，d为状态维度，rho为系统相关常数。非参数特性允许新验证数据轻松整合到策略中，改善收敛速度或扩大认证区域。

Conclusion: 所提出的链策略是非参数的，能够实用稳定非线性系统，数值实验验证了方法的有效性。该方法仅需局部Lipschitz假设，比现有方法更具普适性。

Abstract: We propose a method for data-driven practical stabilization of nonlinear
systems with provable guarantees, based on the concept of Nonparametric Chain
Policies (NCPs). The approach employs a normalized nearest-neighbor rule to
assign, at each state, a finite-duration control signal derived from stored
data, after which the process repeats. Unlike recent works that model the
system as linear, polynomial, or polynomial fraction, we only assume the system
to be locally Lipschitz. Our analysis builds on the framework of Recurrent
Lyapunov Functions (RLFs), which enable data-driven certification of practical
stability using standard norm functions instead of requiring the explicit
construction of a classical Lyapunov function. To extend this framework, we
introduce the concept of Recurrent Control Lyapunov Functions (R-CLFs), which
can certify the existence of an NCP that practically stabilizes an arbitrarily
small c-neighborhood of an equilibrium point. We also provide an explicit
sample complexity guarantee of O((3/rho)^d log(R/c)) number of trajectories,
where R is the domain radius, d the state dimension, and rho a system-dependent
constant. The proposed Chain Policies are nonparametric, thus allowing new
verified data to be readily incorporated into the policy to either improve
convergence rate or enlarge the certified region. Numerical experiments
illustrate and validate these properties.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合交通边界控制和信号控制的综合策略，通过分层多目标优化和分布式ADMM算法来缓解城市交通网络拥堵。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决城市交通网络拥堵问题，需要综合考虑边界流量控制和内部信号协调，但传统方法难以处理大规模网络的复杂性和计算负担。

Method: 采用分层多目标优化框架，首先优化边界流入量，然后协调内部信号配时；使用MPC确保安全约束，并通过ADMM算法实现分布式求解。

Result: VISSIM和MATLAB数值仿真表明，该策略能有效改善整体交通状况，提高网络容量并确保运行平稳。

Conclusion: 该综合控制策略通过分布式优化方法成功解决了大规模城市交通网络的拥堵问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive strategy that integrates traffic
perimeter control with traffic signal control to alleviate congestion in an
urban traffic network (UTN). The strategy is formulated as a lexicographic
multi-objective optimization problem, starting with the regulation of traffic
inflows at boundary junctions to maximize the capacity while ensuring a smooth
operation of the UTN. Following this, the signal timings at internal junctions
are collaboratively optimized to enhance overall traffic conditions under the
regulated inflows. The use of a model predictive control (MPC) approach ensures
that the control solution adheres to safety and capacity constraints within the
network. To address the computational complexity of the problem, the UTN is
divided into subnetworks, each managed by a local agent. A distributed solution
method based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm is employed, allowing each agent to determine its optimal control
decisions using local information from its subnetwork and neighboring agents.
Numerical simulations using VISSIM and MATLAB demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed traffic control strategy.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于协变量信息的多变量保形预测方法，为数据中心24/7无碳能源运营构建统计有效的自适应不确定性集合，相比传统方法可降低6.65%成本和6.96%碳基能源使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI应用快速增长导致数据中心能耗激增，加剧碳排放，需要向24/7无碳能源转型。传统优化方法在构建不确定性集合时未能充分利用预测模型的协变量信息，导致运营决策过于保守。

Method: 采用多变量保形预测技术，利用协变量信息构建统计有效且自适应的可再生能源预测不确定性集合，并将其直接应用于机会约束规划问题。

Conclusion: 该协变量感知方法能够有效推进数据中心实现24/7无碳能源运营，在保证统计可行性的同时显著提升运营效率。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI applications is dramatically increasing data center
energy demand, exacerbating carbon emissions, and necessitating a shift towards
24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE). Unlike traditional annual energy matching, 24/7
CFE requires matching real-time electricity consumption with clean energy
generation every hour, presenting significant challenges due to the inherent
variability and forecasting errors of renewable energy sources. Traditional
robust and data-driven optimization methods often fail to leverage the features
of the prediction model (also known as contextual or covariate information)
when constructing the uncertainty set, leading to overly conservative
operational decisions. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for 24/7
CFE data center operation scheduling, focusing on robust decision-making under
renewable generation uncertainty. This framework leverages covariate
information through a multi-variable conformal prediction (CP) technique to
construct statistically valid and adaptive uncertainty sets for renewable
forecasts. The uncertainty sets directly inform the chance-constrained
programming (CCP) problem, ensuring that chance constraints are met with a
specified probability. We further establish theoretical underpinnings
connecting the CP-generated uncertainty sets to the statistical feasibility
guarantees of the CCP. Numerical results highlight the benefits of this
covariate-aware approach, demonstrating up to 6.65% cost reduction and 6.96%
decrease in carbon-based energy usage compared to conventional
covariate-independent methods, thereby enabling data centers to progress toward
24/7 CEF.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合图神经网络和隐式Z-Bus递归方法的混合框架，用于解决交流潮流问题，在保持数据驱动模型速度的同时实现分析求解器的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交流潮流问题需要在数据驱动模型的速度和分析求解器的可靠性之间进行权衡，现有方法难以同时满足这两个需求。

Method: 使用物理信息图神经网络进行快速初始预测，通过两阶段触发器识别压力情况，并调用IZR求解器作为故障保护机制。

Result: 在IEEE 33总线系统的7500个压力场景测试中，纯GNN模型失败率为13.11%，而混合框架通过将所有潜在故障委托给IZR求解器，实现了0.00%的失败率。

Conclusion: 该混合方法展示了在保持分析求解器经验可靠性的同时利用GNN速度的实用路径，显著增加了近实时可分析场景的数量。

Abstract: The Alternating Current Power Flow (ACPF) problem forces a trade-off between
the speed of data-driven models and the reliability of analytical solvers. This
paper introduces a hybrid framework that synergizes a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) with the Implicit Z-Bus Recursive (IZR) method, a robust, non-iterative
solver for radial distribution networks. The framework employs a
physics-informed GNN for rapid initial predictions and invokes the IZR solver
as a failsafe for stressed cases identified by a two-stage trigger. A failure
is defined as any solution with a maximum power mismatch exceeding 0.1 p.u., a
significant operational deviation. On a challenging test set of 7,500 stressed
scenarios for the IEEE 33-bus system, the GNN-only model failed on 13.11 % of
cases. In contrast, the hybrid framework identified all potential failures,
delegating them to the IZR solver to achieve a 0.00 % failure rate, empirically
matching the 100 % success rate of the analytical solver on this specific test
set. An expanded ablation study confirms that both physics-informed training
and Z-bus sensitivity features are critical, collaboratively reducing the GNN's
failure rate from 98.72 % (data-only) to 13.11 %. The hybrid approach
demonstrates a pragmatic path to achieving the empirical reliability of an
analytical solver while leveraging GNN speed, enabling a significant increase
in the number of scenarios analyzable in near real-time.

Conclusion: 该方法将事故分析从预定义场景筛选转变为主动无监督筛选，能够更高效地识别电力系统的最坏风险场景。

Abstract: Contingency screening is a crucial part of electric power systems all the
time. Power systems frequently encounter multiple challenging operational
dilemmas that could lead to the instability of power systems. Contingency
analysis is effort-consuming by utilizing traditional numerical analysis
methods. It is commonly addressed by generating a whopping number of possible
contingencies or manipulating network parameters to determine the worst
scenarios. This paper proposes a novel approach that diverts the nature of
contingency analysis from pre-defined scenario screening to
proactive-unsupervised screening. The potentially risky scenarios of power
systems are generated from learning how the previous ones occurred. In other
words, the internal perturbation that initiates contingencies is learned prior
to being self-replicated for rendering the worst scenarios. By leveraging the
perturbation diffusion technique, a proposed model is built to point out the
worst scenarios instead of repeatedly simulating one-by-one scenarios to define
the highest-risk ones. Empirical experiments are implemented on the IEEE
systems to test and validate the proposed solution.

Abstract: District heating networks are an integral part of the energy system in many
countries. In future smart energy systems, they are expected to enhance energy
flexibility and support the integration of renewable and waste energy sources.
An important aspect of these networks is the control of flow rates, which
dictates the heat delivered to consumers. This paper concerns the properties of
flow rates in tree-structured district heating networks. We show that under
mild assumptions of monotonicity in the hydraulic network components,
statements regarding the stationary flow rate distribution can be made. In
particular, when all consumers in a network incrementally open their valves, an
increase in total flow rate throughput is guaranteed, while if one consumer
does not open their valve when others do, they will receive a reduced flow
rate. These properties are illustrated numerically on a small 2-consumer
network as well as on a larger 22-consumer network. Previous works have shown
that these properties allow the design and use of efficient control strategies
for optimal heat distribution.

through the automatic differentiation of PINNs, to apply model predictive
control using a cost function based on tracking error and control inputs. By
optimizing PINNs-based PID gains, the method achieves adaptive gain tuning that
ensures stability while accounting for system nonlinearities. The proposed
method features a systematic framework for integrating PINNs-based models of
dynamical control systems into closed-loop control systems, enabling direct
application to PID control design. A series of numerical experiments is
conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method from the
control perspectives based on both time and frequency domains.

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the problem of synthesizing property-enforcing
supervisors for partially-observed discrete-event systems (DES). Unlike most
existing approaches, where the enforced property depends solely on the executed
behavior of the system, here we consider a more challenging scenario in which
the property relies on predicted future behaviors that have not yet occurred.
This problem arises naturally in applications involving future information,
such as active prediction or intention protection. To formalize the problem, we
introduce the notion of prediction-based properties, a new class of
observational properties tied to the system's future information. We
demonstrate that this notion is very generic and can model various practical
properties, including predictability in fault prognosis and pre-opacity in
intention security. We then present an effective approach for synthesizing
supervisors that enforce prediction-based properties. Our method relies on a
novel information structure that addresses the fundamental challenge arising
from the dependency between current predictions and the control policy. The key
idea is to first borrow information from future instants and then ensure
information consistency. This reduces the supervisor synthesis problem to a
safety game in the information space. We prove that the proposed algorithm is
both sound and complete, and the resulting supervisor is maximally permissive.

Abstract: Therapist-in-the-loop robotic rehabilitation has shown great promise in
enhancing rehabilitation outcomes by integrating the strengths of therapists
and robotic systems. However, its broader adoption remains limited due to
insufficient safe interaction and limited adaptation capability. This article
proposes a novel telerobotics-mediated framework that enables therapists to
intuitively and safely deliver assist-as-needed~(AAN) therapy based on two
primary contributions. First, our framework encodes the therapist-informed
corrective force into via-points in a latent space, allowing the therapist to
provide only minimal assistance while encouraging patient maintaining own
motion preferences. Second, a shape-adaptive ANN rehabilitation policy is
learned to partially and progressively deform the reference trajectory for
movement therapy based on encoded patient motion preferences and
therapist-informed via-points. The effectiveness of the proposed shape-adaptive
AAN strategy was validated on a telerobotic rehabilitation system using two
representative tasks. The results demonstrate its practicality for remote AAN
therapy and its superiority over two state-of-the-art methods in reducing
corrective force and improving movement smoothness.

Abstract: Control of the density profile based on pellet fueling for the ITER nuclear
fusion tokamak involves a multi-rate nonlinear system with safety-critical
constraints, input delays, and discrete actuators with parametric uncertainty.
To address this challenging problem, we propose a multi-stage MPC (msMPC)
approach to handle uncertainty in the presence of mixed-integer inputs. While
the scenario tree of msMPC accounts for uncertainty, it also adds complexity to
an already computationally intensive mixed-integer MPC (MI-MPC) problem. To
achieve real-time density profile controller with discrete pellets and
uncertainty handling, we systematically reduce the problem complexity by (1)
reducing the identified prediction model size through dynamic mode
decomposition with control, (2) applying principal component analysis to reduce
the number of scenarios needed to capture the parametric uncertainty in msMPC,
and (3) utilizing the penalty term homotopy for MPC (PTH-MPC) algorithm to
reduce the computational burden caused by the presence of mixed-integer inputs.
We compare the performance and safety of the msMPC strategy against a nominal
MI-MPC in plant simulations, demonstrating the first predictive density control
strategy with uncertainty handling, viable for real-time pellet fueling in
ITER.

Abstract: This paper presents a new multi-query motion planning algorithm for linear
Gaussian systems with the goal of reaching a Euclidean ball with high
probability. We develop a new formulation for ball-shaped ambiguity sets of
Gaussian distributions and leverage it to develop a distributionally robust
belief roadmap construction algorithm. This algorithm synthe- sizes robust
controllers which are certified to be safe for maximal size ball-shaped
ambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions. Our algorithm achieves better
coverage than the maximal coverage algorithm for planning over Gaussian
distributions [1], and we identify mild conditions under which our algorithm
achieves strictly better coverage. For the special case of no process noise or
state constraints, we formally prove that our algorithm achieves maximal
coverage. In addition, we present a second multi-query motion planning
algorithm for linear Gaussian systems with the goal of reaching a region
parameterized by the Minkowski sum of an ellipsoid and a Euclidean ball with
high probability. This algorithm plans over ellipsoidal sets of maximal size
ball-shaped ambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions, and provably achieves
equal or better coverage than the best-known algorithm for planning over
ellipsoidal ambiguity sets of Gaussian distributions [2]. We demonstrate the
efficacy of both methods in a wide range of conditions via extensive simulation
experiments.

Motivation: 为了解决非线性系统远程状态估计中的通信效率问题，减少不必要的测量数据传输，同时保证估计性能。

Method: 采用事件触发机制，仅在触发事件时传输单个测量值并求解非线性MHE优化问题；未触发时使用系统动力学的开环预测更新状态估计；引入新的事件触发规则和可变水平长度。

Result: 在满足适当可检测性条件下，证明了ET-MHE方案的鲁棒全局指数稳定性；采用可变水平长度可获得更紧的估计误差界；通过两个示例验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的ET-MHE方案在减少通信量的同时保持了良好的估计性能，为非线性系统的远程状态估计提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an event-triggered moving horizon estimation
(ET-MHE) scheme for the remote state estimation of general nonlinear systems.
In the presented method, whenever an event is triggered, a single measurement
is transmitted and the nonlinear MHE optimization problem is subsequently
solved. If no event is triggered, the current state estimate is updated using
an open-loop prediction based on the system dynamics. Moreover, we introduce a
novel event-triggering rule under which we demonstrate robust global
exponential stability of the ET-MHE scheme, assuming a suitable detectability
condition is met. In addition, we show that with the adoption of a varying
horizon length, a tighter bound on the estimation error can be achieved.
Finally, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through two
illustrative examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 首先使用子集模拟的新公式确定最大可行备用容量，然后考虑显性成本和机会成本来表征供应曲线。

Conclusion: 该方法旨在支持虚拟电厂管理者制定市场策略和政策制定者设计面向分布式能源资源的辅助服务产品。

Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable energy sources is expected to drive
higher demand for power reserve ancillary services (AS). One solution is to
increase the supply by integrating distributed energy resources (DERs) into the
AS market through virtual power plants (VPPs). Several methods have been
developed to assess the potential of VPPs to provide services. However, the
existing approaches fail to account for AS products' requirements (reliability
and technical specifications) and to provide accurate cost estimations. Here,
we propose a new method to assess VPPs' potential to deliver power reserve
capacity products under forecasting uncertainty. First, the maximum feasible
reserve quantity is determined using a novel formulation of subset simulation
for efficient uncertainty quantification. Second, the supply curve is
characterized by considering explicit and opportunity costs. The method is
applied to a VPP based on a representative Swiss low-voltage network with a
diversified DER portfolio. We find that VPPs can reliably offer reserve
products and that opportunity costs drive product pricing. Additionally, we
show that the product's requirements strongly impact the reserve capacity
provision capability. This approach aims to support VPP managers in developing
market strategies and policymakers in designing DER-focused AS products.

*Junfeng Cai,Marco Lovera*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于双系统垂直起降无人机过渡飞行的新型主动容错控制方案，该方案由基准控制律和在线控制重分配模块组成，能够处理执行器故障并避免控制抖动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的滑模控制方法存在控制抖动问题，且在执行器故障时系统性能会显著下降，需要开发更可靠的容错控制方案来提升双系统VTOL无人机过渡飞行的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 采用结构化H∞基准控制律保证闭环系统稳定性，结合在线控制分配模块根据故障信息和实时空速更新控制分配矩阵，将虚拟控制信号重新分配给剩余健康执行器。

Result: 仿真结果表明，基于结构化H∞的AFTC系统能够处理更复杂的故障场景和模型不确定性，无需重新配置基准控制律，显著提高了过渡飞行的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 所提出的AFTC方案通过结构化H∞控制和在线控制重分配的有效结合，为双系统VTOL无人机提供了强大的容错能力，在对称和非对称执行器故障情况下均能保持良好性能。

Abstract: A novel active fault-tolerant control (AFTC) scheme for a dual-system
vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) during
transition flight is proposed in this paper. The AFTC scheme is composed of a
baseline control law and an online control reallocation module. First, the
structured $H_{\infty}$ baseline control law is able to guarantee the stability
of closed-loop systems without being reconfigured under simultaneous actuator
fault conditions. Second, compared to the existing mainstream method of sliding
mode control that is a discontinuous control strategy, the AFTC scheme can
effectively avoid control chattering problem by adopting the structured
$H_{\infty}$ baseline control law. Third, an online control allocation (CA)
module is implemented to carry out a unified CA for all the available
actuators. When actuator faults/failures occur, the CA matrix is updated
according to fault information and real-time airspeed, which is able to
redistribute the virtual control signals to the remaining healthy actuators,
avoiding significant performance degradation. Based on the developed AFTC
scheme, symmetric and non-symmetric actuator fault scenarios are simulated on a
nonlinear six-degree-of-freedom simulator, where the cases of merely structured
$H_{\infty}$ control and structured $H_{\infty}$ based AFTC are compared and
analyzed. The results show that the proposed structured $H_{\infty}$ based AFTC
system is capable of handling more complicated fault scenarios and model
uncertainties with no need to reconfigure the baseline control law. The
proposed AFTC scheme significantly improves the safety and reliability of the
transition flight of dual-system VTOL UAVs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种MPC引导的强化学习方法，结合了模型预测控制和强化学习的优势，用于欧洲不平衡市场的电池控制问题，相比单独使用RL或MPC分别实现了16.15%和54.36%的套利利润提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲不平衡市场中，传统的MPC策略虽然能捕捉套利机会，但无法准确模拟价格形成过程且计算成本高；而模型无关的RL方法执行速度快但需要大量数据训练。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出MPC引导的RL方法，结合MPC能够有效整合预测信息的能力和RL快速推理的优势，在比利时2023年平衡数据上进行评估。

Result: 与单独使用RL和MPC相比，提出的MPC引导RL方法分别实现了16.15%和54.36%的套利利润提升。

Conclusion: MPC引导的RL方法成功结合了两种方法的互补优势，在不平衡市场电池控制问题上表现出色，显著提升了套利利润。

Abstract: In Europe, profit-seeking balance responsible parties can deviate in real
time from their day-ahead nominations to assist transmission system operators
in maintaining the supply-demand balance. Model predictive control (MPC)
strategies to exploit these implicit balancing strategies capture arbitrage
opportunities, but fail to accurately capture the price-formation process in
the European imbalance markets and face high computational costs. Model-free
reinforcement learning (RL) methods are fast to execute, but require
data-intensive training and usually rely on real-time and historical data for
decision-making. This paper proposes an MPC-guided RL method that combines the
complementary strengths of both MPC and RL. The proposed method can effectively
incorporate forecasts into the decision-making process (as in MPC), while
maintaining the fast inference capability of RL. The performance of the
proposed method is evaluated on the implicit balancing battery control problem
using Belgian balancing data from 2023. First, we analyze the performance of
the standalone state-of-the-art RL and MPC methods from various angles, to
highlight their individual strengths and limitations. Next, we show an
arbitrage profit benefit of the proposed MPC-guided RL method of 16.15% and
54.36%, compared to standalone RL and MPC.

Motivation: 为地月空间导航提供不依赖局部线性化的鲁棒估计方法，利用被动光学测量实现自主导航

Method: 将CR3BP动力学和纯角度光学测量嵌入LFT表示，主要非线性表示为结构化实不确定性，通过视线几何重建地月距离进行测量加权

Result: 仿真显示估计误差有界，位置跟踪平滑，最大偏差出现在平面外状态，适用于近直线晕轨道导航

Conclusion: 该框架能够使用飞行代表性传感器实现有界估计误差的鲁棒机载导航

Abstract: This paper develops a robust estimation framework for cislunar navigation
that embeds the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) dynamics and
bearing-only optical measurements within a Linear Fractional Transformation
(LFT) representation. A full-order $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ observer is synthesized
with explicit $\mathcal{L}_2$ performance bounds. The formulation yields a
nonlinear estimator that operates directly on the governing equations and
avoids reliance on local linearizations. Dominant nonlinearities are expressed
as structured real uncertainties, while measurement fidelity is represented
through range-dependent weighting with Earth-Moon distances reconstructed from
line-of-sight geometry. The sensing architecture assumes passive
star-tracker-class optical instruments, eliminating the need for time-of-flight
ranging or precision clocks. Simulations demonstrate bounded estimation errors
and smooth position tracking over multiple orbital periods, with the largest
deviations observed in the out-of-plane states, consistent with the stiffness
of the vertical dynamics and the limitations of angle-only observability.
Application to a Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) illustrates that the
framework can achieve robust onboard navigation with bounded estimation errors
with flight-representative sensors.

Conclusion: 该控制器合成方法仅依赖于商业仿真套件中的经典环路整形工具，可直接应用于工业规模项目。

Abstract: The displacement of synchronous generators by converter-interfaced renewable
energy sources obliges wind farms to provide inertia, damping, and voltage
support, above all in increasingly weak grid conditions. This paper presents a
co-ordinated frequency-domain methodology for tuning all control layers of
doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) within a wind farm operated as a
Virtual Synchronous Machine (VSM). Starting from a full small-signal
linearisation that preserves loop-to-loop and machine-to-machine couplings, the
procedure reshapes every local open loop to explicit phase-margin targets
through a single, prioritised iteration. The resulting controllers provide a
step response and stability margins close to those programmed at the design
stage, in spite of the cross coupling between control loops. Since controller
synthesis relies exclusively on classical loop-shaping tools available in
commercial simulation suites, it is readily applicable to industrial-scale
projects.
