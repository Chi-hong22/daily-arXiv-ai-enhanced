The study also addresses the limitations of transferring\nautomotive automation technologies to railways and the need for a\nrailway-specific causation model to better evaluate and enhance safety in an\nevolving technological landscape. This study aims to bridge thegap between\ncontemporary research and practical applications, contributing to the\ndevelopment of more effective safety metrics."}

Manuscript accepted at the 2025 IEEE 21st\n  International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering (CASE 2025)", "summary": "Designing industrial systems, such as building, improving, and automating\ndistribution centers and manufacturing plants, involves critical\ndecision-making with limited information in the early phases. The lack of\ninformation leads to less accurate designs of the systems, which are often\ndifficult to resolve later. It is effective to use simulators to model the\ndesigned system and find out the issues early. However, the modeling time\nrequired by conventional simulators is too long to allow for rapid model\ncreation to meet decision-making demands. In this paper, we propose a Rapid\nModeling Architecture (RMA) for a lightweight industrial simulator that\nmitigates the modeling burden while maintaining the essential details in order\nto accelerate and improve decision-making. We have prototyped a simulator based\non the RMA and applied it to the actual factory layout design problem. We also\ncompared the modeling time of our simulator to that of an existing simulator,\nand as a result, our simulator achieved a 78.3% reduction in modeling time\ncompared to conventional simulators."}

This\nsensitivity to item positioning in a LLM's prompt is known as position bias.\nPrior research shows that this bias exists even in large models, though its\nseverity varies across models and tasks. In addition to position bias, LLMs\nalso exhibit varying degrees of low repetition consistency, where repeating the\nLLM call with the same candidate ordering can lead to different rankings. To\naddress both inconsistencies, a common approach is to prompt the model multiple\ntimes with different candidate orderings and aggregate the results via majority\nvoting. However, this repetition strategy, significantly increases\ncomputational costs. Extending prior findings, we observe that both the\ndirection -- favoring either the earlier or later candidate in the prompt --\nand magnitude of position bias across instances vary substantially, even within\na single dataset. This observation highlights the need for a per-instance\nmitigation strategy. To this end, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping method\nthat adaptively determines the number of repetitions required for each\ninstance.

In existing studies, response onset relies on manual\nannotation or vehicle control signals such as accelerator and brake pedal\nmovements. These methods are not applicable when analyzing large scale data\nwhere vehicle control signals are not available. This holds in particular for\nthe rapidly expanding sets of ADS log data where the behavior of surrounding\nroad users is observed via onboard sensors. To advance evaluation techniques\nfor ADS and enable measuring response timing when vehicle control signals are\nnot available, we developed a simple and efficient algorithm, based on a\npiecewise linear acceleration model, to automatically estimate brake onset that\ncan be applied to any type of driving data that includes vehicle longitudinal\ntime series data. We also proposed a manual annotation method to identify brake\nonset and used it as ground truth for validation. R2 was used as a confidence\nmetric to measure the accuracy of the algorithm, and its classification\nperformance was analyzed using naturalistic collision avoidance data of both\nADS and humans, where our method was validated against human manual annotation.\nAlthough our algorithm is subject to certain limitations, it is efficient,\ngeneralizable, applicable to any road user and scenario types, and is highly\nconfigurable."}

In practice, however, a\nreactor's operational flexibility is closely tied to it's fuel cycle stage and\nthe associated reactivity margin. A key physical constraint to power\nmaneuverability is xenon poisoning, caused by an increase in neutron absorbing\nxenon concentration following a power ramp down. This can delay or even prevent\nsubsequent power ramp up due to suppressed core reactivity. Additionally, if a\nreactor is shutdown during periods of low reactivity, restart times can vary\nsignificantly due to these xenon transients, leading to longer downtimes. This\nwork introduces a physics informed, metaheuristic modeling approach that embeds\nfuel cycle dynamics directly with a unit commitment (UC) framework. The\nframework tracks reactivity margin, dynamically activates xenon related\nconstraints, and endogenously implements refueling outages based on the core\nconditions. By capturing intra-cycle reactivity evolution and the conditional\nonset of xenon poisoning, the formulation allows for operation dependent\nnuclear dispatch that reflects both regulatory limits and physical behavior.\nWhen applied to a representative reactor fleet operating in distinct modes of\noperation -- ranging from baseload to part load -- the framework reveals that\nflexible operation can slow reactivity degradation and extend fuel cycles. The\nresults show that fuel cycle aware flexibility modeling is critical for\naccurate scheduling of nuclear reactors and offers a tractable pathway to\nintegrate nuclear power in energy system models."}

In this paper, we propose a unified\nobserver framework for a class of linear observed systems by restricting a\nbi-invariant system on a Lie group to its normal subgroup. This structural\nproperty powerfully enables a system immersion of the original system into a\nlinear time-varying system. Leveraging the immersion, an observer is\nconstructed by first designing a Kalman-like observer for the immersed system\nand then reconstructing the group-valued state via optimization. Under a rank\ncondition, global exponential stability (GES) is achieved provided one global\noptimum of the reconstruction optimization is found, reflecting the topological\ndifficulties inherent to the non-Euclidean state space. Semi-global stability\nis guaranteed when input biases are jointly estimated. The theory is applied to\nthe GES observer design for two-frame systems, capable of modeling a family of\nnavigation problems.

To address these issues, we propose the\nMultimodal Fine-grained Topic-post Relational Reasoning (MFTRR) framework,\nwhich mimics human cognitive processes. MFTRR reframes post-quality assessment\nas a ranking task and incorporates multimodal data to better capture quality\nvariations. It consists of two key modules: (1) the Local-Global Semantic\nCorrelation Reasoning Module, which models fine-grained semantic interactions\nbetween posts and topics at both local and global levels, enhanced by a maximum\ninformation fusion mechanism to suppress noise; and (2) the Multi-Level\nEvidential Relational Reasoning Module, which explores macro- and micro-level\nrelational cues to strengthen evidence-based reasoning. We evaluate MFTRR on\nthree newly constructed multimodal topic-post datasets and the public\nLazada-Home dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that MFTRR significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 9.52% NDCG@3\nimprovement over the best unimodal method on the Art History dataset."}

To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.\nSimilar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is\nwell-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small\nmedical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and\nabsence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we\npropose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT\nrepresentations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our\nauxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various\nfrozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\\% using 100\\% and up to\n8.35\\% using only 10\\% of the training data."}

In this\npaper, we propose a novel deep learning approach for head pose estimation with\nlimited training data via non-linear manifold learning called NLML-HPE. This\nmethod is based on the combination of tensor decomposition (i.e., Tucker\ndecomposition) and feed forward neural networks. Unlike traditional\nclassification-based approaches, our method formulates head pose estimation as\na regression problem, mapping input landmarks into a continuous representation\nof pose angles. To this end, our method uses tensor decomposition to split each\nEuler angle (yaw, pitch, roll) to separate subspaces and models each dimension\nof the underlying manifold as a cosine curve. We address two key challenges: 1.\nAlmost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.\nHence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our\ntraining set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering\nthe corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited\ntraining data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an\nobject from facial landmarks.

The novelty of\nViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as\nit provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack\nspecificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically\ndivides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates\nthem for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.\nThrough the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency\ndomains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to\ndetect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText\nsignificantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost\nwhen it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise\nfrom 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's\nsuperior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable\ndiffusion models.

Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and\naccurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained\nMulti-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from\nhundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits\nand lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that\nintegrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping\nstrategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a\nglobal space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,\nwe formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic\nProcrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing\nprobabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain\ncorrespondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within\nminutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization\nframework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from\nconfidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering\nwith an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling\naccurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI\ndatasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed\nimage sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS\nreconstruction."}

Project page: https://thecinema.ai", "summary": "We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.\nGiven a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly\ngenerates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which\nensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,\nscenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.\nThese keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,\nwhich supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics\nbetween them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support\nstable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,\nwe introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion\nTransformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our\nmodel is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of\ninterleaved data pairs.

However, due to privacy concerns, certain sensitive\ndata can only be processed on edge devices. Therefore, employing\nQuantization-Aware Training (QAT) on edge devices has become an effective\nsolution. Nevertheless, traditional QAT relies on the complete dataset for\ntraining, which incurs a huge computational cost. Coreset selection techniques\ncan mitigate this issue by training on the most representative subsets.\nHowever, existing methods struggle to eliminate quantization errors in the\nmodel when using small-scale datasets (e.g., only 10% of the data), leading to\nsignificant performance degradation. To address these issues, we propose QuaRC,\na QAT framework with coresets on edge devices, which consists of two main\nphases: In the coreset selection phase, QuaRC introduces the ``Relative Entropy\nScore\" to identify the subsets that most effectively capture the model's\nquantization errors. During the training phase, QuaRC employs the Cascaded\nLayer Correction strategy to align the intermediate layer outputs of the\nquantized model with those of the full-precision model, thereby effectively\nreducing the quantization errors in the intermediate layers. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For instance, when\nquantizing ResNet-18 to 2-bit using a 1% data subset, QuaRC achieves a 5.72%\nimprovement in Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K dataset compared to\nstate-of-the-art techniques."}
