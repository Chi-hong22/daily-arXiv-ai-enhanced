TL;DR: 该论文首次系统综述了3D和4D世界建模领域，建立了标准定义和分类体系，填补了现有研究在三维和四维表示方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界建模研究主要关注2D图像和视频生成，忽视了快速发展的3D/4D表示方法（如RGB-D、占据网格、LiDAR点云），且缺乏标准定义和分类体系导致文献中的主张碎片化不一致。

Method: 建立了精确的定义体系，提出了结构化分类法（VideoGen视频生成、OccGen占据生成、LiDARGen激光雷达生成），系统总结了3D/4D专用数据集和评估指标。

Result: 提供了首个专门针对3D和4D世界建模与生成的全面综述，为领域发展提供了连贯的基础参考框架。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了世界建模领域的空白，建立了标准化框架，为推进3D/4D世界建模研究提供了重要基础和方向指引。

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of
existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/survey

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFloodNet是一个基于深度学习的城市洪水分类框架，通过多模态特征融合和分层注意力机制，在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统洪水检测方法依赖单模态数据和静态规则系统，无法捕捉洪水事件的动态非线性关系，现有注意力机制和集成学习方法在分层细化、跨模态特征整合和噪声适应性方面存在局限。

Method: 提出XFloodNet框架，包含三个核心组件：分层跨模态门控注意力机制、异构卷积自适应多尺度注意力模块、级联卷积Transformer特征细化技术，实现视觉和文本特征的动态对齐和多粒度交互。

Result: 在Chennai Floods、Rhine18 Floods和Harz17 Floods三个数据集上分别达到93.33%、82.24%和88.60%的F1分数，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: XFloodNet通过先进的深度学习技术重新定义了城市洪水分类，解决了传统方法的局限性，为可持续城市发展提供了有效的洪水检测解决方案。

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

### [3] [Video Parallel Scaling: Aggregating Diverse Frame Subsets for VideoLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08016)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) 是一种推理时方法，通过并行处理视频帧子集来扩展VideoLLMs的感知带宽，避免长上下文窗口带来的计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs在处理更多输入帧以捕捉细粒度时间细节时面临计算成本过高和长上下文导致的性能下降问题。

Method: VPS运行多个并行推理流，每个流处理视频帧的不同子集，然后聚合这些互补流的输出概率来整合更丰富的视觉信息。

Result: 在多个模型架构和规模(2B-32B)上的实验表明，VPS在Video-MME和EventHallusion等基准测试中持续显著提升性能，比Self-consistency等其他并行方法扩展性更好。

Conclusion: VPS提供了一个内存高效且鲁棒的框架，无需额外训练即可增强VideoLLMs的时间推理能力，是其他解码策略的有效补充。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: 多模态立场检测框架，通过大语言模型和图像描述生成器整合文本与视觉信息，在气候变化数据集上超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立场检测方法主要仅考虑文本数据，而社交媒体内容越来越多地结合文本和视觉元素，需要充分利用多模态信息的高级多模态方法

Method: 采用分层融合方法：使用大语言模型从源文本中提取立场相关摘要，用领域知识图像描述生成器在目标话题上解释视觉内容，通过专门的transformer模块共同建模文本和图像的交互作用

Result: 在MultiClimate数据集上达到准确率76.2%、精度76.3%、召回率76.2%和F1得76.2%，超越了现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 该多模态立场检测框架通过整合文本和视觉信息，能够更有效地处理现代社交媒体内容，在气候变化相关立场检测任务上表现优异

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Na\"ive Bayes), resulting in 15 different base learners. These are aggregated
via weighted averaging to classify regions as Car, Van, Truck, Bus, or
background. Hyperparameters are optimized with the whale optimization algorithm
to balance accuracy, precision, and recall. Implemented in MATLAB R2020b with
parallel processing, SI-EDTL outperforms existing methods on the AU-AIR UAV
dataset.

*Rafał Osadnik,Pablo Gómez,Eleni Bohacek,Rickbir Bahia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提供了一个新的火星数字高程模型预测数据集MCTED，包含80,898个样本，并通过小型U-Net模型证明了在该数据集上训练的模型能够超过现有基础模型的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星数字高程模型预测任务中的数据缺乏问题，提供一个专门用于机器学习应用的高质量数据集，并减少原始数据中的伪弊和缺失数据点的影响。

Method: 使用火星重追踪过道器CTX仪器收集的高分辨率正弄图像和DEM数据，通过综合处理管道生成80,898个数据样本。每个样本包含光学图像补丁、DEM补丁和两个掩码补丁。将数据分为训练集和验证集，确保无数据泄漏。并在该数据集上训练小型U-Net模型进行性能测试。

Conclusion: MCTED数据集为火星高程模型预测提供了丰富的训练数据，小型专门模型在该数据集上的表现超过大型基础模型，证明了领域特定数据集的重要性。数据集和代码已开源发布。

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

### [7] [APML: Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss for Robust 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08104)
*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Mohammad Sabokrou,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为APML（自适应概率匹配损失）的新型损失函数，用于点云预测任务，解决了传统Chamfer距离和EMD的局限性，实现了可微分的一对一匹配近似，具有接近二次方的计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点云预测损失函数（如Chamfer距离、HyperCD、InfoCD）存在多对一对应关系问题，导致密集区域点拥堵和稀疏区域覆盖不足；而EMD虽然能强制一对一对应，但立方计算复杂度限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用Sinkhorn迭代在温度缩放的相似度矩阵上进行概率匹配，通过分析计算温度参数来保证最小分配概率，无需手动调参，实现了完全可微分的操作。

Result: 在ShapeNet基准测试和WiFi CSI到3D人体点云生成的时空Transformer上，APM损失实现了更快的收敛速度、更好的空间分布（特别是在低密度区域），以及相当或改进的定量性能。

Conclusion: APML损失函数提供了一种计算高效、可微分的一对一匹配近似方案，在多个点云预测任务中表现出优越性能，无需额外的超参数搜索。

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

*Jingjing Liu,Yinchao Han,Xianchao Xiu,Jianhua Zhang,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出L-RPCANet，一种基于RPCA的轻量级红外小目标检测框架，通过层次瓶颈结构和噪声抑制模块实现参数轻量化和噪声鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度展开网络在红外小目标检测中存在参数不够轻量和噪声鲁棒性不足的问题

Method: 构建层次瓶颈结构进行通道维度调整和特征精炼，嵌入噪声抑制模块增强鲁棒性，采用SENet通道注意力机制

Result: 在ISTD数据集上验证了优于RPCANet、DRPCANet、RPCANet++等先进方法的性能

Conclusion: L-RPCANet在保持轻量化和鲁棒性的同时实现了优异的检测性能

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

### [9] [Sparse Transformer for Ultra-sparse Sampled Video Compressive Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08228)
*Miao Cao,Siming Zheng,Lishun Wang,Ziyang Chen,David Brady,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了超稀疏采样(USS)策略和BSTFormer模型，通过降低数据采集耗能和提高动态范围来实现高效能的视频压缩成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率、高帧率摄像机的迅速增长的能耗问题，寻求更高能效的压缩采样方案。

Method: 提出USS稀疏采样策略，在每个空间位置只采样一个子帧，并设计BSTFormer模型利用局部块注意力、全局稀疏注意力和时间注意力来处理采样数据。

Result: 在模拟和实际数据上都显示该方法显著超过以往最优算法，并具有更高的动态范围和固定曝光时间的优势。

Conclusion: USS策略结合BSTFormer模型为高效能视频压缩成像提供了有效解决方案，适合芯片级实现，在低耗能高性能摄像领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法难以检测枪击、刺伤等致命事件，主要因为这些事件罕见且存在数据收集的伦理问题

Method: 使用GTA5游戏构建致命暴力视频数据集，包含多视角CCTV视频；提出基于Wasserstein对抗训练的片段级域适应策略，弥合合成数据与真实数据特征差距

Result: 实验验证了GTA-Crime数据集的有效性，结合域适应策略能持续提升真实世界致命暴力检测准确率

Conclusion: GTA-Crime为解决致命暴力检测的数据稀缺问题提供了可行方案，合成的游戏数据通过适当域适应可有效提升真实场景检测性能

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出RepViT-CXR方法，通过通道复制策略将单通道胸部X光图像适配到ViT架构，在TB和肺炎检测任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT架构通常需要三通道输入且基于自然图像预训练，而胸部X光图像是单通道灰度图像，存在输入格式不匹配的问题

Method: 使用通道复制策略将单通道CXR图像转换为ViT兼容的三通道格式，不引入额外信息损失

Result: 在TB-CXR数据集上达到99.9%准确率和AUC，在儿科肺炎数据集上达到99.0%准确率和99.0% AUC，在深圳TB数据集上达到91.1%准确率和91.2% AUC，均超越现有方法

Conclusion: 简单有效的通道复制策略能让ViT在灰度医学图像任务中充分发挥表征能力，为临床筛查系统部署展示了强大潜力

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多基于预训练或忽略脑部疾病引起的不对称特征，需要更好地捕捉AD引起的左右脑萎缩不对称性以提高诊断性能。

Method: 使用3D CNN编码器提取特征，通过网格块对齐操作对齐左右半球特征，然后输入对称交互Transformer(SIT)进行诊断分析，重点关注结构变化引起的不对称区域。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上达到92.5%的诊断准确率，优于多种CNN方法和CNN结合通用Transformer的方法，可视化结果显示网络更关注脑萎缩区域特别是AD引起的不对称病理特征。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效捕捉AD引起的脑结构不对称变化，提高诊断准确性并具有良好的可解释性，证明了对称交互Transformer在脑疾病诊断中的有效性。

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

Conclusion: EVDI++通过统一的自监督框架成功解决了视频去模糊和插值问题，利用事件相机的高时间分辨率特性，在真实世界应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

Motivation: 现有高光谱跟踪器无法有效捕捉内在光谱信息、时间依赖性和跨深度交互，需要新的方法来充分利用高光谱数据的丰富信息

Method: 提出HyMamba网络，包含光谱状态集成(SSI)模块和高光谱Mamba(HSM)模块，通过三个方向扫描的状态空间模块同步学习空间和光谱信息

Result: 在7个基准数据集上实现最先进性能，在HOTC2020数据集上达到73.0%的AUC分数和96.3%的DP@20分数

Conclusion: HyMamba通过统一建模光谱、跨深度和时间信息，有效解决了现有高光谱跟踪器的局限性，展现出优异的性能

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在处理需要关注图像特定细节的精确问题时，为何会表现出性能差异，并系统分析输入数据特征对模型行为的影响。

Method: 建立多维检测框架，分析图像和提示词的不同特征（如图像大小、物体数量、背景颜色、提示词特异性）对开源视觉语言模型注意力值变化的影响。

Result: 研究表明，即使是图像特征和提示词特异性的微小变化，也会导致视觉语言模型回答方式和整体性能的显著变化。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的行为对输入参数的细微变化非常敏感，需要开发更好的方法来表征和改善这种变化敏感性。

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

Conclusion: E3DPC-GZSL方法有效解决了3D点云零样本分割中的偏见预测问题，通过不确定性估计和语义空间优化显著提升了模型性能

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的弱监督物体检测方法存在三个主要问题：1）伪真实框要么只覆盖区别性部位覆盖不全，要么无法区分相邻的同类实例；2）WSDDN基础网络缺乏背景类表征且分支间语义差距大；3）忽略建议在优化中被丢弃，导致收敛慢。

Method: 提出了三个核心改进：1）热力图导向的建议选择算法（HGPS），利用双阈值预选建议，使伪真实框既能覆盖整个物体又能区分相邻实例；2）弱监督基础检测网络（WSBDN），为每个建议增加背景类表征，并使用热力图进行预监督来缩小语义差距；3）在忽略建议上应用负确定性监督损失，以加速收敛。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2007和2012数据集上进行了广泛实验，在VOC 2007上达到了58.5%的mAP和81.8%的mCorLoc，在VOC 2012上达到了55.6%的mAP和80.5%的mCorLoc，性能显著超过了现有的最先进弱监督物体检测方法。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了弱监督物体检测中的三个关键挑战，通过热力图导向的建议选择、改进的基础检测网络和负确定性监督损失，实现了更准确的物体检测和更快的收敛速度，在标准数据集上达到了独创性能水平。

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Oil palm cultivation remains one of the leading causes of deforestation in
Indonesia. To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable
mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory
frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm
plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert
labeling of high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 to 2024. The dataset
provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of
agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes
oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was
ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset
was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it
suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural
networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY
license, it fills a key gap in training data for remote sensing and aims to
improve the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent
monitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global
deforestation reduction goals and follows FAIR data principles.

Conclusion: SimCroP框架能有效捕捉稀疏放射影像中的关键病理结构，提升多尺度下游任务性能

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

Method: 提出BTS-EE顺序训练方法，逐分支训练和校准以对齐推理时数据分布；设计基于1D卷积的轻量分支架构和Class Precision Margin校准方法，支持每类阈值调优

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了CNN在实时图像处理系统中的部署设计空间，为工业检测、嵌入式视觉和无人机监控等应用提供实用效率增益

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a

mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

TL;DR: LD-ViCE是一个基于潜在扩散模型的视频反事实解释框架，通过潜在空间操作降低计算成本，生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，在三个视频数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频AI系统在安全关键领域应用广泛，但现有解释技术存在时间连贯性不足、鲁棒性差、缺乏可操作的因果洞察等问题，需要更好的解释方法来增强AI系统的可信度。

Method: 提出LD-ViCE框架，使用最先进的扩散模型在潜在空间中操作，通过额外的精炼步骤生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在EchoNet-Dynamic、FERV39k和Something-Something V2三个数据集上，LD-ViCE比现有最优方法R2分数提升高达68%，推理时间减少一半，生成语义有意义且时间连贯的解释。

Conclusion: LD-ViCE是向安全关键领域可信AI部署迈出的重要一步，能够为视频AI模型提供有价值的洞察，增强模型行为的可解释性。

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyperTTA是一个针对高光谱图像分类的鲁棒性增强框架，通过多退化数据集构建、光谱-空间Transformer分类器设计以及轻量级测试时自适应策略，有效应对各种现实退化场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类模型对噪声、模糊、压缩和大气效应等多种现实退化引起的分布偏移高度敏感，需要提升模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 构建多退化高光谱数据集；设计光谱-空间Transformer分类器（SSTC），包含多级感受野机制和标签平滑正则化；提出置信度感知的熵最小化LayerNorm适配器（CELA）进行轻量级测试时自适应。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，HyperTTA在各种退化场景下均优于现有基线方法，验证了其分类主干和TTA方案的有效性。

Conclusion: HyperTTA提供了一个统一的框架，能够有效增强高光谱图像分类模型在多样化退化条件下的鲁棒性，且无需源数据或目标标注即可实现动态自适应。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测个体化的高分辨率直视皮层厚度轨迹对于检测细微的皮层变化和提前干预神经退行性疾病至关重要，但由于大脑皮层的复杂非欧几里形状和多模态数据整合的需求，这一任务很具挑战性。

Method: 提出球面布朗威桥扩散模型(SBDM)，采用双向条件布朗威桥扩散过程来预测注册皮层表面顶点级别的CTh轨迹。技术创新包括新的去噪模型条件球面U-Net(CoS-UNet)，结合球面卷积和密集交叉注意力机制来无缝整合皮层表面和表格条件。

Result: 与之前方法相比，SBDM在ADNI和OASIS纵向数据集上实现了显著降低的预测误差。此外，SBDM还能够生成个体的事实和反事实CTh轨迹，为探索皮层发育的假设场景提供了新框架。

Conclusion: SBDM为皮层厚度预测提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够准确预测个体化的高分辨率CTh变化，并且具有生成反事实轨迹的能力，为神经退行性疾病的早期识别和干预提供了新的研究工具。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数基于Mamba的视觉模型主要关注网络架构和扫描路径，而很少关注SSM模块本身。为了探索SSM的潜力，需要改进SSM的计算过程。

Method: 引入一阶状态空间模型(FSSM)，在SSM中应用一阶保持条件，推导新的离散化形式，并分析累积误差，通过融入token相关性来提升性能。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，FSSM在不增加额外参数的情况下提升了MambaIR的性能，超越了当前的轻量级超分辨率方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FSSM通过改进SSM模块的计算过程，有效提升了轻量级超分辨率任务的性能，证明了SSM模块优化的重要性。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多视图互信息的自监督学习方法，用于解决不平衡数据集中的对比学习问题，通过引入超过两个视图的目标函数来改善尾部类别的特征表示，在多个不平衡数据集上取得了新的最优性能。


<details>

Motivation: 对比自监督学习(CSSL)在平衡数据集上表现良好，但在不平衡数据集上泛化能力较差。受Yann LeCun关于多视图框架可扩展到超过两个视图的启发，作者希望解决CSSL在不平衡数据集中的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 基于互信息理论提出超过两个视图的目标函数，通过区分类内和类间判别特征来提取尾部类别的代表性特征。引入新的损失函数来过滤极端特征，学习更好的表示。

Result: 在多种自监督框架(对比和非对比)上实验验证，该方法在不平衡数据集分类中取得了新的最优准确率：Cifar10-LT提升2%，Cifar100-LT提升5%，Imagenet-LT提升3%。

Conclusion: 多视图目标函数能有效改善自监督学习在不平衡数据集上的性能，通过更好的特征表示提取机制，特别是对尾部类别的处理，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

Conclusion: 提供了一种透明、可靠的现代视觉多模态模型集成模式，通过明确的安全护栏和运维实践提高了物体替换、场景增强和移除的可靠性

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

Method: 系统性分析海底物体检测的5大挑战类别，跟踪从传统图像处理到现代方法的发展进程，探索大型视觉-语言模型在海底检测中的应用潜力，包括使用DALL-E 3生成合成数据集和微调Florence-2模型

Result: 识别了三个关键发现：(i)现有UOD方法在处理图像逆逆和小物体检测方面仍不充分 (ii)LVLMs生成合成数据具有潜力但需更多精细化以确保真实性 (iii)LVLMs在UOD中应用前景广阔，但实时应用仍需深入研究

Conclusion: 大型视觉-语言模型为海底物体检测带来了新的解决方案，特别是在多模态处理和数据增强方面。未来需要进一步研究优化技术以实现实时应用，并提高合成数据的真实性和适用性

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成紧凑但时间敏感的视频表示，在手性动作识别任务上表现出色，并能增强现有视频模型的性能。

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

Conclusion: MESH提供了一个有效且全面的视频幻觉识别方法，能够系统评估大型视频模型的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

Result: ViewSparsifier方法在ACM Multimedia 2025的Growth Modelling挑战赛中赢得了植物年龄预测和叶片计数估计两个任务

Conclusion: 多视角学习方法能有效提升植物表型分析性能，随机视角选择策略是未来研究的有价值方向

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

Result: 在格陵兰三个子区域的应用中，GraphTopoNet比插值、卷积和图基线方法表现更好，误差减少高达60%，同时保留了精细尺度的冰川特征。

Conclusion: GraphTopoNet展示了图机器学习如何将稀疏、不确定的地球物理观测转化为大陆尺度的可操作知识，提高了操作建模的可靠性，支持气候预测和政策制定。

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent
while preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve
reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate
forecasting and policy. More broadly, GraphTopoNet shows how graph machine
learning can convert sparse, uncertain geophysical observations into actionable
knowledge at continental scale.

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著减少医学3D分割中的人工工作量，提高分割效率，特别是在复杂医学图像分析任务中

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain
reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

Motivation: 多模态眼科图像数据获取成本高，OCT数据有限且模态不平衡，传统方法无法抓取细粒度空间信息。

Result: 在9个多样化数据集上的28个关键类别中，该框架超越了现有标准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态数据不平衡问题，在仅使用成本低廉的本底照时仍能利用OCT空间前知提升识别性能。

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 扩散模型在数据稀缺领域面临挑战，需要大量重新训练或昂贵的配对数据。为了解决这些限制，需要一种能够利用部分配对数据有效弥合域差距的方法。

Method: 通过在共享潜在空间中对齐源域和目标域分布，将预训练的源域扩散模型与目标域潜在对齐扩散模型（LADM）集成，利用部分配对的潜在表示进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明在部分监督下的深度到图像转换任务中表现出优越性能，并且能够扩展到多源转换和多目标转换任务。

Conclusion: LADB为现实世界域转换提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案，特别适用于数据标注成本高或不完整的场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

Conclusion: DSLNet通过分离建模手势的形态和轨迹特征，有效解决了手语识别中的几何模糊问题，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the
challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with
significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

Motivation: 传统光流估计方法需要大量标注数据，而真实标注成本高昂。本文旨在开发无需真实标注的无监督方法，利用分形几何和自相似性原理来捕捉精细细节和长距离运动模式。

Method: 采用分形变形网络(FDN)架构，递归编码器-解码器结构配合跳跃连接，结合L1和L2数据保真度项以及总变差(TV)正则化，通过变分公式最小化能量函数来实现亮度恒定和空间平滑。

Conclusion: FractalPINN-Flow提供了一个有效的无监督光流估计解决方案，通过分形几何启发的网络结构和经典变分公式的结合，在缺乏标注数据的情况下仍能获得高质量的光流估计结果。

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)
techniques and their transformative impact on computer vision (CV)
applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity

analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,
challenges, and future research directions. We emphasize the potential for
task-specific, adaptive imaging pipelines that improve robustness, accuracy,

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are

TL;DR: 提出MMB方法，通过贝叶斯提示集成和图像聚类改进多模态大语言模型对文本到图像生成系统的评估，解决偏见和校准问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在评估文本到图像生成系统时存在偏见、过度自信和跨域性能不一致的问题，标准提示集成方法在多模态任务中效果不佳

Method: 提出多模态贝叶斯提示集成方法(MMB)，结合贝叶斯提示集成和图像聚类，根据图像视觉特征动态分配提示权重

Result: 在HPSv2和MJBench基准测试中，MMB在配对偏好判断准确性和校准方面优于现有基线，与人类标注更一致

Conclusion: 多模态特定策略对评估校准至关重要，MMB为可靠的大规模文本到图像评估提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

Conclusion: 该框架证明了深度学习在基于移动图像进行无侵入、可访问和可解释的碳中毒诊断中的潜力。通过提供可靠的图像筛查，可以在皮肤科医生缺乏的农村和资源有限社区作为实用诊断辅助工具，支持早期发现和及时干预

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的事件相机星迹踪研究缺乏准确的真实值数据，需要一种可靠的方法来验证其定向精度

Method: 将静止的事件相机通过地面望远镜指向夜空，利用地球自转作为唯一的相机运动来生成事件流，并与IERS测量的地球方位进行对比

Result: 系统实现了18.47秒的根均方锐差和78.84秒的绝对锐差，显示了事件相机在星迹踪中的可行性

Conclusion: 事件相机具有计算效率高、动态范围广、能耗低、更新速度快等优势，经验证的精度水平表明其适合用于低成本低延迟的星迹踪应用

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

TL;DR: BEAMER提出了一种新的密集图像匹配方法，通过在每个尺度为每个源位置预测多个对应假设而非单一假设，显著提升了在深度不连续和强缩放情况下的匹配鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在每个尺度为每个源位置只产生单一对应假设，在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像强缩放等挑战性情况下容易产生错误匹配。

Method: 采用beam search策略在每个尺度传播多个假设，并将这些多假设集成到交叉注意力层中，构建了BEAMER密集匹配架构。

Result: BEAMER能够学习在多个尺度间保持和传播多个假设，相比最先进方法显著提升了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 多假设预测策略有效解决了密集图像匹配中的挑战性问题，特别是在深度不连续和强缩放场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概率生成模型在文本驱动视频生成中存在随机性导致的不可预测伪影（如不可能的物理现象和时间不一致性），但现有数据集主要关注图像生成，缺乏针对视频时空复杂性的系统基准。

Method: 构建大规模人工标注数据集GeneVA，专注于视频生成中的时空伪影，包含丰富的自然文本提示和对应的人类标注。

Result: 成功创建了GeneVA数据集，填补了视频生成伪影评估的空白。

Conclusion: GeneVA数据集能够支持和辅助关键应用，如基准测试模型性能和提升生成视频质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

TL;DR: RewardDance是一个可扩展的视觉生成奖励建模框架，通过生成式奖励范式解决现有方法的局限性，支持模型规模扩展到260亿参数，并有效解决了奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在视觉生成中存在架构限制和Bradley-Terry损失与VLM不匹配的问题，且RLHF优化过程存在奖励黑客问题，阻碍了有效的规模化。

Method: 提出RewardDance框架，将奖励分数重新定义为模型预测"yes"标记的概率，表明生成图像优于参考图像，从而内在对齐奖励目标与VLM架构。

Result: 在文本到图像、文本到视频和图像到视频生成任务中显著超越最先进方法，大规模奖励模型在RL微调期间保持高奖励方差，证明其抗黑客攻击能力。

Conclusion: RewardDance通过生成式奖励范式成功解决了奖励模型规模化问题，缓解了模式崩溃问题，为视觉生成任务的强化学习提供了有效的奖励建模解决方案。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Motivation: 解决单目视频中三维动态场景重建的挑战，特别是针对织物材料的深度模糊问题，实现高质量的几何重建和外观估计。

Method: 结合物理布料模拟和可微分渲染，引入两个新的正则化项来处理单目视频中的深度模糊问题，仅需单目RGB视频作为输入。

Result: 3D重建误差比现有方法降低了2.64倍，每个场景平均运行时间30分钟，能够从单目视频中恢复出锐利的细节信息。

Conclusion: 该方法在单目视频的织物3D重建和外观估计方面取得了显著改进，为解决深度模糊问题提供了有效解决方案，实现了高质量的物理渲染效果。

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

TL;DR: 上下文矩阵作为一种新的人际动态表征方法，统一了同步性和方向性影响两个维度，能够揭示团队中个体间的相互作用机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有人际动态测量方法如CRQA、相关性、Granger因果性等只能捐捕单一维度（同步性或影响方向），需要一种统一两者的心理学意义表征方法。

Method: 提出上下文矩阵作为线性动态系统中的过渡矩阵，用于描述个体当前行为如何受自己和其他成员过去行为的影响。开发了序贫贝叶斯模型来从时间序列数据中推断上下文矩阵。

Result: 模型在噪声模拟中准确恢复了上下文矩阵。在人类眼动跟数据中，推断的上下文矩阵特征能够捐捕预期的任务基于的人际动态差异，预测任务准确性，并与现有测量方法（CRQA和Granger因果性）显示一定的对应关系。

Conclusion: 上下文矩阵提供了一种有心理学解释意义的人际动态表征方法，为建模人际动态提供了更广阔的研究议程。

Abstract: Successful teamwork depends on interpersonal dynamics, the ways in which
individuals coordinate, influence, and adapt to one another over time. Existing
measures of interpersonal dynamics, such as CRQA, correlation, Granger
causality, and transfer entropy, typically capture only a single dimension:
either the synchrony/coordination or the direction of influence between
individuals. What is missing is a psychologically meaningful representation
that unifies these dimensions and varies systematically with behavior. We
propose the context matrix as one such representation. The context matrix is
the transition matrix in a linear dynamical system, with entries specifying how
much each individual's current behavior is attributable to their own versus
every other group member's past behaviors. Its values can be distilled into
psychologically interpretable summary features of synchrony and directional
influence. Evidence for the context matrix as psychologically meaningful is
provided in two steps. First, we develop a sequential Bayesian model that
infers context matrices from timeseries data and show that it accurately
recovers them in noisy simulations. Second, applying the model to human
eyetracking data, we show that summary features of the inferred context
matrices capture expected task-based differences in interpersonal dynamics (or
lack thereof), predict task accuracy in psychologically reasonable ways, and
show some correspondence with existing measures (CRQA and Granger causality).
We conclude by situating the context matrix within a broader agenda for
modeling interpersonal dynamics.

Motivation: 视频内容创作对表达和参与至关重要，但对感官障碍创作者（特别是在资源匮乏地区）仍然难以获得。研究旨在了解这些创作者的工具、挑战和协作实践。

Method: 对肯尼亚20位有视觉和听觉障碍的视频创作者进行访谈，分析他们的工具使用、工作流程和协作模式。

Result: 研究发现无障碍障碍和基础设施限制使视频创作成为分阶段的协作过程，涉及可信赖的人类伙伴和新兴AI工具。创作者积极协商代理权和信任，在保持创意控制的同时弥补感官差距。

Conclusion: 研究提出了对灵活、相互依赖的协作模式、包容性人机工作流程和多样化叙事实践的需求，为全球范围内更好地支持残障创作者提供了见解，扩展了HCI中无障碍研究的视野。

Abstract: Video content creation offers vital opportunities for expression and
participation, yet remains largely inaccessible to creators with sensory
impairments, especially in low-resource settings. We conducted interviews with
20 video creators with visual and hearing impairments in Kenya to examine their
tools, challenges, and collaborative practices. Our findings show that
accessibility barriers and infrastructural limitations shape video creation as
a staged, collaborative process involving trusted human partners and emerging
AI tools. Across workflows, creators actively negotiated agency and trust,
maintaining creative control while bridging sensory gaps. We discuss the need
for flexible, interdependent collaboration models, inclusive human-AI
workflows, and diverse storytelling practices. This work broadens accessibility
research in HCI by examining how technology and social factors intersect in
low-resource contexts, suggesting ways to better support disabled creators
globally.

Conclusion: 组件化是一个有前景的方向，能够将被动的文本消费转化为更主动的组件级协作，提高生产力和灵活性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce monolithic text that is hard to
edit in parts, which can slow down collaborative workflows. We present
componentization, an approach that decomposes model outputs into modular,
independently editable units while preserving context. We describe Modular and
Adaptable Output Decomposition (MAOD), which segments responses into coherent
components and maintains links among them, and we outline the Component-Based
Response Architecture (CBRA) as one way to implement this idea. Our reference
prototype, MAODchat, uses a microservices design with state-machine-based
decomposition agents, vendor-agnostic model adapters, and real-time component
manipulation with recomposition.
  In an exploratory study with four participants from academic, engineering,
and product roles, we observed that component-level editing aligned with
several common workflows and enabled iterative refinement and selective reuse.
Participants also mentioned possible team workflows. Our contributions are: (1)
a definition of componentization for transforming monolithic outputs into
manipulable units, (2) CBRA and MAODchat as a prototype architecture, (3)
preliminary observations from a small user study, (4) MAOD as an algorithmic
sketch for semantic segmentation, and (5) example Agent-to-Agent protocols for
automated decomposition. We view componentization as a promising direction for
turning passive text consumption into more active, component-level
collaboration.

Abstract: In this provocation, we suggest that much (although not all) current
uncertainty visualization simplifies the myriad forms of uncertainty into error
bars around an estimate. This apparent simplification into error bars comes
only as a result of a vast metaphysics around uncertainty and probability
underlying modern statistics. We use examples from religion to present
alternative views of uncertainty (metaphysical or otherwise) with the goal of
enriching our conception of what kind of uncertainties we ought to visualize,
and what kinds of people we might be visualizing those uncertainties for.

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative adaptive scoring framework for children
with Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDD) that is attributed to the integration
of multiple metrics, such as spatial attention patterns, temporal engagement,
and game performance data, to create a comprehensive assessment of learning
that goes beyond traditional game scoring. The framework employs a progressive
difficulty adaptation method, which focuses on specific stimuli for each level
and adjusts weights dynamically to accommodate increasing cognitive load and
learning complexity. Additionally, it includes capabilities for temporal
analysis, such as detecting engagement periods, providing rewards for sustained
attention, and implementing an adaptive multiplier framework based on
performance levels. To avoid over-rewarding high performers while maximizing
improvement potential for students who are struggling, the designed framework
features an adaptive temporal impact framework that adjusts performance scales
accordingly. We also established a multi-metric validation framework using Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Pearson correlation, and
Spearman correlation, along with defined quality thresholds for assessing
deployment readiness in educational settings. This research bridges the gap
between technical eye-tracking metrics and educational insights by explicitly
mapping attention patterns to learning behaviors, enabling actionable
pedagogical interventions.

Abstract: Eye tracking (ET) can help to understand visual attention and cognitive
processes in interactive environments. This study presents a comprehensive
eye-tracking analysis framework of the Inhibitory Control Game, named the
ReStroop game, which is an educational intervention aimed at improving
inhibitory control skills in children through a recycling-themed sorting task,
for educational assessment that processes raw gaze data through unified
algorithms for fixation detection, performance evaluation, and personalized
intervention planning. The system employs dual-threshold eye movement detection
(I-VT and advanced clustering), comprehensive Area of Interest (AOI) analysis,
and evidence-based risk assessment to transform gaze patterns into actionable
educational insights. We evaluated this framework across three difficulty
levels and revealed critical attention deficits, including low task relevance,
elevated attention scatter, and compromised processing efficiency. The
multi-dimensional risk assessment identified high to moderate risk levels,
triggering personalized interventions including focus training, attention
regulation support, and environmental modifications. The system successfully
distinguishes between adaptive learning and cognitive overload, providing early
warning indicators for educational intervention. Results demonstrate the
system's effectiveness in objective attention assessment, early risk
identification, and the generation of evidence-based recommendations for
students, teachers, and specialists, supporting data-driven educational
decision-making and personalized learning approaches.

Abstract: Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have become increasingly popular
worldwide. However, learners primarily rely on watching videos, easily losing
knowledge context and reducing learning effectiveness. We propose HyperMOOC, a
novel approach augmenting MOOC videos with concept-based embedded
visualizations to help learners maintain knowledge context. Informed by expert
interviews and literature review, HyperMOOC employs multi-glyph designs for
different knowledge types and multi-stage interactions for deeper
understanding. Using a timeline-based radial visualization, learners can grasp
cognitive paths of concepts and navigate courses through hyperlink-based
interactions. We evaluated HyperMOOC through a user study with 36 MOOC learners
and interviews with two instructors. Results demonstrate that HyperMOOC
enhances learners' learning effect and efficiency on MOOCs, with participants
showing higher satisfaction and improved course understanding compared to
traditional video-based learning approaches.

Motivation: 解决自定义符号可视化创建困难的问题，弥合设计创意与技术实现之间的鸿沟，降低设计师的技术门槛。

Method: 开发了分层容器模型的符号领域特定语言(GDSL)、原子操作管理机制，以及结合直接操作、自然语言和参数调整的多模态交互界面，使用大语言模型作为翻译器。

Result: 案例研究和13名参与者的用户访谈证实，系统显著提高了设计效率和创造性符号可视化的制作效果。

Conclusion: GlyphWeaver成功降低了设计师创建复杂符号可视化的技术门槛，为表达性可视化设计提供了实用且易用的解决方案。

Abstract: Expressive glyph visualizations provide a powerful and versatile means to
represent complex multivariate data through compact visual encodings, but
creating custom glyphs remains challenging due to the gap between design
creativity and technical implementation. We present GlyphWeaver, a novel
interactive system to enable an easy creation of expressive glyph
visualizations. Our system comprises three key components: a glyph
domain-specific language (GDSL), a GDSL operation management mechanism, and a
multimodal interaction interface. The GDSL is a hierarchical container model,
where each container is independent and composable, providing a rigorous yet
practical foundation for complex glyph visualizations. The operation management
mechanism restricts modifications of the GDSL to atomic operations, making it
accessible without requiring direct coding. The multimodal interaction
interface enables direct manipulation, natural language commands, and parameter
adjustments. A multimodal large language model acts as a translator, converting
these inputs into GDSL operations. GlyphWeaver significantly lowers the barrier
for designers, who often do not have extensive programming skills, to create
sophisticated glyph visualizations. A case study and user interviews with 13
participants confirm its substantial gains in design efficiency and
effectiveness of producing creative glyph visualizations.

*Oliver Child,Ollie Hanton,Jack Dawson,Steve Hodges,Mike Fraser*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: Printegrated Circuits是一种将传统电子元件作为3D打印材料的技术，通过在打印过程中嵌入PCB板并注入导电丝，实现自包含交互对象的3D打印，无需后处理组装步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决消费级多材料3D打印中存在的特征尺寸大、材料电阻高、可打印控制电路有限等问题，使可部署设备能够直接打印而无需后处理组装。

Method: 在打印过程中暂停，将嵌入式PCB板放入凹槽中，通过Prinjection工艺将导电丝注入PCB的镀通孔中，自动建立可靠的电气和机械连接。

Result: 开发了支持该方法的定制机器代码生成，并表征了其电气和机械性能。通过6个演示案例展示了该技术如何融入现有设计和原型制作工作流程。

Conclusion: Printegrated Circuits技术为自包含交互对象的3D打印提供了可行解决方案，消除了手动布线和定制连接器的需求，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Consumer-level multi-material 3D printing with conductive thermoplastics
enables fabrication of interactive elements for bespoke tangible devices.
However, large feature sizes, high resistance materials, and limitations of
printable control circuitry mean that deployable devices cannot be printed
without post-print assembly steps. To address these challenges, we present
Printegrated Circuits, a technique that uses traditional electronics as
material to 3D print self-contained interactive objects. Embedded PCBs are
placed into recesses during a pause in the print, and through a process we term
\textit{Prinjection}, conductive filament is injected into their plated-through
holes. This automatically creates reliable electrical and mechanical contact,
eliminating the need for manual wiring or bespoke connectors. We describe the
custom machine code generation that supports our approach, and characterise its
electrical and mechanical properties. With our 6 demonstrations, we highlight
how the Printegrated Circuits process fits into existing design and prototyping
workflows as well as informs future research agendas.

*Jacob Beck,Stephanie Eckman,Christoph Kern,Frauke Kreuter*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究发现人类与AI协作的成功不仅取决于算法性能，还取决于审查者的个人态度和工作流程设计。对AI持怀疑态度的人表现更好，而强制纠错要求反而降低参与度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人机协作在各行业决策中日益重要，需要了解心理因素如何影响协作效果，特别是认知偏见如何降低人机协作性能。

Method: 对2,784名参与者进行随机实验，控制三个因素：AI建议质量、任务负担（强制纠错要求）和绩效激励，收集人口统计、AI态度和行为数据评估四个绩效指标。

Result: 1) 强制纠错要求反而降低参与度并增加接受错误建议的倾向；2) 对AI的态度是最强预测因子，怀疑者检测错误更可靠、准确率更高，而支持者则过度依赖算法建议。

Conclusion: 成功的人机协作需要考虑人类心理学：选择多样化的评估者样本、测量态度、设计能够抵消认知偏见的工作流程。

Abstract: Human-AI collaboration increasingly drives decision-making across industries,
from medical diagnosis to content moderation. While AI systems promise
efficiency gains by providing automated suggestions for human review, these
workflows can trigger cognitive biases that degrade performance. We know little
about the psychological factors that determine when these collaborations
succeed or fail. We conducted a randomized experiment with 2,784 participants
to examine how task design and individual characteristics shape human responses
to AI-generated suggestions. Using a controlled annotation task, we manipulated
three factors: AI suggestion quality in the first three instances, task burden
through required corrections, and performance-based financial incentives. We
collected demographics, attitudes toward AI, and behavioral data to assess four
performance metrics: accuracy, correction activity, overcorrection, and
undercorrection. Two patterns emerged that challenge conventional assumptions
about human-AI collaboration. First, requiring corrections for flagged AI
errors reduced engagement and increased the tendency to accept incorrect
suggestions, demonstrating how cognitive shortcuts influence collaborative
outcomes. Second, individual attitudes toward AI emerged as the strongest
predictor of performance, surpassing demographic factors. Participants
skeptical of AI detected errors more reliably and achieved higher accuracy,
while those favorable toward automation exhibited dangerous overreliance on
algorithmic suggestions. The findings reveal that successful human-AI
collaboration depends not only on algorithmic performance but also on who
reviews AI outputs and how review processes are structured. Effective human-AI
collaborations require consideration of human psychology: selecting diverse
evaluator samples, measuring attitudes, and designing workflows that counteract
cognitive biases.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了两种先进分类和相似性学习模型在XR应用中通过运动数据识别用户的泛化能力，发现模型在同一应用内识别准确但跨应用泛化能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估XR和元宇宙应用中通过运动数据进行用户识别的泛化能力，以及这种技术在用户验证和风险评估中的适用性。

Method: 开发了包含49名用户在5种不同XR应用中运动数据的新领域数据集，包括四款游戏和一款社交应用，用于评估两种先进模型的跨应用泛化性能。

Result: 模型在同一应用内能准确识别用户，但跨不同XR应用的识别能力有限，显示出泛化能力的不足。

Conclusion: 当前模型在XR环境中的跨应用泛化能力仍有限，需要进一步研究提高运动基础用户识别的可靠性，同时也为XR和元宇宙应用的风险评估提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This paper examines the generalization capacity of two state-of-the-art
classification and similarity learning models in reliably identifying users
based on their motions in various Extended Reality (XR) applications. We
developed a novel dataset containing a wide range of motion data from 49 users
in five different XR applications: four XR games with distinct tasks and action
patterns, and an additional social XR application with no predefined task sets.
The dataset is used to evaluate the performance and, in particular, the
generalization capacity of the two models across applications. Our results
indicate that while the models can accurately identify individuals within the
same application, their ability to identify users across different XR
applications remains limited. Overall, our results provide insight into current
models generalization capabilities and suitability as biometric methods for
user verification and identification. The results also serve as a much-needed
risk assessment of hazardous and unwanted user identification in XR and
Metaverse applications. Our cross-application XR motion dataset and code are
made available to the public to encourage similar research on the
generalization of motion-based user identification in typical Metaverse
application use cases.

*Alina Tausch,Magdalena Wischnewski,Mustafa Yalciner,Daniel Neider*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 这项研究通过在线实验调查认证和验证作为AI质量保证措施对机器投资顾问信任和使用的影响，发现质量保证水平对结果变量几乎没有影响，而投资成功与否才是更重要的信任线索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI质量保证措施（如认证和验证）是否能够提升用户对机器投资顾问的信任和使用意愿，以及这些措施在实际中的效果。

Method: 采用在线情景实验设计，520名参与者被分为4组：无质量保证组、认证组、验证组和人类投资顾问对照组。测量投资金额、信任感和可靠性评价，并测试投资成功与失败的影响。

Result: 质量保证水平对大多数结果变量几乎没有影响，仅在用户对顾问的心理模型认知方面有差异。投资成功与否才是更重要的信任线索，导致信任和可靠性评分的显著差异。

Conclusion: 需要深入研究不仅是信任感，还包括实际的信任行为；形式验证虽然是数学上证明AI的黄金标准，但在用户层面并未完全发挥信任线索作用，未来需要更多研究。

Abstract: This online-vignette study investigates the impact of certification and
verification as measures for quality assurance of AI on trust and use of a
robo-advisor. Confronting 520 participants with an imaginary situation where
they were using an online banking service to invest their inherited money, we
formed 4 experimental groups. EG1 achieved no further information of their
robo-advisor, while EG2 was informed that their robo-advisor was certified by a
reliable agency for unbiased processes, and EG3 was presented with a formally
verified robo-advisor that was proven to consider their investment preferences.
A control group was presented a remote certified human financial advisor. All
groups had to decide on how much of their 10,000 euros they would give to their
advisor to autonomously invest for them and report on trust and perceived
dependability. A second manipulation happened afterwards, confronting
participants with either a successful or failed investment. Overall, our
results show that the level of quality assurance of the advisor had
surprisingly near to no effect of any of our outcome variables, except for
people's perception of their own mental model of the advisor. Descriptively,
differences between investments show that seem to favor a verified advisor with
a median investment of 65,000 euros (vs. 50,000). Success or failure
information, though influences only partially by advisor quality, has been
perceived as a more important clue for advisor trustworthiness, leading to
substantially different trust and dependability ratings. The study shows the
importance of thoroughly investigating not only trust, but also trusting
behavior with objective measures. It also underlines the need for future
research on formal verification, that might be the gold standard in proving AI
mathematically, but seems not to take full effect as a cue for trustworthiness
for end-users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字工具过于关注数量指标，忽视了兼感性交流，限制了照护者对患者个人需求的深入理解。

Method: 通过设计研究开发兼感中心可视化框架，结合人本化照护原则和兼感映射方法，并进行用户体验评估和可用性测试。

Result: 评估结果显示该框架具有可行性，参与者认为其能够支持医护人员与患者建立更个性化和兼感性的关系。

Conclusion: 该研究探索了如何系统性地将兼感嵌入可视化设计，为改善偶感性老年癖病患者在医院环境中的体验做出贡献。

Abstract: Dementia care requires healthcare professionals to balance a patient's
medical needs with a deep understanding of their personal needs, preferences,
and emotional cues. However, current digital tools prioritise quantitative
metrics over empathetic engagement,limiting caregivers ability to develop a
deeper personal understanding of their patients. This paper presents an empathy
centred visualisation framework, developed through a design study, to address
this gap. The framework integrates established principles of person centred
care with empathy mapping methodologies to encourage deeper engagement. Our
methodology provides a structured approach to designing for indirect end users,
patients whose experience is shaped by a tool they may not directly interact
with. To validate the framework, we conducted evaluations with healthcare
professinals, including usability testing of a working prototype and a User
Experience Questionnaire study. Results suggest the feasibility of the
framework, with participants highlighting its potential to support a more
personal and empathetic relationship between medical staff and patients. The
work starts to explore how empathy could be systematically embedded into
visualisation design, as we contribute to ongoing efforts in the data
visualisation community to support human centred, interpretable, and ethically
aligned clinical care, addressing the urgent need to improve dementia patients
experiences in hospital settings.

TL;DR: 研究通过对专家和澈在用户的焦点小组访谈，探索了影响个性化隐私助手（PPAs）可接受性的关键因素，包括设计元素、外部条件和系统条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个人面临的任务和决策越来越多，隐私领域的AI助手有潜力自动化执行用户的隐私偏好，但用户和专家对这种AI驱动解决方案的可接受性仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 进行五个焦点小组访谈，包括领域专家（n=11）和澈在用户（n=26），以发现形成PPAs接受度的关键主题。

Result: 影响隐私AI助手可接受性的因素包括：设计元素（如助手使用的信息来源）、外部条件（如监管和评估教育）、系统条件（如公共或市场供应商以及避免垄断的需要）。

Conclusion: 这些发现为测量PPAs的技术接受模型提供了理论扩展，对PPAs的设计和政策提供了见解，以及对AI助手设计的更广泛含义。

Abstract: Individuals increasingly face an overwhelming number of tasks and decisions.
To cope with the new reality, there is growing research interest in developing
intelligent agents that can effectively assist people across various aspects of
daily life in a tailored manner, with privacy emerging as a particular area of
application. Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants for privacy, such as
personalized privacy assistants (PPAs), have the potential to automatically
execute privacy decisions based on users' pre-defined privacy preferences,
sparing them the mental effort and time usually spent on each privacy decision.
This helps ensure that, even when users feel overwhelmed or resigned about
privacy, the decisions made by PPAs still align with their true preferences and
best interests. While research has explored possible designs of such agents,
user and expert perspectives on the acceptability of such AI-driven solutions
remain largely unexplored. In this study, we conducted five focus groups with
domain experts (n = 11) and potential users (n = 26) to uncover key themes
shaping the acceptance of PPAs. Factors influencing the acceptability of AI
assistants for privacy include design elements (such as information sources
used by the agent), external conditions (such as regulation and literacy
education), and systemic conditions (e.g., public or market providers and the
need to avoid monopoly) to PPAs. These findings provide theoretical extensions
to technology acceptance models measuring PPAs, insights on design, and policy
implications for PPAs, as well as broader implications for the design of AI
assistants.

Motivation: 细胞与环境的通信机制对细胞功能至关重要，但这些分子机制高度动态且难以实验捕捉。模拟研究为探索和预测细胞信号传导过程提供了重要手段，需要可视化工具来支持模型校准和生物学探索。

Method: 将时间序列图嵌入平行坐标中，实现模型参数和时间输出的同时分析，支持模型校准和受体运输对信号传输效率影响的探索。

Result: 开发的可视化方法能够帮助模型校准者使模拟信号响应反映参考生物学行为，并支持细胞生物学家探索受体运输对信号传输效率的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法通过集成时间序列和平行坐标的可视化技术，有效支持了细胞信号传导模拟研究的参数校准和生物学探索任务，如评估时间输出的合理性和敏感性分析。

Abstract: The ability of a cell to communicate with its environment is essential for
key cellular functions like replication, metabolism, or cell fate decisions.
The involved molecular mechanisms are highly dynamic and difficult to capture
experimentally. Simulation studies offer a valuable means for exploring and
predicting how cell signaling processes unfold. We present a design study on
the visual analysis of such studies to support 1) modelers in calibrating model
parameters such that the simulated signal responses over time reflect reference
behavior from cell biology research and 2) cell biologists in exploring the
influence of receptor trafficking on the efficiency of signal transmission
within the cell. We embed time series plots into parallel coordinates to enable
a simultaneous analysis of model parameters and temporal outputs. A usage
scenario illustrates how our approach assists with typical tasks such as
assessing the plausibility of temporal outputs or their sensitivity across
model configurations.

TL;DR: 提出一个系统，通过整合眼动追踪、激光指向数据和场景元数据来增强VR语音转录，提升指代消解准确率26.5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉浸式多模态对话中，说话者经常依赖视觉上下文和非语言线索（如手势和视觉注意力），这些信息在纯语音转录中缺失，导致指代消解任务特别困难

Method: 开发了一个系统，将VR语音转录与眼动追踪激光指向数据、场景元数据结合，生成非语言交流和感兴趣对象的文本描述。收集了12名参与者在3D公寓模型设计评审中的凝视、手势和语音数据进行评估

Result: 使用多模态转录相比纯语音基线，GPT模型的指代消解准确率提高了26.5%

Conclusion: 整合多模态信息（眼动追踪、手势和场景数据）能显著改善VR环境中指代消解的性能，证明了非语言线索对于理解沉浸式对话的重要性

Abstract: Understanding transcripts of immersive multimodal conversations is
challenging because speakers frequently rely on visual context and non-verbal
cues, such as gestures and visual attention, which are not captured in speech
alone. This lack of information makes coreferences resolution-the task of
linking ambiguous expressions like ``it'' or ``there'' to their intended
referents-particularly challenging. In this paper we present a system that
augments VR speech transcript with eye-tracking laser pointing data, and scene
metadata to generate textual descriptions of non-verbal communication and the
corresponding objects of interest. To evaluate the system, we collected gaze,
gesture, and voice data from 12 participants (6 pairs) engaged in an open-ended
design critique of a 3D model of an apartment. Our results show a 26.5\%
improvement in coreference resolution accuracy by a GPT model when using our
multimodal transcript compared to a speech-only baseline.

TL;DR: EnvX是一个利用Agentic AI将GitHub仓库转化为智能代理的框架，通过自然语言交互和代理间协作实现软件组件的自动化重用，在GitTaskBench基准测试中表现优于现有框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源软件组件的重用目前需要人工处理文档理解、API学习和集成代码编写，过程繁琐且容易出错，阻碍了高效的软件重用。

Method: EnvX采用三阶段方法：1)TODO引导的环境初始化；2)人类对齐的代理自动化；3)代理间(A2A)协作协议，结合大语言模型能力和结构化工具集成。

Result: 在GitTaskBench基准测试的18个跨领域仓库中，EnvX实现了74.07%的执行完成率和51.85%的任务通过率，优于现有框架，并能支持多仓库协作。

Conclusion: EnvX将仓库从被动代码资源转变为智能交互代理，为开源生态系统提供了更大的可访问性和协作能力，代表了软件重用方式的重大转变。

Abstract: The widespread availability of open-source repositories has led to a vast
collection of reusable software components, yet their utilization remains
manual, error-prone, and disconnected. Developers must navigate documentation,
understand APIs, and write integration code, creating significant barriers to
efficient software reuse. To address this, we present EnvX, a framework that
leverages Agentic AI to agentize GitHub repositories, transforming them into
intelligent, autonomous agents capable of natural language interaction and
inter-agent collaboration. Unlike existing approaches that treat repositories
as static code resources, EnvX reimagines them as active agents through a
three-phase process: (1) TODO-guided environment initialization, which sets up
the necessary dependencies, data, and validation datasets; (2) human-aligned
agentic automation, allowing repository-specific agents to autonomously perform
real-world tasks; and (3) Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol, enabling multiple
agents to collaborate. By combining large language model capabilities with
structured tool integration, EnvX automates not just code generation, but the
entire process of understanding, initializing, and operationalizing repository
functionality. We evaluate EnvX on the GitTaskBench benchmark, using 18
repositories across domains such as image processing, speech recognition,
document analysis, and video manipulation. Our results show that EnvX achieves
a 74.07% execution completion rate and 51.85% task pass rate, outperforming
existing frameworks. Case studies further demonstrate EnvX's ability to enable
multi-repository collaboration via the A2A protocol. This work marks a shift
from treating repositories as passive code resources to intelligent,
interactive agents, fostering greater accessibility and collaboration within
the open-source ecosystem.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了两种基于学习的动态目标指向方法（强化学习和模仿学习），用于改善地球观测卫星的数据采集效率，超越传统惯例方法约10-14%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测卫星存在轨道偏移困难、传感器视野有限、指向操作耗资源等限制，需要优化数据采集效率。动态目标指向技术可以利用卫星资源和预览仪器数据进行智能重配置。

Method: 提出两种学习方法：强化学习和模仿学习。这些方法基于动态规划解决方案来规划采样位置序列。

Result: 模仿学习比最佳惯例方法平均提高10.0%，强化学习平均提高13.7%。两种学习方法都能在较少数据量下有效训练。

Conclusion: 学习方法在动态目标指向应用中显示出显著优势，能够提高科学数据采集的数量和质量。

Abstract: Earth observing satellites are powerful tools for collecting scientific
information about our planet, however they have limitations: they cannot easily
deviate from their orbital trajectories, their sensors have a limited field of
view, and pointing and operating these sensors can take a large amount of the
spacecraft's resources. It is important for these satellites to optimize the
data they collect and include only the most important or informative
measurements. Dynamic targeting is an emerging concept in which satellite
resources and data from a lookahead instrument are used to intelligently
reconfigure and point a primary instrument. Simulation studies have shown that
dynamic targeting increases the amount of scientific information gathered
versus conventional sampling strategies. In this work, we present two different
learning-based approaches to dynamic targeting, using reinforcement and
imitation learning, respectively. These learning methods build on a dynamic
programming solution to plan a sequence of sampling locations. We evaluate our
approaches against existing heuristic methods for dynamic targeting, showing
the benefits of using learning for this application. Imitation learning
performs on average 10.0\% better than the best heuristic method, while
reinforcement learning performs on average 13.7\% better. We also show that
both learning methods can be trained effectively with relatively small amounts
of data.

Motivation: 尽管AI系统现在既能做决策又能进行故事推理，但这两种能力主要是分开研究的，需要建立平台来探索它们之间的交互作用

Method: 采用双系统架构：一个基于过往经验建议行动的强化学习策略，和一个通过不同故事框架处理这些建议来指导决策的语言模型，在可配置的gridworld环境中实现

Result: 开发了一个模块化的实验平台，能够进行环境复杂性、故事参数以及强化学习与故事基决策之间交互作用的受控测试，并记录了基本的决策指标

Conclusion: 这个初步实现为研究不同故事框架如何影响奖励基决策提供了基础，也为探索优化基学习与符号推理在AI系统中的潜在交互作用开启了新方向

Abstract: We present a preliminary experimental platform that explores how narrative
elements might shape AI decision-making by combining reinforcement learning
(RL) with language model reasoning. While AI systems can now both make
decisions and engage in narrative reasoning, these capabilities have mostly
been studied separately. Our platform attempts to bridge this gap using a
dual-system architecture to examine how narrative frameworks could influence
reward-based learning. The system comprises a reinforcement learning policy
that suggests actions based on past experience, and a language model that
processes these suggestions through different narrative frameworks to guide
decisions. This setup enables initial experimentation with narrative elements
while maintaining consistent environment and reward structures. We implement
this architecture in a configurable gridworld environment, where agents receive
both policy suggestions and information about their surroundings. The
platform's modular design facilitates controlled testing of environmental
complexity, narrative parameters, and the interaction between reinforcement
learning and narrative-based decisions. Our logging system captures basic
decision metrics, from RL policy values to language model reasoning to action
selection patterns. While preliminary, this implementation provides a
foundation for studying how different narrative frameworks might affect
reward-based decisions and exploring potential interactions between
optimization-based learning and symbolic reasoning in AI systems.

Method: 提出2TSD模型，采用LAM驱动的教师-学生机器人架构。教师机器人部署在服务器上，负责多维信任数据收集、任务特定信任语义提取和任务-协作者匹配分析，然后向学生机器人传递信任语义

Result: 实验结果表明2TSD模型能够减少协作者评估时间、降低设备资源消耗并提高协作者选择的准确性

Conclusion: 该模型通过中央化的信任语义提取和分布式传递，有效解决了分布式信任评估中的性能问题，为复杂计算任务的协作选择提供了高效准确的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate trustworthiness evaluation of potential collaborating devices is
essential for the effective execution of complex computing tasks. This
evaluation process involves collecting diverse trust-related data from
potential collaborators, including historical performance and available
resources, for collaborator selection. However, when each task owner
independently assesses all collaborators' trustworthiness, frequent data
exchange, complex reasoning, and dynamic situation changes can result in
significant overhead and deteriorated trust evaluation. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a task-specific trust semantics distillation (2TSD)
model based on a large AI model (LAM)-driven teacher-student agent
architecture. The teacher agent is deployed on a server with powerful
computational capabilities and an augmented memory module dedicated to
multidimensional trust-related data collection, task-specific trust semantics
extraction, and task-collaborator matching analysis. Upon receiving
task-specific requests from device-side student agents, the teacher agent
transfers the trust semantics of potential collaborators to the student agents,
enabling rapid and accurate collaborator selection. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed 2TSD model can reduce collaborator evaluation
time, decrease device resource consumption, and improve the accuracy of
collaborator selection.

Conclusion: ExRAP框架有效提升了具身智能体在动态环境中的任务执行成功率和效率，具有良好的鲁棒性和实用性

Abstract: This study presents an Exploratory Retrieval-Augmented Planning (ExRAP)
framework, designed to tackle continual instruction following tasks of embodied
agents in dynamic, non-stationary environments. The framework enhances Large
Language Models' (LLMs) embodied reasoning capabilities by efficiently
exploring the physical environment and establishing the environmental context
memory, thereby effectively grounding the task planning process in time-varying
environment contexts. In ExRAP, given multiple continual instruction following
tasks, each instruction is decomposed into queries on the environmental context
memory and task executions conditioned on the query results. To efficiently
handle these multiple tasks that are performed continuously and simultaneously,
we implement an exploration-integrated task planning scheme by incorporating
the {information-based exploration} into the LLM-based planning process.
Combined with memory-augmented query evaluation, this integrated scheme not
only allows for a better balance between the validity of the environmental
context memory and the load of environment exploration, but also improves
overall task performance. Furthermore, we devise a {temporal consistency

Abstract: As a result of continuous advances in Music Information Retrieval (MIR)
technology, generating and distributing music has become more diverse and
accessible. In this context, interest in music intellectual property protection
is increasing to safeguard individual music copyrights. In this work, we
propose a system for detecting music plagiarism by combining various MIR
technologies. We developed a music segment transcription system that extracts
musically meaningful segments from audio recordings to detect plagiarism across
different musical formats. With this system, we compute similarity scores based
on multiple musical features that can be evaluated through comprehensive
musical analysis. Our approach demonstrated promising results in music
plagiarism detection experiments, and the proposed method can be applied to
real-world music scenarios. We also collected a Similar Music Pair (SMP)
dataset for musical similarity research using real-world cases. The dataset are
publicly available.

Abstract: The evolution toward Level 4 (L4) Autonomous Networks (AN) represents a
strategic inflection point in telecommunications, where networks must transcend
reactive automation to achieve genuine cognitive capabilities--fulfilling TM
Forum's vision of self-configuring, self-healing, and self-optimizing systems
that deliver zero-wait, zero-touch, and zero-fault services. This work bridges
the gap between architectural theory and operational reality by implementing
Joseph Sifakis's AN Agent reference architecture in a functional cognitive
system, deploying coordinated proactive-reactive runtimes driven by hybrid
knowledge representation. Through an empirical case study of a Radio Access
Network (RAN) Link Adaptation (LA) Agent, we validate this framework's
transformative potential: demonstrating sub-10 ms real-time control in 5G NR
sub-6 GHz while achieving 6% higher downlink throughput than Outer Loop Link
Adaptation (OLLA) algorithms and 67% Block Error Rate (BLER) reduction for
ultra-reliable services through dynamic Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS)
optimization. These improvements confirm the architecture's viability in
overcoming traditional autonomy barriers and advancing critical L4-enabling
capabilities toward next-generation objectives.

Abstract: Generating regulatorily compliant Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) remains a
high-cost, low-scalability bottleneck in Anti-Money Laundering (AML) workflows.
While large language models (LLMs) offer promising fluency, they suffer from
factual hallucination, limited crime typology alignment, and poor
explainability -- posing unacceptable risks in compliance-critical domains.
This paper introduces Co-Investigator AI, an agentic framework optimized to
produce Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) significantly faster and with
greater accuracy than traditional methods. Drawing inspiration from recent
advances in autonomous agent architectures, such as the AI Co-Scientist, our
approach integrates specialized agents for planning, crime type detection,
external intelligence gathering, and compliance validation. The system features
dynamic memory management, an AI-Privacy Guard layer for sensitive data
handling, and a real-time validation agent employing the Agent-as-a-Judge
paradigm to ensure continuous narrative quality assurance. Human investigators
remain firmly in the loop, empowered to review and refine drafts in a
collaborative workflow that blends AI efficiency with domain expertise. We
demonstrate the versatility of Co-Investigator AI across a range of complex
financial crime scenarios, highlighting its ability to streamline SAR drafting,
align narratives with regulatory expectations, and enable compliance teams to
focus on higher-order analytical work. This approach marks the beginning of a
new era in compliance reporting -- bringing the transformative benefits of AI
agents to the core of regulatory processes and paving the way for scalable,
reliable, and transparent SAR generation.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习和思维链的后SFT方法存在稀疏奖励、动作优化限制、样本效率低、一致性差和模型退化等问题，需要更有效的具身决策对齐方法。

Method: 提出TCPO方法：1) 逐步偏好优化，将稀疏奖励信号转化为更丰富的步骤样本对；2) 强调中间推理过程对齐；3) 引入动作策略一致性约束(APC)对模型输出施加一致性约束。

Result: 在ALFWorld环境中平均成功率达到26.67%，相比RL4VLM提升6%，有效缓解了微调后的模型退化问题。

Conclusion: 将基于偏好的学习技术与思维链过程结合，能够有效提升视觉语言模型在具身智能体中的决策能力，TCPO方法为解决模型退化问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Using effective generalization capabilities of vision language models (VLMs)
in context-specific dynamic tasks for embodied artificial intelligence remains
a significant challenge. Although supervised fine-tuned models can better align
with the real physical world, they still exhibit sluggish responses and
hallucination issues in dynamically changing environments, necessitating
further alignment. Existing post-SFT methods, reliant on reinforcement learning
and chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches, are constrained by sparse rewards and
action-only optimization, resulting in low sample efficiency, poor consistency,
and model degradation. To address these issues, this paper proposes
Thought-Centric Preference Optimization (TCPO) for effective embodied
decision-making. Specifically, TCPO introduces a stepwise preference-based
optimization approach, transforming sparse reward signals into richer step
sample pairs. It emphasizes the alignment of the model's intermediate reasoning
process, mitigating the problem of model degradation. Moreover, by
incorporating Action Policy Consistency Constraint (APC), it further imposes
consistency constraints on the model output. Experiments in the ALFWorld
environment demonstrate an average success rate of 26.67%, achieving a 6%
improvement over RL4VLM and validating the effectiveness of our approach in
mitigating model degradation after fine-tuning. These results highlight the
potential of integrating preference-based learning techniques with CoT
processes to enhance the decision-making capabilities of vision-language models
in embodied agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当使用LLM作为评委评估其他LLM的复杂决策时，由于缺乏真实标签且不想完全信任评委，需要建立有效的监控机制来确保评估质量。

Method: 利用评委之间的逻辑一致性，通过观察LLM评委在评分时的同意和分歧情况，将其形式化为线性规划问题，计算评委的评分能力。

Result: 开发了无知识警报系统，能够在没有真实标签的情况下，无假阳性地检测出评委集合中至少一个成员违反了用户指定的评分能力要求。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的机制来监控LLM评委的质量，通过逻辑一致性分析可以在缺乏真实标签的情况下可靠地识别有问题的评委。

Abstract: If we use LLMs as judges to evaluate the complex decisions of other LLMs, who
or what monitors the judges? Infinite monitoring chains are inevitable whenever
we do not know the ground truth of the decisions by experts and we do not want
to trust them. One way to ameliorate our evaluation uncertainty is to exploit
the use of logical consistency between disagreeing experts. By observing how
LLM judges agree and disagree while grading other LLMs, we can compute the only
possible evaluations of their grading ability. For example, if two LLM judges
disagree on which tasks a third one completed correctly, they cannot both be
100\% correct in their judgments. This logic can be formalized as a Linear
Programming problem in the space of integer response counts for any finite
test. We use it here to develop no-knowledge alarms for misaligned LLM judges.
The alarms can detect, with no false positives, that at least one member or
more of an ensemble of judges are violating a user specified grading ability
requirement.

Conclusion: 该工作为调试复杂智能体交互提供了原则性和有效的解决方案，为更可靠和可解释的多智能体系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.

Result: 在标准错误信念任务上验证了模型的有效性，成功模仿了人类的适应性行为和认知偏见（如错前效应、认知负荷疲劳、框架效应、启发效应），并实现了对未见上下文的健壮推广。

Conclusion: 这项工作在人工智能和认知理论之间建立了桥梁，为开发具有细致、类人社交认知和适应性决策能力的AI系统排除了道路。

Abstract: We introduce a novel Theory of Mind (ToM) framework inspired by dual-process
theories from cognitive science, integrating a fast, habitual graph-based
reasoning system (System 1), implemented via graph convolutional networks
(GCNs), and a slower, context-sensitive meta-adaptive learning system (System
2), driven by meta-learning techniques. Our model dynamically balances
intuitive and deliberative reasoning through a learned context gate mechanism.
We validate our architecture on canonical false-belief tasks and systematically
explore its capacity to replicate hallmark cognitive biases associated with
dual-process theory, including anchoring, cognitive-load fatigue, framing
effects, and priming effects. Experimental results demonstrate that our
dual-process approach closely mirrors human adaptive behavior, achieves robust
generalization to unseen contexts, and elucidates cognitive mechanisms
underlying reasoning biases. This work bridges artificial intelligence and
cognitive theory, paving the way for AI systems exhibiting nuanced, human-like
social cognition and adaptive decision-making capabilities.

Conclusion: 建议期刊和会议在评估AI生成研究时要求提交完整工作流日志和代码，以确保透明度、问责制和可重复性

Abstract: AI scientist systems, capable of autonomously executing the full research
workflow from hypothesis generation and experimentation to paper writing, hold
significant potential for accelerating scientific discovery. However, the
internal workflow of these systems have not been closely examined. This lack of
scrutiny poses a risk of introducing flaws that could undermine the integrity,
reliability, and trustworthiness of their research outputs. In this paper, we
identify four potential failure modes in contemporary AI scientist systems:
inappropriate benchmark selection, data leakage, metric misuse, and post-hoc
selection bias. To examine these risks, we design controlled experiments that
isolate each failure mode while addressing challenges unique to evaluating AI
scientist systems. Our assessment of two prominent open-source AI scientist
systems reveals the presence of several failures, across a spectrum of
severity, which can be easily overlooked in practice. Finally, we demonstrate
that access to trace logs and code from the full automated workflow enables far
more effective detection of such failures than examining the final paper alone.
We thus recommend journals and conferences evaluating AI-generated research to
mandate submission of these artifacts alongside the paper to ensure
transparency, accountability, and reproducibility.

Abstract: Generating 3D shapes at part level is pivotal for downstream applications
such as mesh retopology, UV mapping, and 3D printing. However, existing

X-Part, a controllable generative model designed to decompose a holistic 3D

geometric fidelity. X-Part exploits the bounding box as prompts for the part
generation and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful
decomposition. Furthermore, we design an editable pipeline for interactive part
generation. Extensive experimental results show that X-Part achieves
state-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation. This work

Motivation: 当前大音频语言模型评估存在三大问题：处理速度慢限制大规模研究、提示不一致影响可复现性、任务覆盖窄忽略重要音频推理能力，需要开发更高效的评估框架。

Method: 开发LALM-Eval框架，通过优化的批处理和并行执行实现速度提升，提供标准化提示协议和灵活配置，并引入LLM-Adaptive Diarization和Spoken Language Reasoning两个新评估类别。

Result: 在380+个任务上评估显示，速度提升达127%，发现当前LALMs在时间理解和复杂语音推理任务存在显著差距，指令模态标准化缺失导致性能差异达9.5个百分点。

Conclusion: LALM-Eval提供了实用的评估工具和模型局限性的深入见解，推动了大音频语言模型的系统性发展，解决了现有评估框架的关键瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are rapidly advancing, but evaluating
them remains challenging due to inefficient toolkits that limit fair comparison
and systematic assessment. Current frameworks suffer from three critical
issues: slow processing that bottlenecks large-scale studies, inconsistent
prompting that hurts reproducibility, and narrow task coverage that misses
important audio reasoning capabilities. We introduce LALM-Eval, an efficient
and comprehensive evaluation framework for LALMs. Our system achieves a speedup
of up to 127% over existing toolkits through optimized batch processing and
parallel execution, enabling large-scale evaluations previously impractical. We
provide standardized prompting protocols and flexible configurations for fair
model comparison across diverse scenarios. Additionally, we introduce two new
evaluation categories: LLM-Adaptive Diarization for temporal audio
understanding and Spoken Language Reasoning for complex audio-based cognitive
tasks. Through evaluation across 380+ tasks, we reveal significant gaps in
current LALMs, particularly in temporal understanding and complex spoken
language reasoning tasks. Our findings also highlight a lack of standardization
in instruction modality existent across audio benchmarks, which can lead up
performance differences up to 9.5 absolute points on the challenging complex
instruction following downstream tasks. LALM-Eval provides both practical
evaluation tools and insights into model limitations, advancing systematic LALM
development.

Conclusion: 将片段级音乐特征整合到长时程时间分析中，能有效提升AIGM检测系统的性能和鲁棒性

Abstract: Audio and music generation systems have been remarkably developed in the
music information retrieval (MIR) research field. The advancement of these
technologies raises copyright concerns, as ownership and authorship of
AI-generated music (AIGM) remain unclear. Also, it can be difficult to
determine whether a piece was generated by AI or composed by humans clearly. To
address these challenges, we aim to improve the accuracy of AIGM detection by
analyzing the structural patterns of music segments. Specifically, to extract
musical features from short audio clips, we integrated various pre-trained
models, including self-supervised learning (SSL) models or an audio effect
encoder, each within our suggested transformer-based framework. Furthermore,
for long audio, we developed a segment transformer that divides music into
segments and learns inter-segment relationships. We used the FakeMusicCaps and
SONICS datasets, achieving high accuracy in both the short-audio and full-audio
detection experiments. These findings suggest that integrating segment-level
musical features into long-range temporal analysis can effectively enhance both
the performance and robustness of AIGM detection systems.

Method: 1）在自动编码器瓶颈层中引入潜在滿散模型进行反向滿散 2）使用流匹配模型作为滿散模型的替代方案以加速转换

Result: 实验结果显示改进版在语音质量和转换速度方面都比原版更优

Conclusion: 通过潜在滿散和流匹配技术，成功提升了VoiceGrad的性能，在保持转换质量的同时大幅加速转换过程

Abstract: Previously, we introduced VoiceGrad, a nonparallel voice conversion (VC)
technique enabling mel-spectrogram conversion from source to target speakers
using a score-based diffusion model. The concept involves training a score
network to predict the gradient of the log density of mel-spectrograms from
various speakers. VC is executed by iteratively adjusting an input
mel-spectrogram until resembling the target speaker's. However, challenges
persist: audio quality needs improvement, and conversion is slower compared to
modern VC methods designed to operate at very high speeds. To address these, we
introduce latent diffusion models into VoiceGrad, proposing an improved version
with reverse diffusion in the autoencoder bottleneck. Additionally, we propose
using a flow matching model as an alternative to the diffusion model to further
speed up the conversion process without compromising the conversion quality.
Experimental results show enhanced speech quality and accelerated conversion
compared to the original.

Motivation: 大型预训练语音模型如Whisper具有强大泛化能力，但其资源高效的适配方法（特别是LoRA）在语音任务中的工作机制尚不明确，需要进行系统性研究

Method: 使用层贡献探测、logit-lens检查、SVD和CKA表示相似性分析等工具，对Whisper编码器中的LoRA在语音情感识别任务中进行机制可解释性研究

Result: 发现了两个关键机制：1）延迟专业化过程（早期层保留通用特征，后期层整合任务特定信息）；2）LoRA矩阵间的前向对齐-后向分化动态

Conclusion: 阐明了LoRA如何重塑编码器层次结构，为设计高效且可解释的大型语音模型适配策略提供了实证见解和机制理解

Abstract: Large pre-trained speech models such as Whisper offer strong generalization
but pose significant challenges for resource-efficient adaptation. Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has become a popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning method,
yet its underlying mechanisms in speech tasks remain poorly understood. In this
work, we conduct the first systematic mechanistic interpretability study of
LoRA within the Whisper encoder for speech emotion recognition (SER). Using a
suite of analytical tools, including layer contribution probing, logit-lens
inspection, and representational similarity via singular value decomposition
(SVD) and centered kernel alignment (CKA), we reveal two key mechanisms: a
delayed specialization process that preserves general features in early layers
before consolidating task-specific information, and a forward alignment,
backward differentiation dynamic between LoRA's matrices. Our findings clarify
how LoRA reshapes encoder hierarchies, providing both empirical insights and a
deeper mechanistic understanding for designing efficient and interpretable
adaptation strategies in large speech models.

Method: 将音频转换为频谱图，训练CNN分类模型（准确率94.8%），应用模型无关方法（LIME、SHAP）和模型特定方法（DeepLIFT、Grad-CAM）进行解释

Result: 不同XAI技术产生互补的解释，结合使用时能提供更完整、可解释的模型决策洞察

Conclusion: 使用多种XAI技术组合能提高模型信任度和互操作性，不仅在声学信号分析中，在其他领域特定任务中也有广泛适用性

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has emerged as a critical tool for
interpreting the predictions of complex deep learning models. While XAI has
been increasingly applied in various domains within acoustics, its use in
bioacoustics, which involves analyzing audio signals from living organisms,
remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the
vocalizations of a bird species with strong geographic variation throughout its
range in North America. Audio recordings were converted into spectrogram images
and used to train a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classification,
achieving an accuracy of 94.8\%. To interpret the model's predictions, we
applied both model-agnostic (LIME, SHAP) and model-specific (DeepLIFT,
Grad-CAM) XAI techniques. These techniques produced different but complementary
explanations, and when their explanations were considered together, they
provided more complete and interpretable insights into the model's
decision-making. This work highlights the importance of using a combination of
XAI techniques to improve trust and interoperability, not only in broader
acoustics signal analysis but also argues for broader applicability in
different domain specific tasks.

Abstract: The multimodal nature of music performance has driven increasing interest in
data beyond the audio domain within the music information retrieval (MIR)
community. This paper introduces PianoVAM, a comprehensive piano performance
dataset that includes videos, audio, MIDI, hand landmarks, fingering labels,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造生成技术快速发展，传统检测方法需要频繁且昂贵的重新训练，无法有效应对不断演变的伪造技术。

Method: 提出持续学习框架，模拟真实世界深度伪造技术的时序演变过程，基于轻量级视觉骨干网络实现实时检测性能，并引入两个新评估指标C-AUC和FWT-AUC。

Result: 实现了高效适应（比完全重新训练快155倍）和稳健的历史知识保留，但对未来生成器的泛化能力接近随机水平（FWT-AUC≈0.5）。

Conclusion: 提出了非通用深度伪造分布假设，指出当前方法对未来生成器的泛化存在根本性挑战，需要新的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation technologies poses critical
challenges for detection systems, as non-continual learning methods demand
frequent and expensive retraining. We reframe deepfake detection (DFD) as a
Continual Learning (CL) problem, proposing an efficient framework that
incrementally adapts to emerging visual manipulation techniques while retaining
knowledge of past generators. Our framework, unlike prior approaches that rely
on unreal simulation sequences, simulates the real-world chronological
evolution of deepfake technologies in extended periods across 7 years.
Simultaneously, our framework builds upon lightweight visual backbones to allow
for the real-time performance of DFD systems. Additionally, we contribute two
novel metrics: Continual AUC (C-AUC) for historical performance and Forward
Transfer AUC (FWT-AUC) for future generalization. Through extensive
experimentation (over 600 simulations), we empirically demonstrate that while
efficient adaptation (+155 times faster than full retraining) and robust
retention of historical knowledge is possible, the generalization of current
approaches to future generators without additional training remains near-random
(FWT-AUC $\approx$ 0.5) due to the unique imprint characterizing each existing
generator. Such observations are the foundation of our newly proposed
Non-Universal Deepfake Distribution Hypothesis.
  \textbf{Code will be released upon acceptance.}

TL;DR: SAPO是一种完全去中心化的异步RL后训练算法，专为异构计算节点网络设计，解决了传统RL训练中的并行化瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL后训练需要大规模并行化推理，带来延迟、内存、可靠性等技术挑战和高昂成本，需要一种去中心化的解决方案。

Method: SAPO采用完全去中心化和异步架构，各节点管理自己的策略模型并在网络中"共享"rollouts，无需假设延迟、模型同质性或硬件要求。

Result: 在受控实验中SAPO实现了高达94%的累积奖励增益，并在数千个节点的开源演示中成功测试。

Conclusion: SAPO有效解决了RL后训练的扩展瓶颈，支持异构硬件和模型，促进了"顿悟时刻"的传播和学习过程的引导。

Abstract: Post-training language models (LMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) can
enhance their complex reasoning capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as
demonstrated by DeepSeek-R1-Zero. However, effectively utilizing RL for LMs
requires significant parallelization to scale-up inference, which introduces
non-trivial technical challenges (e.g. latency, memory, and reliability)
alongside ever-growing financial costs. We present Swarm sAmpling Policy
Optimization (SAPO), a fully decentralized and asynchronous RL post-training
algorithm. SAPO is designed for decentralized networks of heterogenous compute
nodes, where each node manages its own policy model(s) while "sharing" rollouts
with others in the network; no explicit assumptions about latency, model
homogeneity, or hardware are required and nodes can operate in silo if desired.
As a result, the algorithm avoids common bottlenecks in scaling RL
post-training while also allowing (and even encouraging) new possibilities. By
sampling rollouts "shared" across the network, it enables "Aha moments" to
propagate, thereby bootstrapping the learning process. In this paper we show
SAPO achieved cumulative reward gains of up to 94% in controlled experiments.
We also share insights from tests on a network with thousands of nodes
contributed by Gensyn community members running the algorithm on diverse
hardware and models during an open-source demo.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现现有不可学习样本方法在多任务场景下失效，通过损失景观分析提出了基于参数锐度感知可学习性(SAL)的不可学习距离(UD)来衡量数据不可学习性，揭示了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不可学习样本方法在未知训练目的和强大模型表示学习能力下，期望实现跨任务不可学习性，但研究发现这些方法在多任务数据集上仍然有效，无法真正实现不可学习性。

Method: 通过观察干净模型和中毒模型的收敛过程差异，从损失景观角度分析关键参数优化路径，提出SAL量化参数不可学习性，并基于此提出UD指标来衡量数据的不可学习性。

Result: 在Taskonomy多任务数据集上测试发现现有不可学习方法在语义分割等任务中仍然有效，无法实现跨任务不可学习性。提出的UD指标能够有效评估现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 现有不可学习方法距离实现真正的不可学习性还有差距，需要从损失景观和参数优化角度重新思考不可学习性的本质，提出的SAL和UD为评估和改进不可学习方法提供了新视角。

Abstract: High-quality data plays an indispensable role in the era of large models, but
the use of unauthorized data for model training greatly damages the interests
of data owners. To overcome this threat, several unlearnable methods have been
proposed, which generate unlearnable examples (UEs) by compromising the
training availability of data. Clearly, due to unknown training purposes and
the powerful representation learning capabilities of existing models, these
data are expected to be unlearnable for models across multiple tasks, i.e.,
they will not help improve the model's performance. However, unexpectedly, we
find that on the multi-task dataset Taskonomy, UEs still perform well in tasks
such as semantic segmentation, failing to exhibit cross-task unlearnability.
This phenomenon leads us to question: How far are we from attaining truly
unlearnable examples? We attempt to answer this question from the perspective
of model optimization. To this end, we observe the difference in the
convergence process between clean and poisoned models using a simple model
architecture. Subsequently, from the loss landscape we find that only a part of
the critical parameter optimization paths show significant differences,
implying a close relationship between the loss landscape and unlearnability.
Consequently, we employ the loss landscape to explain the underlying reasons
for UEs and propose Sharpness-Aware Learnability (SAL) to quantify the
unlearnability of parameters based on this explanation. Furthermore, we propose
an Unlearnable Distance (UD) to measure the unlearnability of data based on the
SAL distribution of parameters in clean and poisoned models. Finally, we
conduct benchmark tests on mainstream unlearnable methods using the proposed
UD, aiming to promote community awareness of the capability boundaries of
existing unlearnable methods.

Abstract: We present JEL, a novel computationally efficient end-to-end multi-neural
network based entity linking model, which beats current state-of-art model.
Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing
critical relationships among the entities of interest and integrating data from
multiple heterogeneous sources. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph
is linking its entities to the mentions (e.g., people, company names) that are
encountered in textual sources (e.g., news, blogs., etc) correctly, since there
are thousands of entities to consider for each mention. This task of linking
mentions and entities is referred as Entity Linking (EL). It is a fundamental
task in natural language processing and is beneficial in various uses cases,
such as building a New Analytics platform. News Analytics, in JPMorgan, is an
essential task that benefits multiple groups across the firm. According to a
survey conducted by the Innovation Digital team 1 , around 25 teams across the
firm are actively looking for news analytics solutions, and more than \$2
million is being spent annually on external vendor costs. Entity linking is
critical for bridging unstructured news text with knowledge graphs, enabling
users access to vast amounts of curated data in a knowledge graph and

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) represent an emerging paradigm
within artificial intelligence, with applications throughout the medical
enterprise. Assessing GenAI applications necessitates a comprehensive
understanding of the clinical task and awareness of the variability in
performance when implemented in actual clinical environments. Presently, a
prevalent method for evaluating the performance of generative models relies on
quantitative benchmarks. Such benchmarks have limitations and may suffer from
train-to-the-test overfitting, optimizing performance for a specified test set
at the cost of generalizability across other task and data distributions.
Evaluation strategies leveraging human expertise and utilizing cost-effective
computational models as evaluators are gaining interest. We discuss current
state-of-the-art methodologies for assessing the performance of GenAI
applications in healthcare and medical devices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的联邦学习后门攻击防御方法Hammer and Anvil，通过结合两种正交防御机制来对抗自适应攻击者，其中Krum+防御方案能够有效抵御新型自适应攻击和现有最先进攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习分布式特性使其容易受到恶意客户端的后门攻击，现有防御方法在面对自适应攻击者时表现不佳，特别是缺乏对强大但未充分探索的自适应攻击类别的有效防御。

Method: 首先设计了一种超越现有攻击者能力的新型自适应对手，然后提出了Hammer and Anvil防御框架，该框架结合了两种底层原理正交的防御方法，通过参数优化产生能够抵御任何攻击的组合防御。

Result: 新型自适应攻击仅需20个客户端中的1-2个恶意客户端就能突破现有最先进防御；而提出的Krum+组合防御方案成功抵御了新型自适应攻击和现有最先进攻击。

Conclusion: Hammer and Anvil提供了一种原则性的防御方法，通过正交防御机制的组合能够有效对抗联邦学习中的后门攻击，特别是针对强大的自适应攻击者。

Abstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning technique in which multiple
clients cooperate to train a machine learning model. Distributed settings
facilitate backdoor attacks by malicious clients, who can embed malicious
behaviors into the model during their participation in the training process.
These malicious behaviors are activated during inference by a specific trigger.
No defense against backdoor attacks has stood the test of time, especially
against adaptive attackers, a powerful but not fully explored category of
attackers. In this work, we first devise a new adaptive adversary that
surpasses existing adversaries in capabilities, yielding attacks that only
require one or two malicious clients out of 20 to break existing
state-of-the-art defenses. Then, we present Hammer and Anvil, a principled
defense approach that combines two defenses orthogonal in their underlying
principle to produce a combined defense that, given the right set of
parameters, must succeed against any attack. We show that our best combined
defense, Krum+, is successful against our new adaptive adversary and
state-of-the-art attacks.

Motivation: AI心电图分析受限于标注数据稀缺，自监督学习可以利用大规模未标注数据，但现有方法缺乏对ECG生理特性的考虑。

Method: 提出PhysioCLR框架：1）在预训练中学习临床相关特征的相似样本嵌入；2）整合ECG生理相似性线索；3）引入ECG特异性增强技术；4）使用混合损失函数优化表示质量。

Result: 在Chapman、Georgia和私有ICU数据集上，PhysioCLR相比最强基线平均AUROC提升12%，展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过将生理知识嵌入对比学习，PhysioCLR能够学习具有临床意义且可迁移的ECG特征，为更有效和标签高效的心电图诊断提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Objective: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) play a crucial role in diagnosing heart
conditions; however, the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-based
ECG analysis is often hindered by the limited availability of labeled data.
Self-supervised learning (SSL) can address this by leveraging large-scale
unlabeled data. We introduce PhysioCLR (Physiology-aware Contrastive Learning
Representation for ECG), a physiology-aware contrastive learning framework that
incorporates domain-specific priors to enhance the generalizability and
clinical relevance of ECG-based arrhythmia classification. Methods: During
pretraining, PhysioCLR learns to bring together embeddings of samples that
share similar clinically relevant features while pushing apart those that are
dissimilar. Unlike existing methods, our method integrates ECG physiological
similarity cues into contrastive learning, promoting the learning of clinically
meaningful representations. Additionally, we introduce ECG- specific
augmentations that preserve the ECG category post augmentation and propose a
hybrid loss function to further refine the quality of learned representations.
Results: We evaluate PhysioCLR on two public ECG datasets, Chapman and Georgia,
for multilabel ECG diagnoses, as well as a private ICU dataset labeled for
binary classification. Across the Chapman, Georgia, and private cohorts,
PhysioCLR boosts the mean AUROC by 12% relative to the strongest baseline,
underscoring its robust cross-dataset generalization. Conclusion: By embedding
physiological knowledge into contrastive learning, PhysioCLR enables the model
to learn clinically meaningful and transferable ECG eatures. Significance:
PhysioCLR demonstrates the potential of physiology-informed SSL to offer a
promising path toward more effective and label-efficient ECG diagnostics.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a novel, multidisciplinary Machine Learning
paradigm where multiple clients, such as mobile devices, collaborate to solve
machine learning problems. Initially introduced in Kone{\v{c}}n{\'y} et al.
(2016a,b); McMahan et al. (2017), FL has gained further attention through its
inclusion in the National AI Research and Development Strategic Plan (2023
Update) of the United States (Science and on Artificial Intelligence, 2023).
The FL training process is inherently decentralized and often takes place in
less controlled settings compared to data centers, posing unique challenges
distinct from those in fully controlled environments. In this thesis, we
identify five key challenges in Federated Learning and propose novel approaches
to address them. These challenges arise from the heterogeneity of data and
devices, communication issues, and privacy concerns for clients in FL training.
Moreover, even well-established theoretical advances in FL require diverse
forms of practical implementation to enhance their real-world applicability.
Our contributions advance FL algorithms and systems, bridging theoretical
advancements and practical implementations. More broadly, our work serves as a
guide for researchers navigating the complexities of translating theoretical
methods into efficient real-world implementations and software. Additionally,
it offers insights into the reverse process of adapting practical
implementation aspects back into theoretical algorithm design. This reverse
process is particularly intriguing, as the practical perspective compels us to
examine the underlying mechanics and flexibilities of algorithms more deeply,
often uncovering new dimensions of the algorithms under study.

Conclusion: 提出的上下文学习机制有效增强了Credibility Transformer的性能，使其能够处理训练数据中未出现的新分类特征，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: The starting point of our network architecture is the Credibility Transformer
which extends the classical Transformer architecture by a credibility mechanism
to improve model learning and predictive performance. This Credibility
Transformer learns credibilitized CLS tokens that serve as learned
representations of the original input features. In this paper we present a new
paradigm that augments this architecture by an in-context learning mechanism,
i.e., we increase the information set by a context batch consisting of similar
instances. This allows the model to enhance the CLS token representations of
the instances by additional in-context information and fine-tuning. We
empirically verify that this in-context learning enhances predictive accuracy
by adapting to similar risk patterns. Moreover, this in-context learning also
allows the model to generalize to new instances which, e.g., have feature
levels in the categorical covariates that have not been present when the model
was trained -- for a relevant example, think of a new vehicle model which has
just been developed by a car manufacturer.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for predicting rare, high-impact outcomes by
integrating large language models (LLMs) with a multi-model machine learning
(ML) architecture. The approach combines the predictive strength of black-box
models with the interpretability required for reliable decision-making. We use
LLM-powered feature engineering to extract and synthesize complex signals from
unstructured data, which are then processed within a layered ensemble of models
including XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Regression. The ensemble first
produces a continuous estimate of success likelihood, which is then thresholded
to produce a binary rare-event prediction. We apply this framework to the
domain of Venture Capital (VC), where investors must evaluate startups with
limited and noisy early-stage data. The empirical results show strong
performance: the model achieves precision between 9.8X and 11.1X the random
classifier baseline in three independent test subsets. Feature sensitivity
analysis further reveals interpretable success drivers: the startup's category
list accounts for 15.6% of predictive influence, followed by the number of
founders, while education level and domain expertise contribute smaller yet
consistent effects.

Abstract: Fairness-aware classification requires balancing performance and fairness,
often intensified by intersectional biases. Conflicting fairness definitions
further complicate the task, making it difficult to identify universally fair
solutions. Despite growing regulatory and societal demands for equitable AI,
popular toolkits offer limited support for exploring multi-dimensional fairness
and related trade-offs. To address this, we present mmm-fair, an open-source
toolkit leveraging boosting-based ensemble approaches that dynamically
optimizes model weights to jointly minimize classification errors and diverse
fairness violations, enabling flexible multi-objective optimization. The system
empowers users to deploy models that align with their context-specific needs
while reliably uncovering intersectional biases often missed by
state-of-the-art methods. In a nutshell, mmm-fair uniquely combines in-depth
multi-attribute fairness, multi-objective optimization, a no-code, chat-based

selection, custom fairness constraint definition, and deployment-ready models
in a single open-source toolkit, a combination rarely found in existing

Abstract: Ensuring equitable treatment (fairness) across protected attributes (such as
gender or ethnicity) is a critical issue in machine learning. Most existing
literature focuses on binary classification, but achieving fairness in
regression tasks-such as insurance pricing or hiring score assessments-is
equally important. Moreover, anti-discrimination laws also apply to continuous
attributes, such as age, for which many existing methods are not applicable. In
practice, multiple protected attributes can exist simultaneously; however,
methods targeting fairness across several attributes often overlook so-called
"fairness gerrymandering", thereby ignoring disparities among intersectional
subgroups (e.g., African-American women or Hispanic men). In this paper, we
propose a distance covariance regularisation framework that mitigates the
association between model predictions and protected attributes, in line with
the fairness definition of demographic parity, and that captures both linear
and nonlinear dependencies. To enhance applicability in the presence of
multiple protected attributes, we extend our framework by incorporating two
multivariate dependence measures based on distance covariance: the previously
proposed joint distance covariance (JdCov) and our novel concatenated distance
covariance (CCdCov), which effectively address fairness gerrymandering in both
regression and classification tasks involving protected attributes of various
types. We discuss and illustrate how to calibrate regularisation strength,
including a method based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, which quantifies
dissimilarities in prediction distributions across groups. We apply our
framework to the COMPAS recidivism dataset and a large motor insurance claims
dataset.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MARLINE是一种新颖的多源迁移学习方法，用于处理非平稳环境中的概念漂移问题，即使源概念与目标概念不匹配也能有效利用多源知识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设至少有一个源模型代表与目标概念相似的概念，这在现实场景中往往不成立。需要一种能够在源概念与目标概念不匹配时仍能从多源数据中获益的方法

Method: 通过将目标概念投影到每个源概念的空间中，使多个源子分类器能够作为集成的一部分共同为目标概念的预测做出贡献

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，MARLINE比几种最先进的数据流学习方法更准确

Conclusion: MARLINE能够有效处理概念漂移问题，在源概念与目标概念不匹配的情况下仍能利用多源知识提升预测性能

Abstract: Concept drift is a major problem in online learning due to its impact on the
predictive performance of data stream mining systems. Recent studies have
started exploring data streams from different sources as a strategy to tackle
concept drift in a given target domain. These approaches make the assumption
that at least one of the source models represents a concept similar to the
target concept, which may not hold in many real-world scenarios. In this paper,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-source mApping with tRansfer LearnIng
for Non-stationary Environments (MARLINE). MARLINE can benefit from knowledge
from multiple data sources in non-stationary environments even when source and
target concepts do not match. This is achieved by projecting the target concept
to the space of each source concept, enabling multiple source sub-classifiers
to contribute towards the prediction of the target concept as part of an
ensemble. Experiments on several synthetic and real-world datasets show that
MARLINE was more accurate than several state-of-the-art data stream learning
approaches.

Method: 提出Domain Mixed Unit (DMU)，学习单一参数门来混合log空间和线性空间表示，执行加法或减法运算。提供两种初始化方法：一种覆盖加法和乘法，另一种覆盖减法和除法。

Result: 在NALM基准测试中达到最先进性能，在乘法和除法运算上获得所有种子中最高的解决百分比。

Conclusion: DMU是一种有效的神经算术单元，能够很好地泛化算术运算，特别是在乘除运算方面表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: The Domain Mixed Unit (DMU) is a new neural arithmetic unit that learns a
single parameter gate that mixes between log-space and linear-space
representations while performing either addition (DMU add) or subtraction (DMU
sub). Two initializations are proposed for the DMU: one covering addition and
multiplication, and another covering subtraction and division. The DMU achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the NALM Benchmark, a dataset designed to test
the ability of neural arithmetic units to generalize arithmetic operations,
specifically performing with the highest percentage solved over all seeds on
multiplication and division. The DMU will be submitted as a pull request to the
open-source NALM benchmark, and its code is available on GitHub at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签数据流中的标签概念经常在非平稳环境中发生漂移，现有研究对多标签数据流迁移学习的关注有限，需要利用相关标签间的知识转移来加速适应

Method: BR-MARLENE：利用源流和目标流中不同标签的知识进行多标签分类；BRPW-MARLENE：在基础上显式建模和迁移成对标签依赖关系以提升学习性能

Result: 综合实验表明两种方法在非平稳环境中都优于最先进的多标签流方法

Conclusion: 标签间知识转移对于提高预测性能具有显著效果，证明了所提方法的有效性

Abstract: Label concepts in multi-label data streams often experience drift in
non-stationary environments, either independently or in relation to other
labels. Transferring knowledge between related labels can accelerate
adaptation, yet research on multi-label transfer learning for data streams
remains limited. To address this, we propose two novel transfer learning
methods: BR-MARLENE leverages knowledge from different labels in both source
and target streams for multi-label classification; BRPW-MARLENE builds on this
by explicitly modelling and transferring pairwise label dependencies to enhance
learning performance. Comprehensive experiments show that both methods
outperform state-of-the-art multi-label stream approaches in non-stationary
environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of inter-label knowledge transfer
for improved predictive performance.

TL;DR: 深度强化学习AI系统在模拟大规模伤交事件中显著提升患者转运决策质量，让非专家达到专家水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模伤交事件中医疗系统过载，需要在极端压力下做出快速准确的患者-医院分配决策

Method: 开发深度强化学习AI经纪继续学习决策支持系统，建立MasTER网页管理面板，通过30名参与者的用户研究比较三种交互模式

Result: AI参与度提高显著改善决策质量和一致性，AI经纪继续学习超过伤外医生(p < 0.001)，让非专家在协作中达到专家水平

Conclusion: AI驱动的决策支持系统有潜力提升大规模伤交事件的预防训练和实际应急响应管理

Abstract: Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) overwhelm healthcare systems and demand rapid,
accurate patient-hospital allocation decisions under extreme pressure. Here, we
developed and validated a deep reinforcement learning-based decision-support AI
agent to optimize patient transfer decisions during simulated MCIs by balancing
patient acuity levels, specialized care requirements, hospital capacities, and
transport logistics. To integrate this AI agent, we developed MasTER, a
web-accessible command dashboard for MCI management simulations. Through a
controlled user study with 30 participants (6 trauma experts and 24
non-experts), we evaluated three interaction approaches with the AI agent
(human-only, human-AI collaboration, and AI-only) across 20- and 60-patient MCI
scenarios in the Greater Toronto Area. Results demonstrate that increasing AI
involvement significantly improves decision quality and consistency. The AI
agent outperforms trauma surgeons (p < 0.001) and enables non-experts to
achieve expert-level performance when assisted, contrasting sharply with their
significantly inferior unassisted performance (p < 0.001). These findings
establish the potential for our AI-driven decision support to enhance both MCI
preparedness training and real-world emergency response management.

*Francesco D'Angelo,Francesco Croce,Nicolas Flammarion*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新颖框架，展示Transformer如何动态处理因果结构，通过交错马尔可夫链揭示选择性归纳头的形成机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究依赖固定因果结构的马尔可夫链，无法捕捉自然语言中动态变化的token关系，需要探索Transformer如何选择正确因果结构。

Method: 使用具有不同滞后的交错马尔可夫链，保持转移概率固定但变化因果结构，通过3层Transformer实现选择性归纳头机制。

Result: Transformer学会了通过识别正确滞后并从过去复制相应token来预测下一个token，该机制渐近收敛于最大似然解。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了Transformer选择因果结构的能力，为理解其功能和可解释性提供了新见解，推进了对归纳头机制的认识。

Abstract: Transformers have exhibited exceptional capabilities in sequence modeling
tasks, leveraging self-attention and in-context learning. Critical to this
success are induction heads, attention circuits that enable copying tokens
based on their previous occurrences. In this work, we introduce a novel
framework that showcases transformers' ability to dynamically handle causal
structures. Existing works rely on Markov Chains to study the formation of
induction heads, revealing how transformers capture causal dependencies and
learn transition probabilities in-context. However, they rely on a fixed causal
structure that fails to capture the complexity of natural languages, where the
relationship between tokens dynamically changes with context. To this end, our
framework varies the causal structure through interleaved Markov chains with
different lags while keeping the transition probabilities fixed. This setting
unveils the formation of Selective Induction Heads, a new circuit that endows
transformers with the ability to select the correct causal structure
in-context. We empirically demonstrate that transformers learn this mechanism
to predict the next token by identifying the correct lag and copying the
corresponding token from the past. We provide a detailed construction of a
3-layer transformer to implement the selective induction head, and a
theoretical analysis proving that this mechanism asymptotically converges to
the maximum likelihood solution. Our findings advance the understanding of how
transformers select causal structures, providing new insights into their
functioning and interpretability.

*Hritik Arasu,Faisal R Jahangiri*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究使用生成对抗网络(WGAN-GP)和去噪液化模型来合成实际的EEG人工器官伪影数据，以解决EEG数据标注成本高的问题。结果显示WGAN-GP在谱对齐方面表现更好，但两种模型的类别条件恢复能力都较弱，限制了数据增强的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG中的人工器官伪影(肌肉、眼球运动、电极、咬喃、发抖等)会干扰自动化分析，但大规模标注成本高。研究了解现代生成模型是否能够合成实际的、带标签的伪影数据段。

Method: 使用TUH EEG Artifact(TUAR)数据集，比较条件WGAN-GP(带投影判别器)和1D去噪液化模型(带分类器免指导)。评估三个方面：保真度(谱密度、协方差、自相关、分布指标)、特异性(类别条件恢复)、实用性(数据增强效果)。

Result: WGAN-GP在谱对齐方面表现更好，与真实数据的MMD距离更小。但两种模型都显示出较弱的类别条件恢复能力，限制了立即的数据增强收益。

Conclusion: 研究为EEG伪影合成建立了可复现的基准线，揭示了当前模型在条件控制和覆盖率方面的不足，为未来工作指明了改进方向。

Abstract: Artifacts in electroencephalography (EEG) -- muscle, eye movement, electrode,
chewing, and shiver -- confound automated analysis yet are costly to label at
scale. We study whether modern generative models can synthesize realistic,
label-aware artifact segments suitable for augmentation and stress-testing.
Using the TUH EEG Artifact (TUAR) corpus, we curate subject-wise splits and
fixed-length multi-channel windows (e.g., 250 samples) with preprocessing
tailored to each model (per-window min-max for adversarial training;
per-recording/channel $z$-score for diffusion). We compare a conditional
WGAN-GP with a projection discriminator to a 1D denoising diffusion model with
classifier-free guidance, and evaluate along three axes: (i) fidelity via Welch
band-power deltas ($\Delta\delta,\ \Delta\theta,\ \Delta\alpha,\ \Delta\beta$),
channel-covariance Frobenius distance, autocorrelation $L_2$, and
distributional metrics (MMD/PRD); (ii) specificity via class-conditional
recovery with lightweight $k$NN/classifiers; and (iii) utility via augmentation
effects on artifact recognition. In our setting, WGAN-GP achieves closer
spectral alignment and lower MMD to real data, while both models exhibit weak
class-conditional recovery, limiting immediate augmentation gains and revealing
opportunities for stronger conditioning and coverage. We release a reproducible
pipeline -- data manifests, training configurations, and evaluation scripts --
to establish a baseline for EEG artifact synthesis and to surface actionable
failure modes for future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降阶模型在长时间预测时精度会下降，需要新的方法来保持长时间尺度下的预测准确性

Method: 1) 引入灵活、高阶且计算成本低的有限差分格式；2) 提出Rollout损失函数来训练降阶模型，使其能够在任意时间范围内做出准确预测

Result: 在2D Burgers方程上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著提升降阶模型在长时间尺度下的预测性能，为解决复杂偏微分方程提供了更有效的数值方法

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical
sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods.
Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction
to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized
families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We
address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive
finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to
make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our
approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Result: 在两个基准CSO问题（单阶段报童和两阶段运输规划）中，PS在异质性协变量空间始终优于最佳单一策略，在无异质性时收敛到主导策略

Conclusion: PS框架为上下文随机优化提供了一种数据驱动的策略选择方法，能够有效处理协变量空间的异质性

Abstract: We address the problem of policy selection in contextual stochastic
optimization (CSO), where covariates are available as contextual information
and decisions must satisfy hard feasibility constraints. In many CSO settings,
multiple candidate policies--arising from different modeling paradigms--exhibit
heterogeneous performance across the covariate space, with no single policy
uniformly dominating. We propose Prescribe-then-Select (PS), a modular
framework that first constructs a library of feasible candidate policies and
then learns a meta-policy to select the best policy for the observed
covariates. We implement the meta-policy using ensembles of Optimal Policy
Trees trained via cross-validation on the training set, making policy choice
entirely data-driven. Across two benchmark CSO problems--single-stage
newsvendor and two-stage shipment planning--PS consistently outperforms the
best single policy in heterogeneous regimes of the covariate space and
converges to the dominant policy when such heterogeneity is absent. All the

### [118] [Sketched Gaussian Mechanism for Private Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08195)
*Qiaobo Li,Zhijie Chen,Arindam Banerjee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM)，将梯度压缩的sketching技术与高斯机制结合，提供比单独分析更灵活和更强的隐私保护，隐私水平与sketching维度b的平方根成反比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中通信成本和隐私是两个主要考虑因素。现有文献对sketching和高斯机制的隐私分析是孤立的，需要一种联合分析方法来提供更灵活和更强的隐私保证。

Method: 提出SGM机制，直接结合sketching和高斯机制，使用Rényi-DP工具进行联合隐私分析，并应用于梯度下降或自适应服务器优化器的联邦学习。

Result: 理论证明SGM在固定噪声幅度下的隐私水平与1/√b成正比，实验表明在相同隐私级别下，基于SGM的联邦学习至少与非sketching的私有FL变体相当，在某些设置中表现更优。

Conclusion: SGM提供了比传统方法更强的隐私保证，自适应服务器优化器在保持隐私保证的同时提高了实证性能，收敛性仅对参数数量d有对数依赖。

Abstract: Communication cost and privacy are two major considerations in federated
learning (FL). For communication cost, gradient compression by sketching the
clients' transmitted model updates is often used for reducing per-round
communication. For privacy, the Gaussian mechanism (GM), which consists of
clipping updates and adding Gaussian noise, is commonly used to guarantee
client-level differential privacy. Existing literature on private FL analyzes
privacy of sketching and GM in an isolated manner, illustrating that sketching
provides privacy determined by the sketching dimension and that GM has to
supply any additional desired privacy.
  In this paper, we introduce the Sketched Gaussian Mechanism (SGM), which
directly combines sketching and the Gaussian mechanism for privacy. Using
R\'enyi-DP tools, we present a joint analysis of SGM's overall privacy
guarantee, which is significantly more flexible and sharper compared to
isolated analysis of sketching and GM privacy. In particular, we prove that the
privacy level of SGM for a fixed noise magnitude is proportional to
$1/\sqrt{b}$, where $b$ is the sketching dimension, indicating that (for
moderate $b$) SGM can provide much stronger privacy guarantees than the
original GM under the same noise budget. We demonstrate the application of SGM
to FL with either gradient descent or adaptive server optimizers, and establish
theoretical results on optimization convergence, which exhibits only a
logarithmic dependence on the number of parameters $d$. Experimental results
confirm that at the same privacy level, SGM based FL is at least competitive
with non-sketching private FL variants and outperforms them in some settings.
Moreover, using adaptive optimization at the server improves empirical
performance while maintaining the privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: 提出的自监督EDD框架为HAR提供了一种有效的解决方案，通过创新的数据增强技术和实证验证，证明了该方法在提高鲁棒性和可靠性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has seen significant advancements with the
adoption of deep learning techniques, yet challenges remain in terms of data
requirements, reliability and robustness. This paper explores a novel
application of Ensemble Distribution Distillation (EDD) within a
self-supervised learning framework for HAR aimed at overcoming these
challenges. By leveraging unlabeled data and a partially supervised training
strategy, our approach yields an increase in predictive accuracy, robust
estimates of uncertainty, and substantial increases in robustness against
adversarial perturbation; thereby significantly improving reliability in
real-world scenarios without increasing computational complexity at inference.
We demonstrate this with an evaluation on several publicly available datasets.
The contributions of this work include the development of a self-supervised EDD
framework, an innovative data augmentation technique designed for HAR, and
empirical validation of the proposed method's effectiveness in increasing
robustness and reliability.

Abstract: Distributed and federated learning are essential paradigms for training
models across decentralized data sources while preserving privacy, yet
communication overhead remains a major bottleneck. This dissertation explores
strategies to improve communication efficiency, focusing on model compression,
local training, and personalization. We establish a unified framework for
biased and unbiased compression operators with convergence guarantees, then
propose adaptive local training strategies that incorporate personalization to
accelerate convergence and mitigate client drift. In particular, Scafflix
balances global and personalized objectives, achieving superior performance
under both IID and non-IID settings. We further introduce privacy-preserving
pruning frameworks that optimize sparsity while minimizing communication costs,
with Cohort-Squeeze leveraging hierarchical aggregation to reduce cross-device
overhead. Finally, SymWanda, a symmetric post-training pruning method, enhances
robustness under high sparsity and maintains accuracy without retraining.
Extensive experiments on benchmarks and large-scale language models demonstrate
favorable trade-offs among accuracy, convergence, and communication, offering
theoretical and practical insights for scalable, efficient distributed
learning.

Motivation: 现有重症监护数据集如MIMIC和eICU在规模和多样性上有限，无法捕捉患者从ICU前到ICU后的完整诊疗历程，限制了临床AI研究的广度和泛化能力

Method: CRISP系统通过四个步骤处理数据：(1)透明的数据质量管理与审计追踪；(2)跨词汇表映射到统一SNOMED-CT标准；(3)模块化架构实现并行优化；(4)建立全面的基线模型基准

Result: CRISP能够在标准计算硬件上在1天内完成整个数据集处理，提供了处理管道、基线实现和详细转换文档

Conclusion: CRISP释放了CRITICAL数据集的全部潜力，使研究人员能够专注于推进临床AI研究，而无需花费数月时间进行数据预处理

Abstract: While existing critical care EHR datasets such as MIMIC and eICU have enabled
significant advances in clinical AI research, the CRITICAL dataset opens new
frontiers by providing extensive scale and diversity -- containing 1.95 billion
records from 371,365 patients across four geographically diverse CTSA
institutions. CRITICAL's unique strength lies in capturing full-spectrum
patient journeys, including pre-ICU, ICU, and post-ICU encounters across both
inpatient and outpatient settings. This multi-institutional, longitudinal
perspective creates transformative opportunities for developing generalizable
predictive models and advancing health equity research. However, the richness
of this multi-site resource introduces substantial complexity in data
harmonization, with heterogeneous collection practices and diverse vocabulary
usage patterns requiring sophisticated preprocessing approaches.
  We present CRISP to unlock the full potential of this valuable resource.
CRISP systematically transforms raw Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership
Common Data Model data into ML-ready datasets through: (1) transparent data
quality management with comprehensive audit trails, (2) cross-vocabulary
mapping of heterogeneous medical terminologies to unified SNOMED-CT standards,
with deduplication and unit standardization, (3) modular architecture with
parallel optimization enabling complete dataset processing in $<$1 day even on
standard computing hardware, and (4) comprehensive baseline model benchmarks
spanning multiple clinical prediction tasks to establish reproducible
performance standards. By providing processing pipeline, baseline
implementations, and detailed transformation documentation, CRISP saves
researchers months of preprocessing effort and democratizes access to
large-scale multi-institutional critical care data, enabling them to focus on
advancing clinical AI.

Conclusion: FAPM是一种有效的剪枝方法，能够显著减轻灾难性遗忘问题，同时保持优异的下游任务性能

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in various downstream tasks but typically face Catastrophic
Forgetting (CF) during fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose the
Forgetting-Aware Pruning Metric (FAPM), a novel pruning-based approach to
balance CF and downstream task performance. Our investigation reveals that the
degree to which task vectors (i.e., the subtraction of pre-trained weights from
the weights fine-tuned on downstream tasks) overlap with pre-trained model
parameters is a critical factor for CF. Based on this finding, FAPM employs the
ratio of the task vector to pre-trained model parameters as a metric to
quantify CF, integrating this measure into the pruning criteria. Importantly,
FAPM does not necessitate modifications to the training process or model
architecture, nor does it require any auxiliary data. We conducted extensive
experiments across eight datasets, covering natural language inference, General
Q&A, Medical Q&A, Math Q&A, reading comprehension, and cloze tests. The results
demonstrate that FAPM limits CF to just 0.25\% while maintaining 99.67\%
accuracy on downstream tasks. We provide the code to reproduce our results.

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) grow in sophistication, their ability to
perform reasoning is coming under increasing supervision. While they excel at
many tasks, their grasp of fundamental scientific principles, such as physics,
remains an underexplored frontier. To reflect the advancements in these
capabilities, we introduce a novel and accessible framework designed to
rigorously evaluate VLMs on their understanding of 2D physics. Our framework
features a pragmatic scenario generator that creates a diverse testbed of over
400 problems across four core domains: Projectile Motion, Collision Dynamics,
Mechanics, and Fluid Dynamics. Through comprehensive evaluation of four
state-of-the-art VLMs, we demonstrate a strong correlation between model scale
and reasoning ability, with our top-performing model, Qwen2.5-VL-7B, achieving
an overall score of 0.815. We find that while models excel at formulaic
problems, they struggle significantly with domains requiring abstract spatial
reasoning. By designing this framework, we aim to democratize the study of
scientific reasoning in VLMs and foster deeper insights into their capabilities
and limitations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于矩阵轮廓的加权集成方法(MPWE)，用于越南降雨量预测，通过动态捕捉地理模型间的协变依赖关系和冗余感知加权，在多个流域和时间尺度上实现了更高的预测精度和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越南降雨预测面临气候多样性和地理变异性的挑战，准确的预测对洪水管理、水电运营和灾害准备至关重要。现有地理模型预测存在局限性，需要集成方法来提高准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出矩阵轮廓基加权集成(MPWE)框架，采用机制切换方法动态捕捉多个地理模型预测间的协变依赖关系，并引入冗余感知加权机制来平衡各模型的贡献。

Result: 在越南8个主要流域的5个预测时间尺度(1小时及12-84小时累积降雨)上测试，MPWE相比地理模型和集成基线方法，预测误差的均值和标准差均显著降低。

Conclusion: MPWE框架能够有效提高降雨预测的准确性和稳定性，在不同流域和时间尺度上均表现出优越性能，为越南复杂气候条件下的降雨预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Rainfall forecasting in Vietnam is highly challenging due to its diverse
climatic conditions and strong geographical variability across river basins,
yet accurate and reliable forecasts are vital for flood management, hydropower
operation, and disaster preparedness. In this work, we propose a Matrix
Profile-based Weighted Ensemble (MPWE), a regime-switching framework that
dynamically captures covariant dependencies among multiple geographical model
forecasts while incorporating redundancy-aware weighting to balance
contributions across models. We evaluate MPWE using rainfall forecasts from
eight major basins in Vietnam, spanning five forecast horizons (1 hour and
accumulated rainfall over 12, 24, 48, 72, and 84 hours). Experimental results
show that MPWE consistently achieves lower mean and standard deviation of
prediction errors compared to geographical models and ensemble baselines,
demonstrating both improved accuracy and stability across basins and horizons.

TL;DR: FoQuS通过选择核心集来近似完整训练效果，显著减少自动调制识别模型的训练开销，仅需1%-30%数据即可保持高精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习自动调制识别模型需要大量标注数据，但重复训练的时间和能耗成本过高，需要找到降低训练开销的方法

Method: FoQuS记录完整训练过程中每个样本的预测轨迹，基于训练动态构建三个重要性指标来选择核心集

Result: 在多个AMR数据集上，FoQuS仅使用1%-30%的原始数据就能维持高识别精度，并具有良好的跨架构泛化能力

Conclusion: FoQuS通过智能选择核心集有效解决了大规模数据训练的高开销问题，为AMR模型开发提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Deep learning-based Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) model has made
significant progress with the support of large-scale labeled data. However,
when developing new models or performing hyperparameter tuning, the time and
energy consumption associated with repeated training using massive amounts of
data are often unbearable. To address the above challenges, we propose
\emph{FoQuS}, which approximates the effect of full training by selecting a
coreset from the original dataset, thereby significantly reducing training
overhead. Specifically, \emph{FoQuS} records the prediction trajectory of each
sample during full-dataset training and constructs three importance metrics
based on training dynamics. Experiments show that \emph{FoQuS} can maintain
high recognition accuracy and good cross-architecture generalization on
multiple AMR datasets using only 1\%-30\% of the original data.

TL;DR: EvolKV是一个自适应KV缓存压缩框架，通过进化搜索动态配置各层缓存预算，在保持任务性能的同时显著提升内存效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法依赖启发式策略，忽略了层间特征模式与任务性能的关键交互作用，导致泛化能力下降

Method: 将缓存分配重新表述为多目标优化问题，利用进化搜索动态配置各层预算，直接最大化下游任务性能

Result: 在11个任务上超越所有基线方法，在长上下文任务上表现优异，在GSM8K上比启发式基线提升7个百分点，仅用1.5%原始预算就能在代码补全任务上超越完整KV缓存性能

Conclusion: EvolKV展示了学习式KV缓存预算分配策略的未开发潜力，为高效内存使用和任务性能优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods typically rely on
heuristics, such as uniform cache allocation across layers or static eviction
policies, however, they ignore the critical interplays among layer-specific
feature patterns and task performance, which can lead to degraded
generalization. In this paper, we propose EvolKV, an adaptive framework for
layer-wise, task-driven KV cache compression that jointly optimizes the memory
efficiency and task performance. By reformulating cache allocation as a
multi-objective optimization problem, EvolKV leverages evolutionary search to
dynamically configure layer budgets while directly maximizing downstream
performance. Extensive experiments on 11 tasks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms all baseline methods across a wide range of KV cache budgets on
long-context tasks and surpasses heuristic baselines by up to 7 percentage
points on GSM8K. Notably, EvolKV achieves superior performance over the full KV
cache setting on code completion while utilizing only 1.5% of the original
budget, suggesting the untapped potential in learned compression strategies for
KV cache budget allocation.

TL;DR: 使用预训练大语言模型作为导师来加速强化学习训练收敛，通过学生-教师架构提供指导，实验表明能显著减少训练时间但重用建议会导致收敛不稳定


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习算法在复杂稀疏奖励环境中需要长时间训练，现有加速技术如奖励塑造和课程学习需要领域专业知识且过于特定

Method: 采用学生-教师架构，使用LLM（Llama、Vicuna、DeepSeek）作为导师为RL算法（DQN、PPO、A2C）提供指导，在多种环境（Blackjack、Snake、Connect Four）中进行54种配置实验

Result: LLM指导显著加速RL收敛同时保持可比的最优性能，建议重用机制进一步缩短训练时间但导致收敛动态不稳定

Conclusion: LLM指导总体上改善收敛效果，但其有效性对具体任务、RL算法和LLM模型组合敏感

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms often require long training to become
useful, especially in complex environments with sparse rewards. While
techniques like reward shaping and curriculum learning exist to accelerate
training, these are often extremely specific and require the developer's
professionalism and dedicated expertise in the problem's domain. Tackling this
challenge, in this study, we explore the effectiveness of pre-trained Large
Language Models (LLMs) as tutors in a student-teacher architecture with RL
algorithms, hypothesizing that LLM-generated guidance allows for faster
convergence. In particular, we explore the effectiveness of reusing the LLM's
advice on the RL's convergence dynamics. Through an extensive empirical
examination, which included 54 configurations, varying the RL algorithm (DQN,
PPO, A2C), LLM tutor (Llama, Vicuna, DeepSeek), and environment (Blackjack,
Snake, Connect Four), our results demonstrate that LLM tutoring significantly
accelerates RL convergence while maintaining comparable optimal performance.
Furthermore, the advice reuse mechanism shows a further improvement in training
duration but also results in less stable convergence dynamics. Our findings
suggest that LLM tutoring generally improves convergence, and its effectiveness
is sensitive to the specific task, RL algorithm, and LLM model combination.

TL;DR: MoEpic是一个高效的MoE推理系统，通过专家分割机制和预测预取策略，在减少GPU内存占用的同时显著提升推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型参数庞大，GPU内存需求高，专家缓存命中率低且加载延迟大，限制了MoE LLMs的广泛应用

Method: 提出专家垂直分割机制，将专家分为顶部和底部段，缓存热门专家的顶部段；预测下一层激活专家并预取；基于定点迭代的自适应缓存配置算法

Result: 实验表明MoEpic可节省约一半GPU成本，推理延迟降低37.51%-65.73%

Conclusion: MoEpic通过创新的专家分割和缓存策略，有效解决了MoE推理中的内存和性能瓶颈问题

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising architecture for modern
large language models (LLMs). However, massive parameters impose heavy GPU
memory (i.e., VRAM) demands, hindering the widespread adoption of MoE LLMs.
Offloading the expert parameters to CPU RAM offers an effective way to
alleviate the VRAM requirements for MoE inference. Existing approaches
typically cache a small subset of experts in VRAM and dynamically prefetch
experts from RAM during inference, leading to significant degradation in
inference speed due to the poor cache hit rate and substantial expert loading
latency. In this work, we propose MoEpic, an efficient MoE inference system
with a novel expert split mechanism. Specifically, each expert is vertically
divided into two segments: top and bottom. MoEpic caches the top segment of hot
experts, so that more experts will be stored under the limited VRAM budget,
thereby improving the cache hit rate. During each layer's inference, MoEpic
predicts and prefetches the activated experts for the next layer. Since the top
segments of cached experts are exempt from fetching, the loading time is
reduced, which allows efficient transfer-computation overlap. Nevertheless, the
performance of MoEpic critically depends on the cache configuration (i.e., each
layer's VRAM budget and expert split ratio). To this end, we propose a
divide-and-conquer algorithm based on fixed-point iteration for adaptive cache
configuration. Extensive experiments on popular MoE LLMs demonstrate that
MoEpic can save about half of the GPU cost, while lowering the inference
latency by about 37.51%-65.73% compared to the baselines.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过扰动决策损失梯度来结合预测损失梯度的方法，在决策导向学习中实现更稳定的训练和更好的决策质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预测导向学习(PFL)和决策导向学习(DFL)各有优缺点：PFL训练稳定但忽略下游决策质量，DFL直接优化决策质量但存在收敛不稳定问题

Method: 使用预测损失梯度扰动决策损失梯度来构建更新方向，通过sigmoid-like衰减参数让预测损失梯度指导决策损失梯度，无需额外训练即可与任何DFL求解器集成

Result: 在三个随机优化问题上验证了方法的有效性，相比基线方法实现了更低的遗憾值和更稳定的训练，在PFL或DFL单独表现不佳的情况下也能取得良好效果

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功结合了PFL的稳定性和DFL的决策质量优化优势，具有理论收敛保证和实际应用价值

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is often considered in two stages:
predicting the unknown parameters, and then optimizing decisions based on
predictions. While traditional prediction-focused learning (PFL) treats these
two stages separately, decision-focused learning (DFL) trains the predictive
model by directly optimizing the decision quality in an end-to-end manner.
However, despite using exact or well-approximated gradients, vanilla DFL often
suffers from unstable convergence due to its flat-and-sharp loss landscapes. In
contrast, PFL yields more stable optimization, but overlooks the downstream
decision quality. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective approach:
perturbing the decision loss gradient using the prediction loss gradient to
construct an update direction. Our method requires no additional training and
can be integrated with any DFL solvers. Using the sigmoid-like decaying
parameter, we let the prediction loss gradient guide the decision loss gradient
to train a predictive model that optimizes decision quality. Also, we provide a
theoretical convergence guarantee to Pareto stationary point under mild
assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate our method across three stochastic
optimization problems, showing promising results compared to other baselines.
We validate that our approach achieves lower regret with more stable training,
even in situations where either PFL or DFL struggles.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中更现实的类别不平衡问题，包括源域和目标域的类别不平衡、域间标签偏移以及目标客户端间的非独立同分布问题

Method: 将FFREEDA框架的主干网络替换为冻结的视觉基础模型(VFM)，避免大量参数调优，同时减少联邦学习中的计算和通信开销

Result: 实验结果表明VFM能有效缓解域差距、类别不平衡和客户端非独立同分布问题的影响，显著提高整体准确率

Conclusion: 强大的特征提取器比复杂的域适应或联邦学习方法更关键，视觉基础模型是解决现实世界联邦学习问题的有效方案

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) offers a framework for training models
collaboratively while preserving data privacy of each client. Recently,
research has focused on Federated Source-Free Domain Adaptation (FFREEDA), a
more realistic scenario wherein client-held target domain data remains
unlabeled, and the server can access source domain data only during
pre-training. We extend this framework to a more complex and realistic setting:
Class Imbalanced FFREEDA (CI-FFREEDA), which takes into account class
imbalances in both the source and target domains, as well as label shifts
between source and target and among target clients. The replication of existing
methods in our experimental setup lead us to rethink the focus from enhancing
aggregation and domain adaptation methods to improving the feature extractors
within the network itself. We propose replacing the FFREEDA backbone with a
frozen vision foundation model (VFM), thereby improving overall accuracy
without extensive parameter tuning and reducing computational and communication
costs in federated learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that VFMs
effectively mitigate the effects of domain gaps, class imbalances, and even
non-IID-ness among target clients, suggesting that strong feature extractors,
not complex adaptation or FL methods, are key to success in the real-world FL.

Result: 在真实LLM输出上实现24-35倍的延迟降低，提供强理论保证证明cutmax快速收敛到唯一两级固定点

Conclusion: 这些技术显著推进了安全文本生成的发展，为隐私保护环境下的高效LLM推理提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MoT（Mixture-of-Tinkers）方法来解决图基础模型在跨域预训练中的两个主要问题：模型退化和表示坍塌，通过信息调整和正则化调整来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图基础模型（GFM）在处理多域图数据时面临域泛化冲突，具体表现为模型退化（无法捕捉输入多样性）和表示坍塌（语义可分性丧失），这两个问题共同导致预训练优化困境。

Method: 提出MoT框架，包含：(1)信息调整器：使用边级语义融合策略和具有域感知路由的混合码本来提升信息容量；(2)正则化调整器：通过两个额外的正则化来改进梯度监督。

Result: 在6个领域的22个数据集上的实验表明，MoT在监督学习、少样本和零样本场景下均显著优于现有最佳基线方法。

Conclusion: MoT通过解决信息瓶颈和正则化缺失问题，有效提升了图基础模型的跨域泛化能力，且遵循GFM的缩放定律，提供了可控的模型规模。

Abstract: Graph foundation models, inspired by the success of LLMs, are designed to
learn the optimal embedding from multi-domain TAGs for the downstream
cross-task generalization capability. During our investigation, graph VQ-MAE
stands out among the increasingly diverse landscape of GFM architectures. This
is attributed to its ability to jointly encode topology and textual attributes
from multiple domains into discrete embedding spaces with clear semantic
boundaries. Despite its potential, domain generalization conflicts cause
imperceptible pitfalls. In this paper, we instantiate two of them, and they are
just like two sides of the same GFM optimization coin - Side 1 Model
Degradation: The encoder and codebook fail to capture the diversity of inputs;
Side 2 Representation Collapse: The hidden embedding and codebook vector fail
to preserve semantic separability due to constraints from narrow representation
subspaces. These two pitfalls (sides) collectively impair the decoder and
generate the low-quality reconstructed supervision, causing the GFM
optimization dilemma during pre-training (coin). Through empirical
investigation, we attribute the above challenges to Information Bottleneck and
Regularization Deficit. To address them, we propose MoT (Mixture-of-Tinkers) -
(1) Information Tinker for Two Pitfalls, which utilizes an edge-wise semantic
fusion strategy and a mixture-of-codebooks with domain-aware routing to improve
information capacity. (2) Regularization Tinker for Optimization Coin, which
utilizes two additional regularizations to further improve gradient supervision
in our proposed Information Tinker. Notably, as a flexible architecture, MoT
adheres to the scaling laws of GFM, offering a controllable model scale.
Compared to SOTA baselines, experiments on 22 datasets across 6 domains
demonstrate that MoT achieves significant improvements in supervised, few-shot,
and zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable capacity to process and reason over structured and unstructured data
modalities beyond natural language. In this work, we explore the applications
of Vision Language Models (VLMs), specifically a fine-tuned variant of LLaMa
3.2, to the task of identifying neutrino interactions in pixelated detector
data from high-energy physics (HEP) experiments. We benchmark this model
against a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture,
similar to those used in the NOvA and DUNE experiments, which have achieved
high efficiency and purity in classifying electron and muon neutrino events.
Our evaluation considers both the classification performance and
interpretability of the model predictions. We find that VLMs can outperform
CNNs, while also providing greater flexibility in integrating auxiliary textual
or semantic information and offering more interpretable, reasoning-based
predictions. This work highlights the potential of VLMs as a general-purpose
backbone for physics event classification, due to their high performance,
interpretability, and generalizability, which opens new avenues for integrating
multimodal reasoning in experimental neutrino physics.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Actuarial Neural Additive Model, an inherently
interpretable deep learning model for general insurance pricing that offers
fully transparent and interpretable results while retaining the strong
predictive power of neural networks. This model assigns a dedicated neural
network (or subnetwork) to each individual covariate and pairwise interaction
term to independently learn its impact on the modeled output while implementing
various architectural constraints to allow for essential interpretability (e.g.
sparsity) and practical requirements (e.g. smoothness, monotonicity) in
insurance applications. The development of our model is grounded in a solid
foundation, where we establish a concrete definition of interpretability within
the insurance context, complemented by a rigorous mathematical framework.
Comparisons in terms of prediction accuracy are made with traditional actuarial
and state-of-the-art machine learning methods using both synthetic and real
insurance datasets. The results show that the proposed model outperforms other
methods in most cases while offering complete transparency in its internal
logic, underscoring the strong interpretability and predictive capability.

Conclusion: 该方法能够系统评估流程挖掘算法对不同事件日志特征的鲁棒性，为算法选择和性能评估提供更全面的分析框架

Abstract: Process mining aims to extract and analyze insights from event logs, yet
algorithm metric results vary widely depending on structural event log
characteristics. Existing work often evaluates algorithms on a fixed set of
real-world event logs but lacks a systematic analysis of how event log
characteristics impact algorithms individually. Moreover, since event logs are
generated from processes, where characteristics co-occur, we focus on
associational rather than causal effects to assess how strong the overlapping
individual characteristic affects evaluation metrics without assuming isolated
causal effects, a factor often neglected by prior work. We introduce SHAining,
the first approach to quantify the marginal contribution of varying event log
characteristics to process mining algorithms' metrics. Using process discovery
as a downstream task, we analyze over 22,000 event logs covering a wide span of
characteristics to uncover which affect algorithms across metrics (e.g.,
fitness, precision, complexity) the most. Furthermore, we offer novel insights
about how the value of event log characteristics correlates with their
contributed impact, assessing the algorithm's robustness.

Conclusion: 研究为理解重球动量梯度下降的主要特征提供了新视角，为其他优化算法的类似分析提供了路线图，理论结果适用于全批次和小批次HB。

Abstract: We analyze gradient descent with Polyak heavy-ball momentum (HB) whose fixed
momentum parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$ provides exponential decay of memory.
Building on Kovachki and Stuart (2021), we prove that on an exponentially
attractive invariant manifold the algorithm is exactly plain gradient descent
with a modified loss, provided that the step size $h$ is small enough. Although
the modified loss does not admit a closed-form expression, we describe it with
arbitrary precision and prove global (finite "time" horizon) approximation
bounds $O(h^{R})$ for any finite order $R \geq 2$. We then conduct a
fine-grained analysis of the combinatorics underlying the memoryless
approximations of HB, in particular, finding a rich family of polynomials in
$\beta$ hidden inside which contains Eulerian and Narayana polynomials. We
derive continuous modified equations of arbitrary approximation order (with
rigorous bounds) and the principal flow that approximates the HB dynamics,
generalizing Rosca et al. (2023). Approximation theorems cover both full-batch
and mini-batch HB. Our theoretical results shed new light on the main features
of gradient descent with heavy-ball momentum, and outline a road-map for
similar analysis of other optimization algorithms.

Method: 使用心脏病数据集训练多层感知机模型，在一致的训练范式下比较10种优化器的性能，评估指标包括收敛速度、稳定性、AUC、精度和召回率。

Result: RMSProp表现最佳：精度0.765、召回率0.827、AUC 0.841，训练时间快，但稳定性不如Adagrad和Adadelta。稳定性高的优化器收敛速度慢。

Conclusion: 优化器选择存在权衡，RMSProp在心脏病预测任务中表现最佳。建议在计算资源充足时采用系统性评估方法来选择优化器。

Abstract: Optimization has been an important factor and topic of interest in training
deep learning models, yet less attention has been given to how we select the
optimizers we use to train these models. Hence, there is a need to dive deeper
into how we select the optimizers we use for training and the metrics that
determine this selection. In this work, we compare the performance of 10
different optimizers in training a simple Multi-layer Perceptron model using a
heart disease dataset from Kaggle. We set up a consistent training paradigm and
evaluate the optimizers based on metrics such as convergence speed and
stability. We also include some other Machine Learning Evaluation metrics such
as AUC, Precision, and Recall, which are central metrics to classification
problems. Our results show that there are trade-offs between convergence speed
and stability, as optimizers like Adagrad and Adadelta, which are more stable,
took longer time to converge. Across all our metrics, we chose RMSProp to be
the most effective optimizer for this heart disease prediction task because it
offered a balanced performance across key metrics. It achieved a precision of
0.765, a recall of 0.827, and an AUC of 0.841, along with faster training time.
However, it was not the most stable. We recommend that, in less
compute-constrained environments, this method of choosing optimizers through a
thorough evaluation should be adopted to increase the scientific nature and
performance in training deep learning models.

Conclusion: 结构化潜在表示对算子学习至关重要，生成模型与算子网络的结合在热设计和更广泛的工程应用中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the efficiency and scalability of pairwise
constraint-based active clustering, crucial for processing large-scale data in
applications such as data mining, knowledge annotation, and AI model
pre-training. Our goals are threefold: (1) to reduce computational costs for
iterative clustering updates; (2) to enhance the impact of user-provided
constraints to minimize annotation requirements for precise clustering; and (3)
to cut down memory usage in practical deployments. To achieve these aims, we
propose a graph-based active clustering algorithm that utilizes two sparse
graphs: one for representing relationships between data (our proposed data
skeleton) and another for updating this data skeleton. These two graphs work in
concert, enabling the refinement of connected subgraphs within the data
skeleton to create nested clusters. Our empirical analysis confirms that the
proposed algorithm consistently facilitates more accurate clustering with
dramatically less input of user-provided constraints, and outperforms its
counterparts in terms of computational performance and scalability, while
maintaining robustness across various distance metrics.

Abstract: Timely and robust influenza incidence forecasting is critical for public
health decision-making. To address this, we present MAESTRO, a Multi-modal
Adaptive Ensemble for Spectro-Temporal Robust Optimization. MAESTRO achieves
robustness by adaptively fusing multi-modal inputs-including surveillance, web
search trends, and meteorological data-and leveraging a comprehensive
spectro-temporal architecture. The model first decomposes time series into
seasonal and trend components. These are then processed through a hybrid
feature enhancement pipeline combining Transformer-based encoders, a Mamba
state-space model for long-range dependencies, multi-scale temporal
convolutions, and a frequency-domain analysis module. A cross-channel attention
mechanism further integrates information across the different data modalities.
Finally, a temporal projection head performs sequence-to-sequence forecasting,
with an optional estimator to quantify prediction uncertainty. Evaluated on
over 11 years of Hong Kong influenza data (excluding the COVID-19 period),
MAESTRO shows strong competitive performance, demonstrating a superior model
fit and relative accuracy, achieving a state-of-the-art R-square of 0.956.
Extensive ablations confirm the significant contributions of both multi-modal
fusion and the spectro-temporal components. Our modular and reproducible
pipeline is made publicly available to facilitate deployment and extension to
other regions and pathogens.Our publicly available pipeline presents a
powerful, unified framework, demonstrating the critical synergy of advanced
spectro-temporal modeling and multi-modal data fusion for robust
epidemiological forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文主张将可解释性特别是机制性方法作为对齐的核心设计原则，而非辅助诊断工具，认为这是实现安全可信AI的关键


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型神经模型在高风险场景部署时存在与人类价值观对齐的可靠性问题，需要内部透明度来确保系统行为符合人类意图

Method: 区分事后解释方法（如LIME、SHAP）和机制性技术（如电路追踪、激活修补），强调后者能提供对内部故障的因果洞察

Result: 机制性可解释性方法能够揭示行为方法可能忽略的欺骗性或未对齐推理模式，但面临可扩展性、认知不确定性和表征-概念不匹配等挑战

Conclusion: AI安全和可信赖的进展取决于将可解释性作为AI研发的一等目标，确保系统不仅有效而且可审计、透明且与人类意图对齐

Abstract: Large neural models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes settings,
raising concerns about whether their behavior reliably aligns with human
values. Interpretability provides a route to internal transparency by revealing
the computations that drive outputs. We argue that interpretability especially
mechanistic approaches should be treated as a design principle for alignment,
not an auxiliary diagnostic tool. Post-hoc methods such as LIME or SHAP offer
intuitive but correlational explanations, while mechanistic techniques like
circuit tracing or activation patching yield causal insight into internal
failures, including deceptive or misaligned reasoning that behavioral methods
like RLHF, red teaming, or Constitutional AI may overlook. Despite these
advantages, interpretability faces challenges of scalability, epistemic
uncertainty, and mismatches between learned representations and human concepts.
Our position is that progress on safe and trustworthy AI will depend on making
interpretability a first-class objective of AI research and development,
ensuring that systems are not only effective but also auditable, transparent,
and aligned with human intent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 深度学习算法使用原始加速度信号在24小时运动行为分类中表现略好于传统机器学习算法，准确度约85%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较深度学习和传统机器学习算法在24小时运动行为分类任务中的性能差异

Method: 使用151名成年人的手腕加速计数据，采用4种DL算法（LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU、1D-CNN）和6种传统ML算法，分别使用原始信号和手工特征进行训练

Result: DL算法使用原始信号达到85%准确度，传统ML算法使用手工特征达到70-81%准确度，MVPA和LPA分类错误较高

Conclusion: 深度学习方法使用原始加速度信号在预测24小时运动行为强度时仅略好于使用手工特征的深度学习和传统机器学习算法

Abstract: Purpose: We compared the performance of deep learning (DL) and classical
machine learning (ML) algorithms for the classification of 24-hour movement
behavior into sleep, sedentary, light intensity physical activity (LPA), and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Methods: Open-access
data from 151 adults wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer (Axivity-AX3) was used.
Participants were randomly divided into training, validation, and test sets
(121, 15, and 15 participants each). Raw acceleration signals were segmented
into non-overlapping 10-second windows, and then a total of 104 handcrafted
features were extracted. Four DL algorithms-Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN)-were trained using raw
acceleration signals and with handcrafted features extracted from these signals
to predict 24-hour movement behavior categories. The handcrafted features were
also used to train classical ML algorithms, namely Random Forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic Regression
(LR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Decision Tree (DT) for classifying
24-hour movement behavior intensities. Results: LSTM, BiLSTM, and GRU showed an
overall accuracy of approximately 85% when trained with raw acceleration
signals, and 1D-CNN an overall accuracy of approximately 80%. When trained on
handcrafted features, the overall accuracy for both DL and classical ML
algorithms ranged from 70% to 81%. Overall, there was a higher confusion in
classification of MVPA and LPA, compared to sleep and sedentary categories.
Conclusion: DL methods with raw acceleration signals had only slightly better
performance in predicting 24-hour movement behavior intensities, compared to
when DL and classical ML were trained with handcrafted features.

Motivation: 虽然针对表格数据的DNN在预测性能上具有竞争力，但它们是黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性，这在金融和医疗等关键领域是一个重要问题

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器(SAE)在预测潜在空间中学习单语义特征字典，并通过自动化方法为这些特征分配人类可解释的语义，使预测可以表示为语义有意义组件的线性组合

Conclusion: XNNTab成功解决了表格数据神经网络的可解释性问题，在保持高性能的同时提供了透明的预测解释，为关键领域的应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: Tabular data is the foundation of many applications in fields such as finance
and healthcare. Although DNNs tailored for tabular data achieve competitive
predictive performance, they are blackboxes with little interpretability. We
introduce XNNTab, a neural architecture that uses a sparse autoencoder (SAE) to
learn a dictionary of monosemantic features within the latent space used for
prediction. Using an automated method, we assign human-interpretable semantics
to these features. This allows us to represent predictions as linear
combinations of semantically meaningful components. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate that XNNTab attains performance on par with or exceeding that of
state-of-the-art, black-box neural models and classical machine learning
approaches while being fully interpretable.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对轮廓系数的新上界计算方法，通过为每个数据点推导尖锐的上界，并聚合得到数据集相关的ASW上界，改进了聚类质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的轮廓系数ASW上限1通常无法达到，且数据集特定的最大ASW值未知，需要更精确的上界来评估聚类质量。

Method: 为每个数据点推导尖锐的轮廓宽度上界，通过聚合这些个体界限得到数据集依赖的ASW上界。

Result: 提出的界限在合成和真实数据集上被证明接近紧致，显著丰富了聚类质量评估能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够指示数据点是否能够被良好放置，支持基于轮廓的优化循环早期停止，并帮助评估聚类结果与最佳可能结果的接近程度。

Abstract: The silhouette coefficient summarizes, per observation, cohesion versus
separation in [-1, 1]; the average silhouette width (ASW) is a common internal
measure of clustering quality where higher values indicate more coveted
results. However, the dataset-specific maximum of ASW is typically unknown, and
the standard upper limit 1 is often unattainable. In this work, we derive for
each data point in a given dataset a sharp upper bound on its silhouette width.
By aggregating these individual bounds, we present a canonical data-dependent
upper bound on ASW that often assumes values well below 1. The presented bounds
can indicate whether individual data points can ever be well placed, enable
early stopping of silhouette-based optimization loops, and help answer a key
question: How close is my clustering result to the best possible outcome on
this specific data? Across synthetic and real datasets, the bounds are provably
near-tight in many cases and offer significant enrichment of cluster quality
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大模型训练数据需求快速增长，公开数据将在未来几年内靠毫。用户生成内容虽然丰富，但包含私密信息和不良内容，直接使用带来风险。

Method: 通过预训练生成模型对每个真实数据示例进行条件生成，产生保持原始数据多样性的合成数据，同时去除私密信息和毒性内容。

Conclusion: GDR的简单性和有效性使其成为扩大前沿模型训练数据总量的强大工具，有力解决训练数据靠毫挑战。

Abstract: For a fixed parameter size, the capabilities of large models are primarily
determined by the quality and quantity of its training data. Consequently,
training datasets now grow faster than the rate at which new data is indexed on
the web, leading to projected data exhaustion over the next decade. Much more
data exists as user-generated content that is not publicly indexed, but
incorporating such data comes with considerable risks, such as leaking private
information and other undesirable content. We introduce a framework, Generative
Data Refinement (GDR), for using pretrained generative models to transform a
dataset with undesirable content into a refined dataset that is more suitable
for training. Our experiments show that GDR can outperform industry-grade
solutions for dataset anonymization, as well as enable direct detoxification of
highly unsafe datasets. Moreover, we show that by generating synthetic data
that is conditioned on each example in the real dataset, GDR's refined outputs
naturally match the diversity of web scale datasets, and thereby avoid the
often challenging task of generating diverse synthetic data via model
prompting. The simplicity and effectiveness of GDR make it a powerful tool for
scaling up the total stock of training data for frontier models.

Abstract: Replication of experimental results has been a challenge faced by many
scientific disciplines, including the field of machine learning. Recent work on
the theory of machine learning has formalized replicability as the demand that
an algorithm produce identical outcomes when executed twice on different
samples from the same distribution. Provably replicable algorithms are
especially interesting for reinforcement learning (RL), where algorithms are
known to be unstable in practice. While replicable algorithms exist for tabular
RL settings, extending these guarantees to more practical function
approximation settings has remained an open problem. In this work, we make
progress by developing replicable methods for linear function approximation in
RL. We first introduce two efficient algorithms for replicable random design
regression and uncentered covariance estimation, each of independent interest.
We then leverage these tools to provide the first provably efficient replicable
RL algorithms for linear Markov decision processes in both the generative model
and episodic settings. Finally, we evaluate our algorithms experimentally and
show how they can inspire more consistent neural policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在不同医疗系统间的性能退化是一个重要问题，主要因素是诊断信号衰减，即不同机构在诊断质量和一致性上的变异影响了训练和预测所用代码的可靠性。

Method: 研究构建了一个模拟框架，生成了2,500个合成数据集，每个包含1,000名患者。从六个可解释的组件得出SFI：诊断特异性、时间一致性、熵、上下文一致性、药物对齐和趋势稳定性。应用了SFI敏感的检测检验方法。

Result: 在最优参数(α = 2.0)时，SFI敏感检测检验显著提高了所有指标(p < 0.001)。从平衡准确率10.3%到回归率32.5%，精度31.9%和F1分数26.1%。性能接近参考标准，F1分数和回归率均在1%以内。

Conclusion: 诊断信号衰减是模型普适化的可处理障碍。SFI敏感检测检验提供了一种实用的、无标签的策略，可在缺乏结果标签的大规模管理数据集中提高预测性能。

Abstract: \textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy
to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, particularly for large-scale
administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.

Abstract: In federated learning, multiple parties train models locally and share their
parameters with a central server, which aggregates them to update a global
model. To address the risk of exposing sensitive data through local models,
secure aggregation via secure multiparty computation has been proposed to
enhance privacy. At the same time, perfect privacy can only be achieved by a
uniform distribution of the masked local models to be aggregated. This raises a
problem when working with real valued data, as there is no measure on the reals
that is invariant under the masking operation, and hence information leakage is
bound to occur. Shifting the data to a finite field circumvents this problem,
but as a downside runs into an inherent accuracy complexity tradeoff issue due
to fixed point modular arithmetic as opposed to floating point numbers that can
simultaneously handle numbers of varying magnitudes. In this paper, a novel
secure parameter aggregation method is proposed that employs the torus rather
than a finite field. This approach guarantees perfect privacy for each party's
data by utilizing the uniform distribution on the torus, while avoiding
accuracy losses. Experimental results show that the new protocol performs
similarly to the model without secure aggregation while maintaining perfect
privacy. Compared to the finite field secure aggregation, the torus-based
protocol can in some cases significantly outperform it in terms of model
accuracy and cosine similarity, hence making it a safer choice.

Conclusion: FAUST算法成功解决了前向-前向算法的准确率和效率问题，使其在保持生物可信性的同时接近反向传播的性能表现

Abstract: Backpropagation is the pivotal algorithm underpinning the success of
artificial neural networks, yet it has critical limitations such as
biologically implausible backward locking and global error propagation. To
circumvent these constraints, the Forward-Forward algorithm was proposed as a
more biologically plausible method that replaces the backward pass with an
additional forward pass. Despite this advantage, the Forward-Forward algorithm
significantly trails backpropagation in accuracy, and its optimal form exhibits
low inference efficiency due to multiple forward passes required. In this work,
the Forward-Forward algorithm is reshaped through its integration with
similarity learning frameworks, eliminating the need for multiple forward
passes during inference. This proposed algorithm is named Forward-Forward
Algorithm Unified with Similarity-based Tuplet loss (FAUST). Empirical
evaluations on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets indicate that FAUST
substantially improves accuracy, narrowing the gap with backpropagation. On
CIFAR-10, FAUST achieves 56.22\% accuracy with a simple multi-layer perceptron
architecture, approaching the backpropagation benchmark of 57.63\% accuracy.

labeling and anomaly classification. We propose a method that labels log data
without manual effort, enabling supervised training and precise evaluation of
anomaly detection. Additionally, we define a taxonomy that groups anomalies
into three categories, ensuring appropriate method selection. The second layer,
Anomaly Detection, detects behaviors deviating from the norm. We propose a
flexible Anomaly Detection method adaptable to unsupervised, weakly supervised,
and supervised training. Evaluations on public and industry datasets show
F1-scores between 0.98 and 1.0, ensuring reliable anomaly detection. The third
layer, Root Cause Analysis, identifies minimal log sets describing failures,
their origin, and event sequences. By balancing training data and identifying
key services, our Root Cause Analysis method consistently detects 90-98% of
root cause log lines within the top 10 candidates, providing actionable
insights for mitigation. Our research addresses how log analysis methods can be
designed and optimized to help DevOps resolve failures efficiently. By
integrating these three layers, the architecture equips teams with robust
methods to enhance IT system reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESM虽然是临床金标准但具有侵入性和耗时性，需要开发非侵入性替代方法来安全识别语言关键脑区

Method: 分析16名参与者的颅内ECoG数据，整合神经活动信号、解剖区域标签和功能连接特征，使用RBF核SVM和MLP聚合进行电极分类

Result: 最佳模型在保留参与者上达到ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57的强准确度，区域和连接特征组合性能最佳

Conclusion: 结合空间和网络信息与非线形建模能显著改善术前功能映射，为ESM提供有前景的替代方案

Abstract: Identifying cortical regions critical for speech is essential for safe brain
surgery in or near language areas. While Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM)
remains the clinical gold standard, it is invasive and time-consuming. To
address this, we analyzed intracranial electrocorticographic (ECoG) data from
16 participants performing speech tasks and developed machine learning models
to directly predict if the brain region underneath each ECoG electrode is
critical. Ground truth labels indicating speech arrest were derived
independently from Electrical Stimulation Mapping (ESM) and used to train
classification models. Our framework integrates neural activity signals,
anatomical region labels, and functional connectivity features to capture both
local activity and network-level dynamics. We found that models combining
region and connectivity features matched the performance of the full feature
set, and outperformed models using either type alone. To classify each
electrode, trial-level predictions were aggregated using an MLP applied to
histogram-encoded scores. Our best-performing model, a trial-level RBF-kernel
Support Vector Machine together with MLP-based aggregation, achieved strong
accuracy on held-out participants (ROC-AUC: 0.87, PR-AUC: 0.57). These findings
highlight the value of combining spatial and network information with
non-linear modeling to improve functional mapping in presurgical evaluation.

*Shun Takagi,Satoshi Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的服务器扩展方案，通过使用短暂性可信执行环境（TEE）模块来实现恶意安全性的差分隐私随机化颇导者（DP-FTRL），解决了现有方案在客户端失连或被突破时的状态管理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DP-FTRL方法假设服务器是半诚实的，没有考虑在客户端可能失连或被突破的实际场景下如何安全地移除这个假设。直接使用TEE可能导致分叉攻击或可用性问题。

Method: 设计了一种服务器扩展，作为可信计算基础（TCB），通过服务端短暂性TEE模块生成服务器操作的可验证证明。选中的部分客户端参与审计这些证明，仅需小量额外通信和计算开销。

Result: 该方案在缩小TCB规模的同时保持了系统的可扩展性和活性。形式化证明显示在恶意环境下依然保持隐私保证。实验结果显示在多个实际场景下对客户端仅添加小量常数开销。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了差分隐私聚合学习中的状态管理问题，通过创新的TEE基于审计机制实现了恶意安全性的DP-FTRL，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In cross-device private federated learning, differentially private
follow-the-regularized-leader (DP-FTRL) has emerged as a promising
privacy-preserving method. However, existing approaches assume a semi-honest
server and have not addressed the challenge of securely removing this
assumption. This is due to its statefulness, which becomes particularly
problematic in practical settings where clients can drop out or be corrupted.
While trusted execution environments (TEEs) might seem like an obvious
solution, a straightforward implementation can introduce forking attacks or
availability issues due to state management. To address this problem, our paper
introduces a novel server extension that acts as a trusted computing base (TCB)
to realize maliciously secure DP-FTRL. The TCB is implemented with an ephemeral
TEE module on the server side to produce verifiable proofs of server actions.
Some clients, upon being selected, participate in auditing these proofs with
small additional communication and computational demands. This extension
solution reduces the size of the TCB while maintaining the system's scalability
and liveness. We provide formal proofs based on interactive differential
privacy, demonstrating privacy guarantee in malicious settings. Finally, we
experimentally show that our framework adds small constant overhead to clients
in several realistic settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着卷积神经网络复杂度和规模的不断增加，在边缘设备上部署大型模型面临挑战，需要通过模型压缩技术来降低模型规模和复杂度。

Method: 受EfficientNet启发，提出了一种混合剪枝框架，同时结合通道剪枝和层剪枝两种方法，通过缩小网络规模来实现模型压缩。

Result: 实验结果显示，该混合方法能够显著降低模型的总体复杂度，而准确性与基准模型相比仅有最小降低。在NVIDIA JETSON TX2嵌入式AI设备上部署时，这种复杂度降低转化为了更低的延迟。

Conclusion: 混合剪枝框架提供了一种有效的模型压缩方案，在准确性保持和复杂度降低之间取得了良好平衡，适合在资源受限的边缘设备上部署深度学习模型。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant breakthroughs
in various fields. However, these advancements have led to a substantial
increase in the complexity and size of these networks. This poses a challenge
when deploying large and complex networks on edge devices. Consequently, model
compression has emerged as a research field aimed at reducing the size and
complexity of CNNs. One prominent technique in model compression is model
pruning. This paper will present a new technique of pruning that combines both
channel and layer pruning in what is called a "hybrid pruning framework".
Inspired by EfficientNet, a renowned CNN architecture known for scaling up
networks from both channel and layer perspectives, this hybrid approach applies
the same principles but in reverse, where it scales down the network through
pruning. Experiments on the hybrid approach demonstrated a notable decrease in
the overall complexity of the model, with only a minimal reduction in accuracy
compared to the baseline model. This complexity reduction translates into
reduced latency when deploying the pruned models on an NVIDIA JETSON TX2
embedded AI device.

TL;DR: 通过温度模型生成未知随机微分方程的样本路径，无需显式指定漫洒和扩散系数，在金融投资策略中显示了良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Monte Carlo方法需要显式指定SDE的漫洒和扩散系数，而实际应用中这些参数常常未知。需要一种数据驱动的方法来生成未知SDE的样本路径。

Method: 使用条件温度模型，基于有限的SDE样本路径数据集，生成新的合成路径。这是一种模型免费、数据驱动的方法。

Result: 通过模拟实验与神经SDE等基准方法进行比较，证明了方法的有效性。在连续时间均值-方差投资组合选择问题中，使用合成样本路径显著提升了强化学习算法的性能。

Conclusion: 温度模型在金融分析和决策中具有广阔的应用前景，能够通过数据驱动的方式生成未知SDE的样本路径，为金融应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.

Conclusion: 通过利用分子模拟的连续性特性，深度平衡模型为机器学习力场提供了新的优化方向，在准确性和计算效率方面都取得了显著改进

Abstract: Machine learning force fields show great promise in enabling more accurate
molecular dynamics simulations compared to manually derived ones. Much of the
progress in recent years was driven by exploiting prior knowledge about
physical systems, in particular symmetries under rotation, translation, and
reflections. In this paper, we argue that there is another important piece of
prior information that, thus fa,r hasn't been explored: Simulating a molecular
system is necessarily continuous, and successive states are therefore extremely
similar. Our contribution is to show that we can exploit this information by
recasting a state-of-the-art equivariant base model as a deep equilibrium
model. This allows us to recycle intermediate neural network features from
previous time steps, enabling us to improve both accuracy and speed by
$10\%-20\%$ on the MD17, MD22, and OC20 200k datasets, compared to the non-DEQ
base model. The training is also much more memory efficient, allowing us to
train more expressive models on larger systems.

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) in chemistry is often hindered
by sparse experimental data and complex reaction mechanisms. To overcome these
limitations, we introduce ChemBOMAS, a new framework named LLM-Enhanced
Multi-Agent System for accelerating BO in chemistry. ChemBOMAS's optimization
process is enhanced by LLMs and synergistically employs two strategies:
knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization and data-driven fine-grained
optimization. First, in the knowledge-driven coarse-grained optimization stage,
LLMs intelligently decompose the vast search space by reasoning over existing
chemical knowledge to identify promising candidate regions. Subsequently, in
the data-driven fine-grained optimization stage, LLMs enhance the BO process
within these candidate regions by generating pseudo-data points, thereby
improving data utilization efficiency and accelerating convergence. Benchmark
evaluations** further confirm that ChemBOMAS significantly enhances
optimization effectiveness and efficiency compared to various BO algorithms.
Importantly, the practical utility of ChemBOMAS was validated through wet-lab
experiments conducted under pharmaceutical industry protocols, targeting
conditional optimization for a previously unreported and challenging chemical
reaction. In the wet experiment, ChemBOMAS achieved an optimal objective value
of 96%. This was substantially higher than the 15% achieved by domain experts.
This real-world success, together with strong performance on benchmark
evaluations, highlights ChemBOMAS as a powerful tool to accelerate chemical
discovery.

Abstract: Federating heterogeneous models on edge devices with diverse resource
constraints has been a notable trend in recent years. Compared to traditional
federated learning (FL) that assumes an identical model architecture to
cooperate, model-heterogeneous FL is more practical and flexible since the
model can be customized to satisfy the deployment requirement. Unfortunately,
no prior work ever dives into the existing model-heterogeneous FL algorithms
under the practical edge device constraints and provides quantitative analysis
on various data scenarios and metrics, which motivates us to rethink and
re-evaluate this paradigm. In our work, we construct the first system platform
\textbf{PracMHBench} to evaluate model-heterogeneous FL on practical
constraints of edge devices, where diverse model heterogeneity algorithms are
classified and tested on multiple data tasks and metrics. Based on the
platform, we perform extensive experiments on these algorithms under the
different edge constraints to observe their applicability and the corresponding
heterogeneity pattern.

Abstract: Developing autonomous LLM agents capable of making a series of intelligent
decisions to solve complex, real-world tasks is a fast-evolving frontier. Like
human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and
skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite
advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement
learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch --
without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic
environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to
train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. The
framework features a modular and decoupled architecture, ensuring high
flexibility and extensibility. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world
scenarios, and supports mainstream RL algorithms. Furthermore, we propose
ScalingInter-RL, a training approach designed for exploration-exploitation
balance and stable RL optimization. In early stages, it emphasizes exploitation
by restricting the number of interactions, and gradually shifts towards
exploration with larger horizons to encourage diverse problem-solving
strategies. In this way, the agent develops more diverse behaviors and is less
prone to collapse under long horizons. We perform extensive experiments to
validate the stability and effectiveness of both the AgentGym-RL framework and
the ScalingInter-RL approach. Our agents match or surpass commercial models on
27 tasks across diverse environments. We offer key insights and will
open-source the complete AgentGym-RL framework -- including code and datasets
-- to empower the research community in developing the next generation of
intelligent agents.

Motivation: 设计一种能够表示完整可分离傅里叶基的神经网络架构，解决传统傅里叶启发的NN模型无法在多维空间中表示完整基函数的问题

Method: 采用前馈结构配合余弦激活函数，将频率、振幅和相移作为可训练参数，建立傅里叶系数与振幅/相移之间的一一对应关系

Result: 在偏微分方程和最优控制问题等科学计算任务中，FLM性能与SIREN和传统前馈神经网络相当甚至更优

Conclusion: FLM是第一个能够在多维空间中使用标准MLP架构表示完整可分离傅里叶基的神经网络，为科学计算提供了有效的谱基表示方法

Abstract: We introduce the Fourier Learning Machine (FLM), a neural network (NN)
architecture designed to represent a multidimensional nonharmonic Fourier
series. The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation
functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series
as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a
problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic
functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first
architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple
dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture. A
one-to-one correspondence between the Fourier coefficients and amplitudes and
phase-shifts is demonstrated, allowing for the translation between a full,
separable basis form and the cosine phase--shifted one. Additionally, we
evaluate the performance of FLMs on several scientific computing problems,
including benchmark Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and a family of
Optimal Control Problems (OCPs). Computational experiments show that the
performance of FLMs is comparable, and often superior, to that of established
architectures like SIREN and vanilla feedforward NNs.

Abstract: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common brain disorder in
children that can persist into adulthood, affecting social, academic, and
career life. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing these impacts on patients
and the healthcare system but is often labor-intensive and time-consuming. This
paper presents a novel method to improve ADHD diagnosis precision and
timeliness by leveraging Deep Learning (DL) approaches and electroencephalogram
(EEG) signals. We introduce ADHDeepNet, a DL model that utilizes comprehensive
temporal-spatial characterization, attention modules, and explainability
techniques optimized for EEG signals. ADHDeepNet integrates feature extraction
and refinement processes to enhance ADHD diagnosis. The model was trained and
validated on a dataset of 121 participants (61 ADHD, 60 Healthy Controls),
employing nested cross-validation for robust performance. The proposed
two-stage methodology uses a 10-fold cross-subject validation strategy.
Initially, each iteration optimizes the model's hyper-parameters with inner
2-fold cross-validation. Then, Additive Gaussian Noise (AGN) with various
standard deviations and magnification levels is applied for data augmentation.
ADHDeepNet achieved 100% sensitivity and 99.17% accuracy in classifying ADHD/HC
subjects. To clarify model explainability and identify key brain regions and
frequency bands for ADHD diagnosis, we analyzed the learned weights and
activation patterns of the model's primary layers. Additionally, t-distributed
Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) visualized high-dimensional data, aiding
in interpreting the model's decisions. This study highlights the potential of
DL and EEG in enhancing ADHD diagnosis accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 传统推理蒸馏方法假设存在单一最优教师，但实际中往往有多个候选教师和CoT语料库可用。研究发现不同学生有不同的"最佳教师"，甚至同一学生在不同数据集上的最佳教师也不同。

Method: 提出Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT)框架，交替进行教师特定的监督微调分支和权重空间合并，以统一多个教师的推理能力并克服监督冲突。

Result: 在数学竞赛基准上，仅使用约200个高质量CoT样本，MoT使Qwen3-14B学生模型超越了DEEPSEEK-R1、QWEN3-30B-A3B等多个强大模型，性能显著提升。同时持续优于最佳单教师蒸馏和朴素多教师联合方法。

Conclusion: MoT提供了一种简单、可扩展的途径，能够高效地从多样化教师中蒸馏长链思维能力到紧凑的学生模型中，减少灾难性遗忘，提升泛化推理能力，甚至培养出更好的教师。

Abstract: Efficient reasoning distillation for long chain-of-thought (CoT) models is
increasingly constrained by the assumption of a single oracle teacher, despite
practical availability of multiple candidate teachers and growing CoT corpora.
We revisit teacher selection and observe that different students have different
"best teachers," and even for the same student the best teacher can vary across
datasets. Therefore, to unify multiple teachers' reasoning abilities into
student with overcoming conflicts among various teachers' supervision, we
propose Merge-of-Thought Distillation (MoT), a lightweight framework that
alternates between teacher-specific supervised fine-tuning branches and
weight-space merging of the resulting student variants. On competition math
benchmarks, using only about 200 high-quality CoT samples, applying MoT to a
Qwen3-14B student surpasses strong models including DEEPSEEK-R1, QWEN3-30B-A3B,
QWEN3-32B, and OPENAI-O1, demonstrating substantial gains. Besides, MoT
consistently outperforms the best single-teacher distillation and the naive
multi-teacher union, raises the performance ceiling while mitigating
overfitting, and shows robustness to distribution-shifted and peer-level
teachers. Moreover, MoT reduces catastrophic forgetting, improves general
reasoning beyond mathematics and even cultivates a better teacher, indicating
that consensus-filtered reasoning features transfer broadly. These results
position MoT as a simple, scalable route to efficiently distilling long CoT
capabilities from diverse teachers into compact students.

Abstract: Honey bee colonies are essential for global food security and ecosystem
stability, yet they face escalating threats from pests, diseases, and
environmental stressors. Traditional hive inspections are labor-intensive and
disruptive, while cloud-based monitoring solutions remain impractical for
remote or resource-limited apiaries. Recent advances in Internet of Things
(IoT) and Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) enable low-power, real-time monitoring
directly on edge devices, offering scalable and non-invasive alternatives. This
survey synthesizes current innovations at the intersection of TinyML and
apiculture, organized around four key functional areas: monitoring hive
conditions, recognizing bee behaviors, detecting pests and diseases, and
forecasting swarming events. We further examine supporting resources, including
publicly available datasets, lightweight model architectures optimized for
embedded deployment, and benchmarking strategies tailored to field constraints.
Critical limitations such as data scarcity, generalization challenges, and
deployment barriers in off-grid environments are highlighted, alongside
emerging opportunities in ultra-efficient inference pipelines, adaptive edge
learning, and dataset standardization. By consolidating research and
engineering practices, this work provides a foundation for scalable, AI-driven,
and ecologically informed monitoring systems to support sustainable pollinator

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于随机最短路径的准入控制方法，用于在分布式数据中心链路中同时处理弹性流量（如定时同步服务）和非弹性流量（如实时流媒体服务），通过状态空间离散化和动作空间优化来实现带宽资源的智能分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分布式数据中心链路中弹性流量（有截止时间要求）和非弹性流量（有收益要求）的混合带宽分配问题，需要在不确定的带宽可用性和流量负载条件下进行智能准入控制。

Method: 将准入控制建模为随机最短路径问题，状态空间基于弹性流的大小/截止时间离散化，动作空间对应不同的非弹性流准入子集，考虑带宽可用性和流量负载的不确定性。

Result: 该方法能够(i)平衡瞬时非弹性收益积累与错过弹性截止时间的风险，(ii)通过选择期望的最小弹性速率来调整对链路和流量建模错误的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的随机最短路径框架为混合流量场景提供了有效的准入控制解决方案，具有可调节的鲁棒性和对紧急或不可中断非弹性流量的适应性。

Abstract: Consider a (logical) link between two distributed data centers with available
bandwidth designated for both deadline-driven elastic traffic, such as for
scheduled synchronization services, and profitable inelastic traffic, such as
for real-time streaming services. Admission control in this setting is cast as
a stochastic shortest path problem, with state space derived from
(discretization of) the elastic flow's size/deadline and action space
corresponding to alternative subsets of admitted inelastic flows: the
probabilistic model expresses uncertainty in both the link's available
bandwidth and the inelastic flows' offered loads, while the objective function
captures both congestion avoidance and the option to specify a desired minimum
elastic rate. Its solution is shown to (i) balance the accumulation of
instantaneous inelastic reward with the risk of missing the elastic deadline
and (ii) exhibit a degree of robustness to link & flow modeling errors that is
tunable via choice of the desired minimum elastic rate. Also discussed are
state augmentations that befit urgent or non-interruptible inelastic traffic.

Motivation: 借鉴电信网络向包交换转变的成功经验，解决传统同步电网的局限性，构建更灵活、弹性的数字化能源分配系统。

Method: 采用三层架构：1）能源路由器实现电气隔离和软件控制能量流；2）基于DC微电网的本地和广域能源网络；3）由EROS操作系统和EP服务器组成的控制平面，通过ENMS进行运营商级管理。

Result: 早期市政示范项目验证了可行性和迁移路径，展示了本地自主与全球互操作性、实时操作、消除EV充电瓶颈等优势。

Conclusion: 提供了一个连贯、开放、可测试的软件定义分散式能源分配蓝图，将电力系统工程与网络原则结合，为从传统同步电网向弹性数字化能源路由系统转型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: In developing EnergyNet we have leveraged and are extending lessons from
telecom's shift from a centralized, circuit-switched phone system to
decentralized, packet-switched data networks. EnergyNet utilizes 1) an Energy
Router that enforces galvanic separation and utilizes software-controlled
energy flows over a DC backplane, 2) Energy Local and Wide Area Networks
(ELAN/EWAN) based on DC microgrids that interconnect through an open Energy
Protocol (EP), and 3) a control plane comprised of the Energy Router Operating
System (EROS) and EP Server which is managed at operator scale through an
Energy Network Management System (ENMS). We distinguish the architectural
contribution (Tier-1 including components, interfaces, and operating model)
from expected outcomes contingent on adoption (Tier-2). The latter includes
local-first autonomy with global interoperability, near-real-time operation
with local buffering, removal of EV-charging bottlenecks, freed grid capacity
for data centers and industrial electrification, as well as a trend toward low,
predictable, fixed-cost clean energy. Evidence from early municipal
demonstrators illustrates feasibility and migration paths. The contribution is
a coherent, open, and testable blueprint for software-defined, decentralized
energy distribution, aligning power-systems engineering with networking
principles and offering a practical route from legacy, synchronous grids to
resilient, digitally routed energy distribution systems.

Abstract: Regulators and utilities have been exploring hourly retail electricity
pricing, with several existing programs providing day-ahead hourly pricing
schedules. At the same time, customers are deploying distributed energy
resources and smart energy management systems that have significant flexibility
and can optimally follow price signals. In aggregate, these optimally
controlled loads can create congestion management issues for distribution
system operators (DSOs). In this paper, we describe a new linear pricing
mechanism for day-ahead retail electricity pricing that provides a signal for
customers to follow to mitigate over-consumption while still consuming energy
at hours that are preferential for system performance. We show that by
broadcasting a linear price designed for price-signal control of
cost-optimizing loads, we can shape customer load profiles to provide
congestion management without the need for bi-directional communication or
customer bidding programs.

parameters.

Abstract: The increasing reliance on cyber physical infrastructure in modern power
systems has amplified the risk of targeted cyber attacks, necessitating robust
and adaptive resilience strategies. This paper presents a mathematically
rigorous game theoretic framework to evaluate and enhance microgrid resilience
using a combination of quantitative resilience metrics Load Served Ratio LSR,
Critical Load Resilience CLR, Topological Survivability Score TSS, and DER
Resilience Score DRS. These are integrated into a unified payoff matrix using
the Analytic Hierarchy Process AHP to assess attack defense interactions. The
framework is formalized as a finite horizon Markov Decision Process MDP with
formal convergence guarantees and computational complexity bounds. Three case
studies are developed 1. static attacks analyzed via Nash equilibrium, 2.
severe attacks incorporating high impact strategies, and 3. adaptive attacks
using Stackelberg games, regret matching, softmax heuristics, and Multi Agent Q
Learning. Rigorous theoretical analysis provides convergence proofs with
explicit rates , PAC learning sample complexity bounds, and computational
complexity analysis. The framework is tested on an enhanced IEEE 33bus

effectiveness of adaptive and strategic defenses in improving cyber physical
resilience with statistically significant improvements of 18.7% 2.1% over

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了抽象验证中的信息保留问题，为连续时间系统在复杂规范下的验证提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: A key challenge in abstraction-based verification and control under complex
specifications such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) is that abstract models
retain significantly less information than their original systems. This issue
is especially true for continuous-time systems, where the system state
trajectories are split into intervals of discrete actions, and satisfaction of
atomic propositions is abstracted to a whole time interval. To tackle this
challenge, this work introduces a novel translation from LTL specifications to
AP-observation automata, a particular type of B\"uchi automata specifically
designed for abstraction-based verification. Based on this automaton, we
present a game-based verification algorithm played between the system and the
environment, and an illustrative example for abstraction-based system
verification under several LTL specifications.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of collective circular motion control for
unicycle agents, with the objective of achieving phase coordination of their
velocity vectors while ensuring that their trajectories remain confined within
a prescribed non-concentric circular boundary. To accommodate such nonuniform
motion constraints, we build upon our earlier work and extend the use of Mobius
transformation to a multi-agent framework. The Mobius transformation maps two
nonconcentric circles to concentric ones, thereby converting spatially
nonuniform constraints into uniform ones in the transformed plane. Leveraging
this property, we introduce the notion of a phase-shifted order parameter,
along with the associated concepts of Mobius phase-shift coupled
synchronization and balancing, which characterize the phase-coordinated
patterns studied in this paper. We establish an equivalence between the
unicycle dynamics in the original and transformed planes under the Mobius
transformation and its inverse, and show that synchronization is preserved
across both planes, whereas balancing is generally not. Distributed control
laws are then designed in the transformed plane using barrier Lyapunov
functions, under the assumption of an undirected and connected communication
topology among agents. These controllers are subsequently mapped back to the
original plane to obtain the linear acceleration and turn-rate control inputs
applied to the actual agents. Both simulations and experimental results are
provided to illustrate the proposed framework.

Abstract: Achieving net-zero targets requires the phase-out of fossil-based heating. A
major challenge is the seasonal mismatch between renewable heat supply and
demand. District heating networks often dispose of excess heat in summer and
rely on fossil backups in winter. Large-scale thermal energy storage offers a
solution by storing surplus summer heat for use during winter, thus reducing
the need for fossil fuels. This study investigates the feasibility of a
large-scale thermal storage system at a power production site that supplies a
large district heating network in the city of Bern, Switzerland. Specifically,
the study examines the potential of a geothermal storage system to offset
fossil fuel heat generation in winter by utilising heat stored during the
summer months. Using a Python-based multi-energy system model, we simulate the
optimal operation of the geothermal storage system with respect to cost and
emissions, considering both supply and demand on an hourly basis over one year.
Multi-objective optimisation is applied to generate a Pareto-optimal front. The
results show that the geothermal storage system eliminates the requirement of 8
GWh of gas-powered heat supply and increases the waste heat utilisation by 20%,
therefore lowering emissions. This effect is further increased when combined
with an expansion of the district heating network, as individual,
emission-heavy heaters are replaced by low-emission heat from the district
heating network. The findings presented in this study can prove useful when
evaluating similar systems across Switzerland.

Abstract: This study investigates the mitigation of acoustic emissions from tidal
current converters (TCCs) through optimized control strategies to enhance power
generation efficiency while minimizing environmental impacts on marine life. A
MATLAB/Simulink-based model of a Tidal Current Conversion System (TCCS) was
developed to simulate the effects of variable control parameters, including
switching frequencies, maximum power point tracking (MPPT) coefficients, and
the elimination of the gearbox, on underwater noise levels. Acoustic emissions
were quantified in terms of sound pressure levels (SPLs), and their potential
impacts on marine mammals and fish were evaluated against species-specific
auditory thresholds for temporary and permanent hearing threshold shifts. The
results indicate that adjusting control parameters can significantly reduce
SPLs, with the removal of the gearbox yielding the greatest noise reduction.
The study identifies operational conditions under which marine species are at
risk of auditory damage and proposes control strategies to mitigate these risks
without compromising energy output. These findings contribute to the
understanding of how control system modifications can balance the efficiency of
marine energy systems with ecological considerations, offering guidance for the
design and operation of environmentally compliant TCCs.

Conclusion: UGCN能够泛化到完全未见过的系统重构，包括网络重组和重大电网扩展，适用于输配电网络

Abstract: This work addresses a fundamental challenge in applying deep learning to
power systems: developing neural network models that transfer across
significant system changes, including networks with entirely different
topologies and dimensionalities, without requiring training data from unseen
reconfigurations. Despite extensive research, most ML-based approaches remain
system-specific, limiting real-world deployment. This limitation stems from a
dual barrier. First, topology changes shift feature distributions and alter
input dimensions due to power flow physics. Second, reconfigurations redefine
output semantics and dimensionality, requiring models to handle
configuration-specific outputs while maintaining transferable feature
extraction. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Universal Graph
Convolutional Network (UGCN) that achieves transferability to any
reconfiguration or variation of existing power systems without any prior
knowledge of new grid topologies or retraining during implementation. Our
approach applies to both transmission and distribution networks and
demonstrates generalization capability to completely unseen system
reconfigurations, such as network restructuring and major grid expansions.
Experimental results across power system applications, including false data
injection detection and state forecasting, show that UGCN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-system zero-shot transferability
of new reconfigurations.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种实用高效的CSI反馈方案，在不牺牲重建精度的前提下显著降低了所需反馈比特率。

Abstract: Massive MIMO systems rely on accurate Channel State Information (CSI)
feedback to enable high-gain beam-forming. However, the feedback overhead
scales linearly with the number of antennas, presenting a major bottleneck.
While recent deep learning methods have improved CSI compression, most overlook
the impact of quantization and entropy coding, limiting their practical
deployability. In this work, we propose an end-to-end CSI compression framework
that integrates a Spatial Correlation-Guided Attention Mechanism with
quantization and entropy-aware training. Our model effectively exploits the
spatial correlation among the antennas, thereby learning compact,
entropy-optimized latent representations for efficient coding. This reduces the
required feedback bitrates without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy, thereby
yielding a superior rate-distortion trade-off. Experiments show that our method
surpasses existing end-to-end CSI compression schemes, exceeding benchmark
performance by an average of 21.5% on indoor datasets and 18.9% on outdoor
datasets. The proposed framework results in a practical and efficient CSI
feedback scheme.

Abstract: Designing observers for linear systems with both known and unknown inputs is
an important problem in several research contexts, for example, fault diagnosis
and fault-tolerant control, and cyber-secure control systems, and presents
significant challenges in distributed state estimation due to the limited
sensing capabilities of individual nodes. Existing methods typically impose an
individual input-to-output rank condition on each estimator node, which
severely restricts applicability in practical applications. This paper presents
a novel distributed unknown-input observer design scheme based on a geometric
approach under much weaker assumptions than the ones available in the
literature. By leveraging the properties of the $(C, A)$-invariant (conditioned
invariant) subspace at each node, our methodology aims at reconstructing
portions of the system state that remain unaffected by local unknown inputs,
while integrating these estimates via a network-based information exchange. A
case study on vehicle platoon control shows the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.

TL;DR: RB-CBS是一种多智能体路径规划方法，通过动态分配风险预算来平衡安全性和效率，解决了传统图剪枝方法过于保守的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划方法依赖预定义距离度量，而安全强化学习在多智能体目标条件场景中表现不佳。现有的图剪枝方法过于保守，限制了任务效率，特别是在需要穿越高风险区域的任务中。

Method: 提出RB-CBS方法，扩展了冲突搜索算法(CBS)，动态分配和调整用户指定的风险边界(Δ)给各个智能体，为每个智能体分配局部风险预算(δ)，实现安全性和速度的灵活权衡。

Result: 实验结果表明，这种迭代风险分配框架在复杂环境中表现出优越性能，使多个智能体能够在用户指定的风险边界内找到无碰撞路径。

Conclusion: RB-CBS通过动态风险预算分配，有效解决了多智能体视觉导航中安全性与效率的平衡问题，相比传统方法具有更好的性能。

Abstract: Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous
environments, especially when multiple agents must coordinate using just visual
inputs over extended time horizons. Traditional planning methods excel at
solving long-horizon tasks but rely on predefined distance metrics, while safe
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors using high-dimensional
inputs yet struggles with multi-agent, goal-conditioned scenarios. Recent work
combined these paradigms by leveraging goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) to build an
intermediate graph from replay buffer states, pruning unsafe edges, and using
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) for multi-agent path planning. Although effective,
this graph-pruning approach can be overly conservative, limiting mission
efficiency by precluding missions that must traverse high-risk regions. To
address this limitation, we propose RB-CBS, a novel extension to CBS that
dynamically allocates and adjusts user-specified risk bound ($\Delta$) across
agents to flexibly trade off safety and speed. Our improved planner ensures
that each agent receives a local risk budget ($\delta$) enabling more efficient
navigation while still respecting overall safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that this iterative risk-allocation framework yields
superior performance in complex environments, allowing multiple agents to find
collision-free paths within the user-specified $\Delta$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多臂运动规划方法面临状态空间指数增长和学习模型依赖大规模数据的问题，需要更高效可扩展的解决方案

Method: 结合MAPF分解思想，训练两个条件扩散模型：一个生成单臂可行轨迹，另一个建模双臂碰撞解决动态，通过结构化分解实现扩展

Result: 在不同团队规模下相比其他学习方法表现出有效性和实际应用价值

Conclusion: DG-MAP方法成功提升了学习模型的可扩展性，同时降低了对大规模多臂数据集的需求，为复杂长时域任务提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Multi-arm motion planning is fundamental for enabling arms to complete
complex long-horizon tasks in shared spaces efficiently but current methods
struggle with scalability due to exponential state-space growth and reliance on
large training datasets for learned models. Inspired by Multi-Agent Path
Finding (MAPF), which decomposes planning into single-agent problems coupled
with collision resolution, we propose a novel diffusion-guided multi-arm
planner (DG-MAP) that enhances scalability of learning-based models while
reducing their reliance on massive multi-arm datasets. Recognizing that
collisions are primarily pairwise, we train two conditional diffusion models,
one to generate feasible single-arm trajectories, and a second, to model the
dual-arm dynamics required for effective pairwise collision resolution. By
integrating these specialized generative models within a MAPF-inspired
structured decomposition, our planner efficiently scales to larger number of
arms. Evaluations against alternative learning-based methods across various
team sizes demonstrate our method's effectiveness and practical applicability.

Abstract: PySensors is a Python package for selecting and placing a sparse set of
sensors for reconstruction and classification tasks. In this major update to
\texttt{PySensors}, we introduce spatially constrained sensor placement
capabilities, allowing users to enforce constraints such as maximum or exact
sensor counts in specific regions, incorporate predetermined sensor locations,
and maintain minimum distances between sensors. We extend functionality to
support custom basis inputs, enabling integration of any data-driven or
spectral basis. We also propose a thermodynamic approach that goes beyond a
single ``optimal'' sensor configuration and maps the complete landscape of
sensor interactions induced by the training data. This comprehensive view
facilitates integration with external selection criteria and enables assessment
of sensor replacement impacts. The new optimization technique also accounts for
over- and under-sampling of sensors, utilizing a regularized least squares
approach for robust reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate noise-induced
uncertainty quantification of the estimation error and provide visual
uncertainty heat maps to guide deployment decisions. To highlight these
additions, we provide a brief description of the mathematical algorithms and
theory underlying these new capabilities. We demonstrate the usage of new
features with illustrative code examples and include practical advice for
implementation across various application domains. Finally, we outline a
roadmap of potential extensions to further enhance the package's functionality
and applicability to emerging sensing challenges.

Abstract: This letter introduces SVN-ICP, a novel Iterative Closest Point (ICP)
algorithm with uncertainty estimation that leverages Stein Variational Newton
(SVN) on manifold. Designed specifically for fusing LiDAR odometry in

consistent noise parameter inference, even in LiDAR-degraded environments. By
approximating the posterior distribution using particles within the Stein
Variational Inference framework, SVN-ICP eliminates the need for explicit noise

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is a critical component of the navigation stack required
for mobile robots to operate effectively in complex and unknown environments.
In this research, three end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were
trained and evaluated offline and deployed on a differential-drive mobile robot
for real-time obstacle avoidance to generate low-level steering commands from
synchronized color and depth images acquired by an Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D
camera in diverse environments. Offline evaluation showed that the NetConEmb
model achieved the best performance with a notably low MedAE of $0.58 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s. In comparison, the lighter NetEmb architecture adopted in this
study, which reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 25\%
and converges faster, produced comparable results with an RMSE of $21.68 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s, close to the $21.42 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s obtained by
NetConEmb. Real-time navigation further confirmed NetConEmb's robustness,

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for multi-robot systems to perform
simultaneous learning and coverage of the domain of interest characterized by
an unknown and potentially time-varying density function. To overcome the
limitations of Gaussian Process (GP) regression, we employ Random Feature GP
(RFGP) and its online variant (O-RFGP) that enables online and incremental
inference. By integrating these with Voronoi-based coverage control and Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy, a team of robots can adaptively focus
on important regions while refining the learned spatial field for efficient
coverage. Under mild assumptions, we provide theoretical guarantees and
evaluate the framework through simulations in time-invariant scenarios.
Furthermore, its effectiveness in time-varying settings is demonstrated through
additional simulations and a physical experiment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理开放形式的语言表达，通常假设目标物体无歧义且无重复实例，且依赖昂贵的像素级标注。需要开发能够处理复杂语言指令和重复物体的高效抓取系统。

Method: 提出基于属性的物体定位和机器人抓取框架(OGRG)，包含双向视觉语言融合模块和深度信息集成，支持全监督和弱监督两种学习设置。

Result: 在桌面场景中优于所有基线方法，RGS模式下在RTX 2080 Ti上达到17.59 FPS，RGA模式下在仿真和真实机器人试验中都取得了更高的抓取成功率。

Conclusion: OGRG框架通过有效的空间推理设计，显著提升了机器人基于自然语言指令的物体定位和抓取能力，特别是在处理重复物体和弱监督学习方面表现出色。

Abstract: Enabling robots to grasp objects specified through natural language is
essential for effective human-robot interaction, yet it remains a significant
challenge. Existing approaches often struggle with open-form language
expressions and typically assume unambiguous target objects without duplicates.
Moreover, they frequently rely on costly, dense pixel-wise annotations for both
object grounding and grasp configuration. We present Attribute-based Object
Grounding and Robotic Grasping (OGRG), a novel framework that interprets
open-form language expressions and performs spatial reasoning to ground target
objects and predict planar grasp poses, even in scenes containing duplicated
object instances. We investigate OGRG in two settings: (1) Referring Grasp
Synthesis (RGS) under pixel-wise full supervision, and (2) Referring Grasp
Affordance (RGA) using weakly supervised learning with only single-pixel grasp
annotations. Key contributions include a bi-directional vision-language fusion
module and the integration of depth information to enhance geometric reasoning,
improving both grounding and grasping performance. Experiment results show that
OGRG outperforms strong baselines in tabletop scenes with diverse spatial
language instructions. In RGS, it operates at 17.59 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX
2080 Ti GPU, enabling potential use in closed-loop or multi-object sequential
grasping, while delivering superior grounding and grasp prediction accuracy
compared to all the baselines considered. Under the weakly supervised RGA
setting, OGRG also surpasses baseline grasp-success rates in both simulation
and real-robot trials, underscoring the effectiveness of its spatial reasoning
design. Project page: https://z.umn.edu/ogrg

Conclusion: IUPF框架能够有效处理异构驾驶行为，保证纳什均衡的指数收敛，为自动驾驶交互轨迹规划提供了既安全又高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Interactive trajectory planning in autonomous driving must balance safety,
efficiency, and scalability under heterogeneous driving behaviors. Existing
methods often face high computational cost or rely on external safety critics.
To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field
(IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a
physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The
approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without
additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to
guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane
changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances,
generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional
optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and
computational efficiency.

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to predict metric depth from monocular RGB
images and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). To enable collision avoidance
during autonomous flight, prior works either leverage heavy sensors (e.g.,
LiDARs or stereo cameras) or data-intensive and domain-specific fine-tuning of
monocular metric depth estimation methods. In contrast, we propose several
lightweight zero-shot rescaling strategies to obtain metric depth from relative
depth estimates via the sparse 3D feature map created using a visual-inertial
navigation system. These strategies are compared for their accuracy in diverse
simulation environments. The best performing approach, which leverages
monotonic spline fitting, is deployed in the real-world on a
compute-constrained quadrotor. We obtain on-board metric depth estimates at 15
Hz and demonstrate successful collision avoidance after integrating the
proposed method with a motion primitives-based planner.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based quadrotor navigation
method that leverages efficient differentiable simulation, novel loss
functions, and privileged information to navigate around large obstacles. Prior
learning-based methods perform well in scenes that exhibit narrow obstacles,
but struggle when the goal location is blocked by large walls or terrain. In
contrast, the proposed method utilizes time-of-arrival (ToA) maps as privileged
information and a yaw alignment loss to guide the robot around large obstacles.
The policy is evaluated in photo-realistic simulation environments containing
large obstacles, sharp corners, and dead-ends. Our approach achieves an 86%
success rate and outperforms baseline strategies by 34%. We deploy the policy
onboard a custom quadrotor in outdoor cluttered environments both during the
day and night. The policy is validated across 20 flights, covering 589 meters
without collisions at speeds up to 4 m/s.

Motivation: 自动驾驶研究日益采用深度强化学习作为数据驱动决策框架，但缺乏对这些算法如何被使用、基准测试和评估的系统性分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，为研究社区提供统一的分类和量化统计。

Method: 系统分析了约100篇同行评审论文，按算法家族（模型无关、模型相关、分层、混合）进行分类，量化其流行程度，并分析状态、动作、奖励公式的多样性设计。

Result: 发现超过80%的研究仍依赖模型无关方法（如DQN、PPO、SAC）；总结了常用的传感器模态、控制抽象和奖励塑造方法；整合了评估指标和CARLA基准测试配置。

Conclusion: 指出了稀疏奖励、仿真到现实的迁移、安全保证和行为多样性有限等持续挑战，提出了基于模型的RL、元学习和更丰富的多智能体模拟等有前景的方向，为RL自动驾驶研究提供了路线图。

Abstract: Autonomous-driving research has recently embraced deep Reinforcement Learning
(RL) as a promising framework for data-driven decision making, yet a clear
picture of how these algorithms are currently employed, benchmarked and
evaluated is still missing. This survey fills that gap by systematically
analysing around 100 peer-reviewed papers that train, test or validate RL
policies inside the open-source CARLA simulator. We first categorize the
literature by algorithmic family model-free, model-based, hierarchical, and
hybrid and quantify their prevalence, highlighting that more than 80% of
existing studies still rely on model-free methods such as DQN, PPO and SAC.
Next, we explain the diverse state, action and reward formulations adopted
across works, illustrating how choices of sensor modality (RGB, LiDAR, BEV,
semantic maps, and carla kinematics states), control abstraction (discrete vs.
continuous) and reward shaping are used across various literature. We also
consolidate the evaluation landscape by listing the most common metrics
(success rate, collision rate, lane deviation, driving score) and the towns,
scenarios and traffic configurations used in CARLA benchmarks. Persistent
challenges including sparse rewards, sim-to-real transfer, safety guarantees
and limited behaviour diversity are distilled into a set of open research
questions, and promising directions such as model-based RL, meta-learning and
richer multi-agent simulations are outlined. By providing a unified taxonomy,
quantitative statistics and a critical discussion of limitations, this review
aims to serve both as a reference for newcomers and as a roadmap for advancing
RL-based autonomous driving toward real-world deployment.

Motivation: 解决双向遥控系统复杂性高、实现困难的问题，提供一种简单易用的力反馈遥控方案

Method: 使用简单反馈控制器，无需力传感器，适用于主从架构的低成本硬件

Result: 方法参数调整最小化，操作性和接触稳定性超过传统方法，通信周期低时性能衰减最小，在两种商用低成本硬件上无需参数调整即可实现

Conclusion: 该方法将扩大力反馈遥控系统在低成本硬件上的应用，推动接触任务自主性的发展

Abstract: Effective data collection in contact-rich manipulation requires force
feedback during teleoperation, as accurate perception of contact is crucial for
stable control. However, such technology remains uncommon, largely because
bilateral teleoperation systems are complex and difficult to implement. To
overcome this, we propose a bilateral teleoperation method that relies only on
a simple feedback controller and does not require force sensors. The approach
is designed for leader-follower setups using low-cost hardware, making it
broadly applicable. Through numerical simulations and real-world experiments,
we demonstrate that the method requires minimal parameter tuning, yet achieves
both high operability and contact stability, outperforming conventional
approaches. Furthermore, we show its high robustness: even at low communication
cycle rates between leader and follower, control performance degradation is
minimal compared to high-speed operation. We also prove our method can be
implemented on two types of commercially available low-cost hardware with zero
parameter adjustments. This highlights its high ease of implementation and
versatility. We expect this method will expand the use of force feedback
teleoperation systems on low-cost hardware. This will contribute to advancing
contact-rich task autonomy in imitation learning.

Conclusion: Stereo-DEVO系统通过深度学习方法有效解决了事件基视觉量程在极端条件下的可靠性问题，为地面机器人在复杂光照环境中提供了高精度的实时位置估计能力

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired sensors with pixels that independently
and asynchronously respond to brightness changes at microsecond resolution,
offering the potential to handle state estimation tasks involving motion blur
and high dynamic range (HDR) illumination conditions. However, the versatility
of event-based visual odometry (VO) relying on handcrafted data association
(either direct or indirect methods) is still unreliable, especially in field
robot applications under low-light HDR conditions, where the dynamic range can
be enormous and the signal-to-noise ratio is spatially-and-temporally varying.
Leveraging deep neural networks offers new possibilities for overcoming these
challenges. In this paper, we propose a learning-based stereo event visual
odometry. Building upon Deep Event Visual Odometry (DEVO), our system (called
Stereo-DEVO) introduces a novel and efficient static-stereo association
strategy for sparse depth estimation with almost no additional computational
burden. By integrating it into a tightly coupled bundle adjustment (BA)
optimization scheme, and benefiting from the recurrent network's ability to
perform accurate optical flow estimation through voxel-based event
representations to establish reliable patch associations, our system achieves
high-precision pose estimation in metric scale. In contrast to the offline
performance of DEVO, our system can process event data of \zs{Video Graphics
Array} (VGA) resolution in real time. Extensive evaluations on multiple public
real-world datasets and self-collected data justify our system's versatility,
demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art event-based VO
methods. More importantly, our system achieves stable pose estimation even in
large-scale nighttime HDR scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出递归Koopman学习(RKL)方法，在数据获取和计算资源有限的情况下实现高样本效率的轻量级学习，仅需基准方法10%的数据量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法需要大数据集且难以实时更新模型，限制了在动态环境中的性能。Koopman理论可将非线性系统表示为可观测空间上的线性模型，适合快速模型更新

Method: 基于Koopman理论的递归学习管道，通过递归方式更新Koopman表示，算法复杂度与数据集大小无关

Conclusion: RKL方法在硬件学习场景中表现出优异的样本效率和实时性能，为数据驱动控制提供了轻量高效的解决方案

Abstract: Data-driven control methods need to be sample-efficient and lightweight,
especially when data acquisition and computational resources are limited --
such as during learning on hardware. Most modern data-driven methods require
large datasets and struggle with real-time updates of models, limiting their
performance in dynamic environments. Koopman theory formally represents
nonlinear systems as linear models over observables, and Koopman
representations can be determined from data in an optimization-friendly setting
with potentially rapid model updates. In this paper, we present a highly
sample-efficient, Koopman-based learning pipeline: Recursive Koopman Learning
(RKL). We identify sufficient conditions for model convergence and provide
formal algorithmic analysis supporting our claim that RKL is lightweight and
fast, with complexity independent of dataset size. We validate our method on a
simulated planar two-link arm and a hybrid nonlinear hardware system with soft
actuators, showing that real-time recursive Koopman model updates improve the
sample efficiency and stability of data-driven controller synthesis --
requiring only <10% of the data compared to benchmarks. The high-performance
C++ codebase is open-sourced. Website:

Motivation: 研究多机器人系统中行为异构性对探索效率的影响，解决传统同构团队在复杂环境探索中的局限性

Method: 使用SLAM建图识别兴趣区域，通过行为熵(BE)评估前沿效用，将任务分配转化为非合作博弈问题，采用分布式算法(d-PBRAG)收敛到纳什均衡

Conclusion: 行为异构的机器人团队在探索任务中具有优势，分布式博弈论方法能有效实现最优任务分配

Abstract: We study a problem of multi-agent exploration with behaviorally heterogeneous
robots. Each robot maps its surroundings using SLAM and identifies a set of
areas of interest (AoIs) or frontiers that are the most informative to explore
next. The robots assess the utility of going to a frontier using Behavioral
Entropy (BE) and then determine which frontier to go to via a distributed task
assignment scheme. We convert the task assignment problem into a
non-cooperative game and use a distributed algorithm (d-PBRAG) to converge to
the Nash equilibrium (which we show is the optimal task allocation solution).
For unknown utility cases, we provide robust bounds using approximate rewards.
We test our algorithm (which has less communication cost and fast convergence)
in simulation, where we explore the effect of sensing radii, sensing accuracy,
and heterogeneity among robotic teams with respect to the time taken to
complete exploration and path traveled. We observe that having a team of agents
with heterogeneous behaviors is beneficial.

Conclusion: 通过利用多自然系统的对称性特性，可以显著提高逆向强化学习的样本效率，为机器人应用提供了一种实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In robotic systems, the performance of reinforcement learning depends on the
rationality of predefined reward functions. However, manually designed reward
functions often lead to policy failures due to inaccuracies. Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) addresses this problem by inferring implicit
reward functions from expert demonstrations. Nevertheless, existing methods
rely heavily on large amounts of expert demonstrations to accurately recover
the reward function. The high cost of collecting expert demonstrations in
robotic applications, particularly in multi-robot systems, severely hinders the
practical deployment of IRL. Consequently, improving sample efficiency has
emerged as a critical challenge in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning
(MIRL). Inspired by the symmetry inherent in multi-agent systems, this work
theoretically demonstrates that leveraging symmetry enables the recovery of
more accurate reward functions. Building upon this insight, we propose a
universal framework that integrates symmetry into existing multi-agent
adversarial IRL algorithms, thereby significantly enhancing sample efficiency.
Experimental results from multiple challenging tasks have demonstrated the
effectiveness of this framework. Further validation in physical multi-robot
systems has shown the practicality of our method.

This survey examines how these models address critical challenges in autonomous
perception, including limitations in generalization, scalability, and

capability-driven guide for model development and clearer insights into
foundational aspects. We conclude by discussing key challenges, particularly
those associated with the integration of these capabilities into real-time,
scalable systems, and broader deployment challenges related to computational
demands and ensuring model reliability against issues like hallucinations and
out-of-distribution failures. The survey also outlines crucial future research
directions to enable the safe and effective deployment of foundation models in

TL;DR: FMT^x是FMT*算法的扩展，通过在动态环境中实现高效重规划来解决单次规划的限制，保持渐进最优性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中的路径规划是机器人技术的核心挑战，现有算法如FMT*在静态环境中表现良好但无法实时适应环境变化，而完全重规划计算成本过高。

Method: 修改FMT*的邻居选择规则，维护成本排序的优先级队列，应用选择性更新条件，通过扩展邻居来识别和触发潜在次优路径节点的重新评估。

Result: FMT^x在动态事件中反应更迅速，计算开销更低，性能优于有影响力的重规划器RRT^x。

Conclusion: FMT^x为不可预测世界中的实时机器人导航提供了更有效的解决方案，能够在环境变化后恢复渐进最优解。

Abstract: Path planning in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in robotics,
especially as autonomous systems are deployed in unpredictable spaces such as
warehouses and public roads. While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree
(FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their
single-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time
adaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally
expensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching
Tree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic
environments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and
demonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation,
enabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better
connections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational
efficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a
selective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and
trigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path,
FMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the
environment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency
of FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle
configuration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal
solution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that
FMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more
swiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a
more effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable
worlds.

Abstract: Visual-based localization has made significant progress, yet its performance
often drops in large-scale, outdoor, and long-term settings due to factors like
lighting changes, dynamic scenes, and low-texture areas. These challenges
degrade feature extraction and tracking, which are critical for accurate motion
estimation. While learning-based methods such as SuperPoint and SuperGlue show
improved feature coverage and robustness, they still face generalization issues
with out-of-distribution data. We address this by enhancing deep feature
extraction and tracking through self-supervised learning with task specific
feedback. Our method promotes stable and informative features, improving
generalization and reliability in challenging environments.

Abstract: Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D
maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and
difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a
novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables
zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or
pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path
planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate
towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key
limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory
using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an
auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when
necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set
applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world
tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective
solution for visual navigation in open-set environments. The source code is

Abstract: Tactile and kinesthetic perceptions are crucial for human dexterous
manipulation, enabling reliable grasping of objects via proprioceptive
sensorimotor integration. For robotic hands, even though acquiring such tactile
and kinesthetic feedback is feasible, establishing a direct mapping from this
sensory feedback to motor actions remains challenging. In this paper, we
propose a novel glove-mediated tactile-kinematic perception-prediction
framework for grasp skill transfer from human intuitive and natural operation
to robotic execution based on imitation learning, and its effectiveness is
validated through generalized grasping tasks, including those involving
deformable objects. Firstly, we integrate a data glove to capture tactile and
kinesthetic data at the joint level. The glove is adaptable for both human and
robotic hands, allowing data collection from natural human hand demonstrations
across different scenarios. It ensures consistency in the raw data format,
enabling evaluation of grasping for both human and robotic hands. Secondly, we
establish a unified representation of multi-modal inputs based on graph
structures with polar coordinates. We explicitly integrate the morphological
differences into the designed representation, enhancing the compatibility
across different demonstrators and robotic hands. Furthermore, we introduce the
Tactile-Kinesthetic Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (TK-STGN), which leverage
multidimensional subgraph convolutions and attention-based LSTM layers to
extract spatio-temporal features from graph inputs to predict node-based states
for each hand joint. These predictions are then mapped to final commands
through a force-position hybrid mapping.

Conclusion: 该方法完全绕过了对专家数据的依赖，在复杂地形运动规划中表现出卓越的有效性和效率

Abstract: Diffusion models offer powerful generative capabilities for robot trajectory
planning, yet their practical deployment on robots is hindered by a critical
bottleneck: a reliance on imitation learning from expert demonstrations. This
paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and
creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome
this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that
enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from
environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our
core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function
Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve
superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional
methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous
parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for
efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and
robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly
Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start,
significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task,
our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best
method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning.

Conclusion: VAICAM通过神经网络和速度增强的方法，有效解决了传统力控制器的局限性，实现了更好的力跟踪性能

Abstract: As robotics gains popularity, interaction control becomes crucial for
ensuring force tracking in manipulator-based tasks. Typically, traditional
interaction controllers either require extensive tuning, or demand expert
knowledge of the environment, which is often impractical in real-world
applications. This work proposes a novel control strategy leveraging Neural
Networks (NNs) to enhance the force-tracking behavior of a Direct Force
Controller (DFC). Unlike similar previous approaches, it accounts for the
manipulator's tangential velocity, a critical factor in force exertion,
especially during fast motions. The method employs an ensemble of feedforward
NNs to predict contact forces, then exploits the prediction to solve an
optimization problem and generate an optimal residual action, which is added to
the DFC output and applied to an impedance controller. The proposed
Velocity-augmented Artificial intelligence Interaction Controller for Ambiguous
Models (VAICAM) is validated in the Gazebo simulator on a Franka Emika Panda
robot. Against a vast set of trajectories, VAICAM achieves superior performance
compared to two baseline controllers.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics have enabled the widespread deployment of
autonomous robotic systems in complex operational environments, presenting both
unprecedented opportunities and significant security problems. Traditional
shepherding approaches based on fixed formations are often ineffective or risky
in urban and obstacle-rich scenarios, especially when facing adversarial agents
with unknown and adaptive behaviors. This paper addresses this challenge as an
extended herding problem, where defensive robotic systems must safely guide
adversarial agents with unknown strategies away from protected areas and into
predetermined safe regions, while maintaining collision-free navigation in
dynamic environments. We propose a hierarchical hybrid framework based on
reach-avoid game theory and local motion planning, incorporating a virtual
containment boundary and event-triggered pursuit mechanisms to enable scalable
and robust multi-agent coordination. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves safe and efficient guidance of adversarial agents to
designated regions.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our localization method called CLAP, Clustering to
Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which helped us win the RoboCup 2024
adult-sized autonomous humanoid soccer competition. Competition rules limited
our sensor suite to stereo vision and an inertial sensor, similar to humans. In
addition, our robot had to deal with varying lighting conditions, dynamic
feature occlusions, noise from high-impact stepping, and mistaken features from
bystanders and neighboring fields. Therefore, we needed an accurate, and most
importantly robust localization algorithm that would be the foundation for our
path-planning and game-strategy algorithms. CLAP achieves these requirements by
clustering estimated states of our robot from pairs of field features to
localize its global position and orientation. Correct state estimates naturally
cluster together, while incorrect estimates spread apart, making CLAP resilient
to noise and incorrect inputs. CLAP is paired with a particle filter and an
extended Kalman filter to improve consistency and smoothness. Tests of CLAP
with other landmark-based localization methods showed similar accuracy.
However, tests with increased false positive feature detection showed that CLAP
outperformed other methods in terms of robustness with very little divergence
and velocity jumps. Our localization performed well in competition, allowing
our robot to shoot faraway goals and narrowly defend our goal.

tackle long-horizon tasks in dynamic environments. Our system enhances
teleoperation performance, data collection efficiency, task accuracy, and
operational stability. The core of RoboMatch is a cockpit-style control

proprioceptive feedback, substantially boosting fine manipulation performance.
Furthermore, we propose an Auto-Matching Network (AMN) architecture that
decomposes long-horizon tasks into logical sequences and dynamically assigns
lightweight pre-trained models for distributed inference. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach improves data collection efficiency by over 20%,
increases task success rates by 20-30% with PVE-DP, and enhances long-horizon
inference performance by approximately 40% with AMN, offering a robust solution
for complex manipulation tasks.

Result: 在MNIST数据集缺失数字的模型和无人机视觉入侵检测的真实场景中验证了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该框架能够自动化地发现模型故障模式，减少对人工和领域专业知识的依赖，提高模型审计效率

Abstract: Specialized machine learning models, regardless of architecture and training,
are susceptible to failures in deployment. With their increasing use in high
risk situations, the ability to audit these models by determining their
operational design domain (ODD) is crucial in ensuring safety and compliance.
However, given the high-dimensional input spaces, this process often requires
significant human resources and domain expertise. To alleviate this, we
introduce \coolname, an LLM-Agent centric framework for automated generation of
semantically relevant test cases to search for failure modes in specialized
black-box models. By leveraging LLM-Agents as tool orchestrators, we aim to fit
a uncertainty-aware failure distribution model on a learned text-embedding
manifold by projecting the high-dimension input space to low-dimension
text-embedding latent space. The LLM-Agent is tasked with iteratively building
the failure landscape by leveraging tools for generating test-cases to probe
the model-under-test (MUT) and recording the response. The agent also guides
the search using tools to probe uncertainty estimate on the low dimensional
manifold. We demonstrate this process in a simple case using models trained
with missing digits on the MNIST dataset and in the real world setting of
vision-based intruder detection for aerial vehicles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动目标旅行商问题在存在非线性目标轨迹或智能体运动学约束时，现有算法无法保证收敛到最优解，需要新的求解框架。

Method: 提出IRG框架：交替随机采样智能体配置-时间点（对应目标拦截点）和求解广义TSP序列。开发了两种并行算法IRG-PGLNS（基于并行化GLNS求解器）和PCG（并行通信GTSP求解）。

Result: 在三种MT-TSP变体（距离拦截、变速度Dubins车、冗余机械臂）上的数值结果表明，IRG-PGLNS和PCG都比基于先前工作的基线方法收敛更快。

Conclusion: IRG框架能够实现渐近最优收敛，提出的并行算法在多个实际应用场景中表现出优越性能，为解决复杂移动目标拦截问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The Moving Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MT-TSP) seeks an agent
trajectory that intercepts several moving targets, within a particular time
window for each target. In the presence of generic nonlinear target
trajectories or kinematic constraints on the agent, no prior algorithm
guarantees convergence to an optimal MT-TSP solution. Therefore, we introduce
the Iterated Random Generalized (IRG) TSP framework. The key idea behind IRG is
to alternate between randomly sampling a set of agent configuration-time
points, corresponding to interceptions of targets, and finding a sequence of
interception points by solving a generalized TSP (GTSP). This alternation
enables asymptotic convergence to the optimum. We introduce two parallel
algorithms within the IRG framework. The first algorithm, IRG-PGLNS, solves
GTSPs using PGLNS, our parallelized extension of the state-of-the-art solver
GLNS. The second algorithm, Parallel Communicating GTSPs (PCG), solves GTSPs
corresponding to several sets of points simultaneously. We present numerical
results for three variants of the MT-TSP: one where intercepting a target only
requires coming within a particular distance, another where the agent is a
variable-speed Dubins car, and a third where the agent is a redundant robot
arm. We show that IRG-PGLNS and PCG both converge faster than a baseline based
on prior work.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了SocialNav-SUB标准化测试框架，用于评估视觉-语言模型在社交机器人导航场景中的场景理解能力，发现当前最佳VLM仍落后于基准法和人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型在社交机器人导航场景理解方面的能力不明，缺乏系统性评估。需要一个标准化测试框架来评估VLM在空间-时间关系推理和人类意图识别等复杂社交场景中的表现。

Method: 提出SocialNav-SUB标准化测试框架，包含一个视觉问答(VQA)数据集，通过统一框架评估VLM在社交导航场景中的空间、时间和社交推理能力，与人类和规则基准进行对比。

Result: 实验结果显示，虽然最佳VLM与人类答案的一致性有所提升，但仍落后于简单规则方法和人类基准水平，表明当前VLM在社交场景理解方面存在显著缺口。

Conclusion: SocialNav-SUB为社交机器人导航基础模型的研究提供了标准化评估框架，展示了VLM在实际应用中的差距，为下一步研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Robot navigation in dynamic, human-centered environments requires
socially-compliant decisions grounded in robust scene understanding. Recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object
recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities
that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,
it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social
navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents
and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot
navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social
robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to
meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social
Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question
Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene
understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB
provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based
baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social
reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art
VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging
probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler
rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in
social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for
further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a
framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot
navigation needs. An overview of this paper along with the code and data can be
found at https://larg.github.io/socialnav-sub .

TL;DR: JM2D是一个新的生成建模框架，通过联合采样方法解决模型自由扩散规划器与模型优化模块的兼容性问题，无需额外训练即可提高任务性能并保持安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际机器人系统中，模型自由扩散规划器需要与基于模型的优化模块（如安全约束）结合使用，但直接集成时多模态输出与优化模块存在兼容性挑战。

Method: 提出JM2D框架，将模块集成建模为联合采样问题，通过交互势函数最大化兼容性，使用重要性采样仅基于交互势评估来指导模块输出，处理不可微分目标。

Result: 在离线强化学习和机器人操作任务中，JM2D相比传统安全过滤器显著提高了任务性能，同时不牺牲安全性。条件生成是JM2D的特例，与最先进的基于梯度和投影的扩散规划器相比具有优势。

Conclusion: JM2D提供了一种有效的方法来整合模型自由和模型基础的组件，通过联合采样框架解决了兼容性问题，在机器人运动规划中表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Model-free diffusion planners have shown great promise for robot motion
planning, but practical robotic systems often require combining them with
model-based optimization modules to enforce constraints, such as safety.
Naively integrating these modules presents compatibility challenges when
diffusion's multi-modal outputs behave adversarially to optimization-based
modules. To address this, we introduce Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion
(JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework. JM2D formulates module
integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility via an
interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling,
JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction
potential, thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from
non-convex optimization modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning
diffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation.
JM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety
filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional
generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by
comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

TL;DR: Calib3R是一个无需标定板的联合标定与重建方法，通过统一优化实现相机-机器人标定和度量尺度3D重建，支持单/多相机系统，在少于10张图像的情况下就能实现精确标定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人依赖RGB图像进行交互，但可靠的交互需要与机器人坐标系对齐的度量尺度3D场景表示。传统方法需要标定板，而RGB重建只能得到未知尺度的几何，多相机系统更加复杂。

Method: 基于3D基础模型MASt3R从RGB图像提取点云图，结合机器人位姿通过统一优化重建与机器人对齐的度量尺度3D场景，处理单相机和多相机系统。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验表明，Calib3R使用少于10张图像就能实现精确标定，性能优于无目标方法和基于标记的方法。

Conclusion: Calib3R提供了一种无需标定板的联合标定与重建解决方案，能够有效处理机器人系统中的相机标定和3D重建问题。

Abstract: Robots often rely on RGB images for tasks like manipulation and navigation.
However, reliable interaction typically requires a 3D scene representation that
is metric-scaled and aligned with the robot reference frame. This depends on
accurate camera-to-robot calibration and dense 3D reconstruction, tasks usually
treated separately, despite both relying on geometric correspondences from RGB
data. Traditional calibration needs patterns, while RGB-based reconstruction
yields geometry with an unknown scale in an arbitrary frame. Multi-camera
setups add further complexity, as data must be expressed in a shared reference
frame. We present Calib3R, a patternless method that jointly performs
camera-to-robot calibration and metric-scaled 3D reconstruction via unified
optimization. Calib3R handles single- and multi-camera setups on robot arms or
mobile robots. It builds on the 3D foundation model MASt3R to extract pointmaps
from RGB images, which are combined with robot poses to reconstruct a scaled 3D
scene aligned with the robot. Experiments on diverse datasets show that Calib3R
achieves accurate calibration with less than 10 images, outperforming
target-less and marker-based methods.

TL;DR: RoboChemist是一个双循环框架，集成视觉语言模型(VLM)和视觉语言动作模型(VLA)，用于机器人化学实验，在成功率和合规性方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人化学家在处理危险和可变形物质的长时程实验过程中，既要完成任务又要严格遵守实验规范的挑战。现有VLM系统依赖深度感知且难以处理透明实验器皿，而VLA系统缺乏复杂任务的语义级反馈。

Method: 提出双循环框架，利用VLM作为：1)任务分解规划器，2)视觉提示生成器指导VLA模型，3)任务成功和合规性监控器。引入基于图像的视觉目标VLA接口，实现精确的目标条件控制。

Result: 系统成功执行原始动作和完整多步化学协议，平均成功率提高23.57%，合规率平均提高0.298，在物体和任务上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: RoboChemist框架有效解决了机器人化学实验中的复杂控制问题，通过VLM和VLA的协同工作实现了更高的执行成功率和实验规范性。

Abstract: Robotic chemists promise to both liberate human experts from repetitive tasks
and accelerate scientific discovery, yet remain in their infancy. Chemical
experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable
substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict
compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose
\textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based
systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with
transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack
semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve
as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt
generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and
regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts
image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned
control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete
multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate
and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA
baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在优化问题中应用发展迅速，但领域仍缺乏统一的系统性综述和分类法，需要建立结构化框架来整合现有研究

Method: 通过系统性调研，将现有研究分为两个主要阶段：LLM用于优化建模和LLM用于优化求解。后者进一步分为三种范式：LLM作为独立优化器、低级别LLM嵌入优化算法、高级别LLM用于算法选择和生成

Conclusion: 突出了主要限制和研究空白，指明了未来研究方向，为开发自我迭代进化的自主优化系统提供了路线图

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong understanding and reasoning
capabilities, are increasingly being explored for tackling optimization
problems, especially in synergy with evolutionary computation. Despite rapid
progress, however, the field still lacks a unified synthesis and a systematic
taxonomy. This survey addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review of
recent developments and organizing them within a structured framework. We
classify existing research into two main stages: LLMs for optimization modeling
and LLMs for optimization solving. The latter is further divided into three
paradigms according to the role of LLMs in the optimization workflow: LLMs as
stand-alone optimizers, low-level LLMs embedded within optimization algorithms,
and high-level LLMs for algorithm selection and generation. For each category,
we analyze representative methods, distill technical challenges, and examine
their interplay with traditional approaches. We also review interdisciplinary
applications spanning the natural sciences, engineering, and machine learning.
By contrasting LLM-driven and conventional methods, we highlight key
limitations and research gaps, and point toward future directions for
developing self-evolving agentic ecosystems for optimization. An up-to-date
collection of related literature is maintained at
https://github.com/ishmael233/LLM4OPT.
