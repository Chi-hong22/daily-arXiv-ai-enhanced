Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex\noptimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing\ntrajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum\nscreening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach\nsignificantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency\ncompared to conventional convex optimization methods.

The Unconstrained Feature Model (UFM) has been\nproposed to explain NC theoretically, and there emerges a growing body of work\nthat extends NC to tasks other than classification and leverages it for\npractical applications. In this study, we investigate whether a similar\nphenomenon arises in deep Ordinal Regression (OR) tasks, via combining the\ncumulative link model for OR and UFM. We show that a phenomenon we call Ordinal\nNeural Collapse (ONC) indeed emerges and is characterized by the following\nthree properties: (ONC1) all optimal features in the same class collapse to\ntheir within-class mean when regularization is applied; (ONC2) these class\nmeans align with the classifier, meaning that they collapse onto a\none-dimensional subspace; (ONC3) the optimal latent variables (corresponding to\nlogits or preactivations in classification tasks) are aligned according to the\nclass order, and in particular, in the zero-regularization limit, a highly\nlocal and simple geometric relationship emerges between the latent variables\nand the threshold values. We prove these properties analytically within the UFM\nframework with fixed threshold values and corroborate them empirically across a\nvariety of datasets. We also discuss how these insights can be leveraged in OR,\nhighlighting the use of fixed thresholds.", "AI": {"tldr": "论文研究了深度序数回归（OR）任务中是否会出现类似“神经崩溃（NC）”的现象，提出了“序数神经崩溃（ONC）”的概念，并验证了其三个特性。", "motivation": "探索深度神经网络在序数回归任务中的行为，以扩展对神经崩溃现象的理解。", "method": "结合累积链接模型和无约束特征模型（UFM），分析ONC的几何特性。", "result": "证明了ONC的三个特性，并通过实验验证了这些特性。", "conclusion": "ONC现象在序数回归任务中存在，且其几何特性可用于改进OR方法。"}}

Extending EP to time-varying inputs is a\nchallenging problem, as the variational description must apply to the entire\nsystem trajectory rather than just fixed points, and careful consideration of\nboundary conditions becomes essential. In this work, we present Generalized\nLagrangian Equilibrium Propagation (GLEP), which extends the variational\nformulation of EP to time-varying inputs. We demonstrate that GLEP yields\ndifferent learning algorithms depending on the boundary conditions of the\nsystem, many of which are impractical for implementation.

In a similar vein, we find that training a\nrandomly initialized student to imitate an unlearned model transfers desired\nbehaviors while leaving undesired capabilities behind. In other words,\ndistillation robustifies unlearning. Building on this insight, we propose\nUnlearn-Noise-Distill-on-Outputs (UNDO), a scalable method that distills an\nunlearned model into a partially noised copy of itself. UNDO introduces a\ntunable tradeoff between compute cost and robustness, establishing a new Pareto\nfrontier on synthetic language and arithmetic tasks.

At a high level,\neigenspectrum analysis of DNNs involves measuring the heavytailness of the\nempirical spectral densities (ESD) of weight matrices. It provides insight into\nhow well a model is trained and can guide decisions on assigning better\nlayer-wise training hyperparameters. In this paper, we address a challenge\nassociated with such eigenspectrum methods: the impact of the aspect ratio of\nweight matrices on estimated heavytailness metrics. We demonstrate that\nmatrices of varying sizes (and aspect ratios) introduce a non-negligible bias\nin estimating heavytailness metrics, leading to inaccurate model diagnosis and\nlayer-wise hyperparameter assignment. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nFARMS (Fixed-Aspect-Ratio Matrix Subsampling), a method that normalizes the\nweight matrices by subsampling submatrices with a fixed aspect ratio. Instead\nof measuring the heavytailness of the original ESD, we measure the average ESD\nof these subsampled submatrices. We show that measuring the heavytailness of\nthese submatrices with the fixed aspect ratio can effectively mitigate the\naspect ratio bias. We validate our approach across various optimization\ntechniques and application domains that involve eigenspectrum analysis of\nweights, including image classification in computer vision (CV) models,\nscientific machine learning (SciML) model training, and large language model\n(LLM) pruning.
