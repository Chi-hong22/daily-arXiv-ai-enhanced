However, 2DGS\nsuffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling\nrates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in\nscenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that\nthese artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency\nconstraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping\napproach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased\nformulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits\nwhile significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our\nmethod introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the\nfrequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling\nfrequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts\nwhen zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by\nleveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which\nallows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space\nof each splat."}

In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a\ndistributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the\ngrowing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,\npersonalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to\nleverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual\nuser preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,\nmost PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the\ndata and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios.

We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all\nclients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we\npropose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides\ncustomized global models to each client.

Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing\nmodel size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a\npoint prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel\nvariable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a\nrate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach\nyields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we\ncan drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing\nmodel size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of\ninterest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This\nThing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on\nsegmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on\nconsumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or\nrobotics applications."}

To address this issue, a symmetric sliding-mode control (SSMC)\nmethod is developed and its explicit voltage controllable region is derived. It\nillustrates how much ac-side power dynamics and dc-link voltage varying can be\ndecoupled from the voltage regulation task, which helps predict when the\nentangling appears. While conventional sliding-mode controls address\nvoltage-tracking error through complex sliding surface designs, repetitive\ncorrection techniques or special reaching laws, this work identifies that the\nerror at power-line frequency primarily stem from the asymmetry property of\ninverters with the delay effect and the computational inaccuracy.

Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \\emph{limited}\ngeneralizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on\nunseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion\nof covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their\nperformance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.\nWhile TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream\nclassification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in\nforecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting.

This robot initializes\nrandomized pain responses to palpation forces, and the RL agent learns to\nadjust these sounds to align with human preferences. The results demonstrated\nthat the system adapts to an individual's palpation forces and sound\npreferences and captures a broad spectrum of pain intensity, from mild\ndiscomfort to acute distress, through RL-guided exploration of the auditory\npain space. The study further showed that pain sound perception exhibits\nsaturation at lower forces with gender specific thresholds. These findings\nhighlight the system's potential to enhance abdominal palpation training by\noffering a controllable and immersive simulation platform."}

However,\ntraditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically\ndeveloped to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and\namplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal\nsegmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these\nlimitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of\nexisting RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on\ncomplex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet\nintroduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex\nplane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training\nperformance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and\nreal-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of\n98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued\ncounterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet\nachieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,\ncompared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up\nto a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness\nof complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training\nefficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments.

Moreover, due to the unique perspective of\nUAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to\naccurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.\nTo address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in\nadverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment\nTeacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design\ncalled Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which\ndynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating\ntraining progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the\nlearning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for\nlearning features at varying levels of granularity.

This\nstrategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid\nlabels, thus mitigating domain bias.

To address this new task, we propose\na novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects\nchanges. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a\nquery and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint\nmisalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this\nlimitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating\nsemantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our\nframework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and\nsignificantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while\nachieving comparable performance to the oracle setting.

First,\nit extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the\nsingle-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.\nThis improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model\nrepresentation capability.

While BridgeTower further enhances\nperformance by building bridges between encoders, it \\textit{(i)} suffers from\nineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,\n\\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of\nunimodal semantic knowledge, and \\textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on\ntraditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.\nIn this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin\nthat adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained\nunimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.\nFirst, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel\nVLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or\nwithout VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and\nachieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our\nexploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.\nWe demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot\nperformance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,\nand resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is\nenabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the\nmulti-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual\nrepresentation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal\nperspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic\nambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.\nCode and models are available at https://github.com/LooperXX/ManagerTower."}

In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor\ndata rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much\nof the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical\nfeatures such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for\nevaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without\nthe use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle\ntensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we\nconvert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance\nmeasures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in\nfairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct\ngroups.

To address this challenge, we introduce a standard\nanti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for\nanalyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal\nsettings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional\nindependence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label\nto image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables.

In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect\nthose utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern\nASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a\nnotable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the\napproach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a\nmedian word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13%\nof the total speech in the dataset.

This design is fundamental\nto our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains\nits original language representations without adaptation to visual data.\nConsequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the\nLLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model\nto develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our\nexperimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes.
