However, the design of\njournalistic maps may be challenging, as editorial teams need to balance\nmultiple aspects, such as aesthetics, the audience's expected data literacy,\ntight publication deadlines, and the team's technical skills. Data journalists\noften come from multiple areas and lack a cartography, data visualization, and\ndata science background, limiting their competence in creating maps. While\nprevious studies have examined spatial visualizations in data stories, this\nresearch seeks to gain a deeper understanding of the map design process\nemployed by news outlets. To achieve this, we strive to answer two specific\nresearch questions: what is the design space of journalistic maps? and how do\neditorial teams produce journalistic map articles? To answer the first one, we\ncollected and analyzed a large corpus of 462 journalistic maps used in news\narticles from five major news outlets published over three months. As a result,\nwe created a design space comprised of eight dimensions that involved both\nproperties describing the articles' aspects and the visual/interactive features\nof maps. We approach the second research question via semi-structured\ninterviews with four data journalists who create data-driven articles daily.\nThrough these interviews, we identified the most common design rationales made\nby editorial teams and potential gaps in current practices. We also collected\nthe practitioners' feedback on our design space to externally validate it.

But we\ndo not just follow rules and solve problems given to us by others: we modify\nthose rules, create new problems, and set new goals and tasks for ourselves and\nothers. Arguably, even more than rule following and problem solving, human\nintelligence is about creatively breaking and stretching the rules, changing\nthe game, and inventing new problems worth thinking about. Creating a good rule\nor a good problem depends not just on the ideas one can think up but on how one\nevaluates such proposals. Here, we study invention through the lens of game\ndesign. We focus particularly on the early stages of novice, \"everyday\" game\ncreation, where the stakes are low. We draw on a dataset of over 450 human\ncreated games, created by participants who saw an initial seed set of\ntwo-player grid-based strategy games. We consider two different cognitive\nmechanisms that may be at work during the early processes of intuitive game\ninvention: an associative proposal based on previous games one has seen and\ncompute-bounded model-based evaluation that an everyday game creator may use to\nrefine their initial draft proposals. In our preliminary work, we conduct a\nmodel-based analysis of how people invented new games based on prior experience\nand find that generated games are best described by a model which incorporates\nmodel-based estimates of game quality at a population level.

Sheppard (ads.), CRC Press, 2025", "summary": "This chapter serves as an introduction to systems engineering focused on the\nbroad issues surrounding realizing complex integrated systems. What is a\nsystem? We pose a number of possible definitions and perspectives, but leave\nopen the opportunity to consider the system from the target context where it\nwill be used. Once we have a system in mind, we acknowledge the fact that this\nsystem needs to integrate a variety of pieces, components, subsystems, in order\nfor it to accomplish its task. Therefore, we concern ourselves at the\nboundaries and interfaces of different technologies and disciplines to\ndetermine how best to achieve that integration. Next we raise the specter that\nthis integrated system is complex. Complexity can be defined in a number of\nways. For one, the sheer number of subsystems or components can be a measure of\ncomplexity. We could also consider the functions being performed by the system\nand how those functions interact with one another. Further, we could consider\ncomputational aspects such as the time or memory that may be needed to\naccomplish one or more tasks. The extent to which new behaviors might emerge\nfrom the system can also be regarded as an element of complexity. In the end,\ncomplexity is that characteristic of a system that defines the associated\nchallenges along the life of the system, so we are concerned with how to manage\nthat complexity. Finally, realization refers to the process by which our\ncomplex integrated system moves from concept to deployment and subsequent\nsupport. It refers to the entire design, development, manufacture, deployment,\noperation, and support life cycle. Of particular note here, however, is that we\nfocus on systems that, by their very nature, are complex.

To prevent undesired changes in\nidentity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce\na stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the\nsource image.

Accurate anchor positioning, a process known as calibration, is crucial\nfor integrating UWB ranging measurements into state estimation. While several\nprior works have demonstrated satisfactory results by using robot-aided systems\nto autonomously calibrate UWB systems, there are still some limitations: 1)\nthese approaches assume accurate robot localization during the initialization\nstep, ignoring localization errors that can compromise calibration robustness,\nand 2) the calibration results are highly sensitive to the initial guess of the\nUWB anchors' positions, reducing the practical applicability of these methods\nin real-world scenarios.

In this\nwork, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that\nproduces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining.

It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web\ndata and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for\n180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token\nbudget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on\nsynthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to\nrephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.\nOverall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating\nhigh-quality synthetic pretraining data.

The system proactively\nposes diagnostic questions that challenge novices' thinking and helps both\nnovices and mentors plan for more focused and emotionally attuned meetings.\nCritically, mentors can inspect and modify the underlying cognitive model,\nshaping the logic of the system to reflect their evolving needs. Through an\nexploratory field deployment, we found that using the system supported novice\nmetacognition, helped mentors plan emotionally attuned strategies, and improved\nmeeting depth, intentionality, and focus--while also surfaced key tensions\naround trust, misdiagnosis, and expectations of AI. We contribute design\nprinciples for proactive AI systems that scaffold metacognition and human-human\ncollaboration in complex, ill-defined domains, offering implications for\nsimilar domains like healthcare, education, and knowledge work.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bfc\u5e08\u4e0eAI\u7684\u521b\u4e1a\u8f85\u5bfc\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u65b0\u624b\u548c\u5bfc\u5e08\u7684\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f1a\u8bae\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5171\u9e23\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65b0\u624b\u521b\u4e1a\u8005\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bfc\u5e08\u56e0\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7cbe\u529b\u6709\u9650\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u652f\u6301\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8ba4\u77e5\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63d0\u51fa\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4f1a\u8bae\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65b0\u624b\u7684\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5bfc\u5e08\u5236\u5b9a\u60c5\u611f\u5171\u9e23\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u4f1a\u8bae\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e13\u6ce8\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u4fe1\u4efb\u548c\u8bef\u8bca\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u5143\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u3001\u6559\u80b2\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

The further comparison with vanilla\nDAPO shows that the regeneration process achieves a better performance on math\nreasoning tasks while sustaining a high-level entropy degree for exploration.\nIn the second stage, we continue training with static initial-state sampling by\nDAPO, intentionally placing the model in a familiar state to gradually\nstrengthen exploitation.

However, in extreme degradation scenarios\n(e.g., scale $> 8\\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often\nseverely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models\nto reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to\ngenerate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images\nlacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nFSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID\nrestoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.\nOur approach involves three key designs: 1) \\textbf{Masking} the facial region\nin the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)\n\\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style\nguidance; 3) Leveraging \\textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)\nimages for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first\npretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing\nit to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity\nembeddings.

Most prior approaches rely on\nexplicit object pose tracking or handcrafted visual features, limiting their\ngeneralization to novel objects, robustness to visual disturbances, and the\nability to handle deformable objects. Visuomotor learning offers a promising\nalternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low\nsignal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and\nmillimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This\npaper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor\npolicies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a\nsingle stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic\ngrasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical\nobjects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything\nfor Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping.\nGASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception\npipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for\nsafe execution. We train the policy in simulation using domain randomization\nfor sim-to-real transfer and deploy it on a real robot in both phantom-based\nand ex vivo surgical settings, using only a single pair of endoscopic cameras.\nExtensive experiments show our policy achieves a 65% success rate in both\nsettings, generalizes to unseen objects and grippers, and adapts to diverse\ndisturbances, demonstrating strong performance, generality, and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faGASv2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6293\u53d6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u5355\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a65%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u624b\u672f\u6293\u53d6\u53ef\u51cf\u8f7b\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u53d8\u5f62\u5bf9\u8c61\u3002\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u624b\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u3001\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\u548c\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGASv2\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u624b\u672f\u611f\u77e5\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u786e\u4fdd\u5b89\u5168\u6267\u884c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u968f\u673a\u5316\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u523065%\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u5939\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u79cd\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "conclusion": "GASv2\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u624b\u672f\u6293\u53d6\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u624b\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Under review", "summary": "Conformal prediction is a popular uncertainty quantification method that\naugments a base predictor with prediction sets with statistically valid\ncoverage guarantees. However, current methods are often computationally\nexpensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model\nbefore calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the\nprediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture\ndependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by\nintroducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval\npredictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs\nprediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty\nsets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors\ncan be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can\napply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we\nfocus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression\ntasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification\nsettings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible\nclasses. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for\ndetecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical\nexperiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than\ninterval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while\nachieving a similar coverage over the test data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3azono-conformal prediction\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u6d4bzonotopes\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8f93\u51fa\u4e2d\u6355\u6349\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165zono-conformal prediction\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6784\u5efa\u9884\u6d4bzonotopes\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff08\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff09\u3002", "result": "zono-conformal predictors\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u66f4\u4f4e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "zono-conformal prediction\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

The proposed\nmethod transforms the standard trajectory optimization problem into a purely\ngeometric one that involves computing a set of geodesics for a suitable\nRiemannian metric. This transformation is achieved by defining a metric,\nspecifically the Jacobi metric, that embeds the dynamics directly into the\nmetric, so any geodesic of the metric is also a dynamically feasible\ntrajectory. The method finds the fuel-optimal transfer trajectory by sampling\ncandidate energy ($\\Delta V$) changes for different points on the current and\ndesired orbit, and efficiently computing and evaluating each candidate\ngeodesic, which are equivalent to candidate orbit transfer trajectories via the\nJacobi metric. The method bypasses the known issues of optimization-based\nmethods, e.g., sensitivity to the initial guess, and can be applied to more\ncomplex two-body systems. The approach is demonstrated on the minimum-$\\Delta\nV$ two-impulse phase-free orbit transfer problem, first on a Keplerian system\nand second on a system with a modeled $J_2$ perturbation. The proposed method\nis shown to meet or exceed the state-of-the-art methods in the minimum-$\\Delta\nV$ problem in the Keplerian system.

To support LMs while ensuring\nreal-time inference, embodied edge intelligence (EEI) is a promising paradigm,\nwhich leverages an LM edge to provide computing powers in close proximity to\nembodied robots. Due to embodied data exchange, EEI requires higher spectral\nefficiency, enhanced communication security, and reduced inter-user\ninterference. To meet these requirements, near-field communication (NFC), which\nleverages extremely large antenna arrays as its hardware foundation, is an\nideal solution. Therefore, this paper advocates the integration of EEI and NFC,\nresulting in a near-field EEI (NEEI) paradigm. However, NEEI also introduces\nnew challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by isolated EEI or NFC\ndesigns, creating research opportunities for joint optimization of both\nfunctionalities.

This work studies a\nspecial kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and\nmachine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform\nappearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this\nproblem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,\na distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but\ngeometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with\nthis problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of\norientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an\nArtcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate\nthe performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature\nvector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature\nvector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the\nsystem for detecting Artcode proposals.

We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000\nframes captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather\nscenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This\ndataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to\nperform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video\nframes. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected\npotholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and\nframes as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly\nweb interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under\nchallenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road\nassessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the\nwebsite. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable,\noffering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing\nregions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at\nhttps://smlab.niser.ac.in/project/iwatchroad", "AI": {"tldr": "iWatchRoad\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5751\u6d3c\u3001GPS\u6807\u8bb0\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5730\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5370\u5ea6\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u9053\u8def\u73af\u5883\u3002", "motivation": "\u5370\u5ea6\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u7684\u5751\u6d3c\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8f66\u8f86\u5bff\u547d\u6784\u6210\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u6ce8\u91ca\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cYOLO\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5751\u6d3c\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408OCR\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u5e76\u4e0eGPS\u540c\u6b65\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u901a\u8fc7OSM\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u653f\u5e9c\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u9053\u8def\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "iWatchRoad\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u5c55\u4e2d\u56fd\u5bb6\u7684\u9053\u8def\u7ba1\u7406\u3002"}}

Furthermore,\nIPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for\nconstructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced\nreasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of\nthis study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization\nnot only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such\nas autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models\nmust remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u589e\u91cf\u8865\u4e01\u751f\u6210\uff08IPG\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u534711.1\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u653b\u51fb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u5bf9AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6784\u6210\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "IPG\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u5982YOLO\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u679c\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "IPG\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u80fd\u8986\u76d6\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "IPG\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u9632\u5fa1\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u3001\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\uff09\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited\nto single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image\nintegration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive\nnature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce\nMedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language\nmodels on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four\nkey features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction,\nmulti-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core\ntasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn\nquestion answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease\ndiagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates\ntemporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging\nmodalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to\nperform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts.

In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement\nframework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders.\nThis accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with\nsuperior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical\nuse ($60\\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most\ncomprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential\nof FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering\ndiffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability\nin connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample\nsize requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread\nadoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for\ndiffusion MRI enhancement.

ASC is not\npossible without sensors, in particular for accurate positioning data. Spraying\nand the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes.

In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance.\nOur discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools:\n(1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality\nmultimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on\nchallenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate\nevaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of\ntool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the\ntransformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities,\noffering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.\nThe project page of this paper is publicly available\nathttps://github.com/Lackel/Awesome-Tools-for-MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1MLLMs\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u8db3\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u5229\u7528\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5de5\u5177\u589e\u5f3aMLLMs\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u56db\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff1a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6539\u8fdb\u53ca\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u662f\u63a8\u52a8MLLMs\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7d22\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However,\nmost existing methods are trained offline and lack mechanisms to adapt to new\nenvironments during deployment. As a result, their generalization ability\ndiminishes when faced with unseen variations in real-world driving scenarios.\nIn this paper, we break away from the conventional \"train once, deploy forever\"\nparadigm and propose EvoPSF, a novel online Evolution framework for autonomous\ndriving based on Planning-State Feedback. We argue that planning failures are\nprimarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such\nfailures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To\naddress this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution,\nusing it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than\nperforming blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to\nidentify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are\nprimarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we\ncompute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints\nfrom the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from\nthe perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then\nbackpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the\nmodel's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion\npredictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors.\nExperiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset\ndemonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under\nchallenging conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u72b6\u6001\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6EvoPSF\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89e6\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u4e3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e6\u53d1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u5173\u952e\u5bf9\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cEvoPSF\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoPSF\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u8fdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Third, we study statistical guarantees of\nPAR-regularized linear regression problems; specifically, we can approximate\nclassical formulations of $\\ell_1$-, squared $\\ell_2$-, and nonconvex\nregularizations using PAR and obtain similar statistical guarantees with\nquantized solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5206\u6bb5\u4eff\u5c04\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08PAR\uff09\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cPAR\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u79cdPAR\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8fd1\u7aef\u6620\u5c04\u53ca\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u4e86PAR\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u6563\u6216\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86PAR\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u6027\u3001\u95ed\u5f0f\u8fd1\u7aef\u6620\u5c04\u53ca\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u8fd1\u7aef\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u3001ADMM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86PAR\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cPAR\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u79cdPAR\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8fd1\u7aef\u6620\u5c04\u53ca\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1bPAR\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7ecf\u5178\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e76\u83b7\u5f97\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "PAR\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While early research focused on unconditional sampling,\npractitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise\nspecification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants\nprecise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases\nlatency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and\ndenoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce\nEVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead\nwithout retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual\ncaching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we\nfirst profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained\ncontrol, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A\nlocality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the\ncontrol signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.\nFor temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to\nimprove efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,\nWan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image\nand video control generation without the need for training.

Webb"], "title": "Towards the Next-generation Bayesian Network Classifiers", "comment": null, "summary": "Bayesian network classifiers provide a feasible solution to tabular data\nclassification, with a number of merits like high time and memory efficiency,\nand great explainability. However, due to the parameter explosion and data\nsparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order\nfeature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the\noccurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose\na novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning\ndistributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in\nword embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional\nrepresentations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different\nfeatures through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which\nthen serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new\ntest samples.

In this paper, we introduce Grab-n-Go, the first\nwearable device that leverages active acoustic sensing to recognize subtle hand\nmicrogestures while holding various objects. Unlike prior systems that focus\nsolely on free-hand gestures or basic hand-object activity recognition,\nGrab-n-Go simultaneously captures information about hand microgestures,\ngrasping poses, and object geometries using a single wristband, enabling the\nrecognition of fine-grained hand movements occurring within activities\ninvolving occupied hands. A deep learning framework processes these complex\nsignals to identify 30 distinct microgestures, with 6 microgestures for each of\nthe 5 grasping poses. In a user study with 10 participants and 25 everyday\nobjects, Grab-n-Go achieved an average recognition accuracy of 92.0%.

This potential has\nbeen partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various\nfine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned\nvariants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data\nthat often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional\nshifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range\nof medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a\ntraining-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both\ngeneralist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical\nimage segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that\nrely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we\npropose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal\nlayer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we\ndevelop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and\ngeneralizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and\nmulti-objective optimization respectively.

Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal\npatterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full\ncohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese\n(n = 620) subgroups separately.

Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.\nThere were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal\nmuscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or\nfat-laden pancreas.

Therefore, this study focuses on\nimproving prediction performance in early-stage risk assessments. Our solution,\n\\textbf{Borrowing From the Future (BFF)}, is a contrastive multi-modal\nframework that treats each time window as a distinct modality. In BFF, a model\nis trained on all available data throughout the time while performing a risk\nassessment using up-to-date information.

However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and\ntransmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which\nlimits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection\n(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain\nadaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training\nparadigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse\ncaused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense\nobjects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain\nannotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision\nfoundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised\nframework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision\nFoundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a \"free lunch\" manner,\nleveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise\nwhile improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we\nintroduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's\nsemantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated\npseudo-labels.

However, their performance often\ndegrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features\nhigh resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints.\nThese challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured\naerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a\nlightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained\nusing a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nmulti-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy\noptimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning\nthrough rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model\ntraining and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question\nanswering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples\ncovering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,\ntransportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results\nshow that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the\nQwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which\nis 36x larger, on multiple tasks.

Gradient-based DFL requires computing\nthe derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the\npredicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear\nprograms (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted\nparameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches\nfor LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP\ninto a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer\nand then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that\nhave informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former\napproach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the\nregret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address\nthis, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable\noptimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable\noptimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than\nsurrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds\nfor DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs,\nthat computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can\nbe performed using feedforward neural network layers.

However, existing methods struggle to align with\nfine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion\nnaturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the\ndifficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often\nconflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality\ndatasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we\nfirst introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns\nhuman-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy\nmultidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a\nlarge-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K\npreference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert\nPreference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based\nportrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO\ndecouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused\nacross timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained\nenhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments\ndemonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in\naligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial\nimprovements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and\nvisual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and\nquantitative evaluations.

In parallel,\nthe content features are aligned with image crop representations and\nconstrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation\nfor open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and\nsegmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D\nobject pose estimation.} Code is available at\nhttps://github.com/xiaomoguhz/DeCLIP", "AI": {"tldr": "DeCLIP\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026CLIP\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53d6\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bc6\u96c6\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bc6\u96c6\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff1bCLIP\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDeCLIP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u8026CLIP\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "DeCLIP\u57282D\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u5272\u30013D\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u548c6D\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DeCLIP\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bc6\u96c6\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, monocular\nendoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,\nincluding depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent\nendoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To\novercome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue\nreconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with\ntemporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework\nincorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust\ninitialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in\nconjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth\nestimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel\ncorrespondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on\nLPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from\nphysiological tissue deformation and motion.

These dramatically simplify the\nnecessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wise\nrecursive relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs and\ncertain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict the\ntraining dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of our\nframework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivations\nto NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariant\nnonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK.

A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object\nmotion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in\nsimple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with\ninaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between\nobjects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing\ngeometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant\nobjects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address\nthis, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable\nspatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency\nTracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified\nspatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative\ntrajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our\ncue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature\nrepresentations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a\ndynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for\nstable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open\nDatasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful\ngenerative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable\nimage classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by\nrandomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising\neffects with different category conditions to classify categories.\nUnfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise\ninstability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance\nchanges. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always\nensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces\nthe classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in\nDC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the\ninstability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two\nprinciples: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,\nwe propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)\nnoise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a\ndataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly\ninitialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a\nMeta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise\noffset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to\nreplace random noise.

When adopting a transformer-based detection model to\nperform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning\nthe detection performance on previously learned categories may severely\ndegenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)\nto mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based\ndetection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a\ncorrespondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase\ndetection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched\nqueries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,\nHungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of\nthe current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at\ndifferent iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each\nquery may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of\npreviously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we\npropose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation\n(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD\nestablishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase\nmodels that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned\ndistillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of\nprevious categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic\nand spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new\ncategories.

While supervised deep\nlearning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on\nextensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical\nworkflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often\nstruggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In\nthis study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot\nsegmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first\ntrains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to\nproduce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically\nprocessed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,\nwhich are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The\nproposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice\ncoefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS.

Even with scaled-up models and massive\ndatasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable,\nlargely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we\nintroduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot\nvideos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the\nfilm editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with\ndetailed shot annotations.

A growing body of works have\nemerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,\nthese anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be\ntrained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly\ngeneration framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s\nstrong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a\nnormal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and\nnatural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in\nother regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement\n(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion\nbased on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in\nspecific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual\ntokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies\nneed to be more natural and plausible with object in given image.

Despite the growing interest and efforts in this\nfield, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)\nlack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for\nsufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a\ntrajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.\nTrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation\nNetwork (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data\npreprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports\nbroadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to\nlearn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet\nlearns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual\nfeatures with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive\nloss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an\nunsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video\ndatasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,\nsoccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,\nsports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results\ndemonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video\nretrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in\naction spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action\ncategories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.\nAdditionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications\nbased on TrajSV.", "AI": {"tldr": "TrajSV\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u8f68\u8ff9\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u8f68\u8ff9\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "TrajSV\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001Clip Representation Network (CRNet)\u548cVideo Representation Network (VRNet)\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8f68\u8ff9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684Transformer\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u4e09\u91cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTrajSV\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u8fd170%\uff0c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d9/17\u7c7b\u522b\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u5b57\u5e55\u63d0\u5347\u8fd120%\u3002", "conclusion": "TrajSV\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f53\u80b2\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches struggle\nto effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended\nsettings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in\nadvance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for\nmulti-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is\nmotivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains\nproduce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when\noperating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base\nmodel than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two\nobservations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,\nwhich nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method\noperates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing\ncosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base\nmodel. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight\nmatrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain\ndrift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that\nincorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We\nextend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling\ninference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool.

This approach not only\nfacilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,\nrotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,\nall while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these\noperations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:\nan initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,\nfollowed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually\ncollect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the\nlearning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy\nOptimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies\ndistinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning\nexploration with code execution precision.
