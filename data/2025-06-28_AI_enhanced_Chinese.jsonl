Each\nadvertiser directs their agent to optimize a valuation-dependent objective\nsubject to return-on-investment (ROI) or budget constraints. Given their\nrelevance, there has been a surge in literature studying the liquid welfare\nprice of anarchy (POA) of core auction formats in autobidding, among which\nsimultaneous first-price auctions (FPA). These models capture a large range of\nheterogeneous agent behaviors, requiring advanced proofs to derive tight POA\nbounds. Recently, Deng et al. (NeurIPS 2024) showed that the POA of FPA for\nmixed autobidders (i.e., value and utility maximizers) under ROI is 2.18 for\nadditive valuations.\n  We extend the smoothness framework of Syrgkanis and Tardos (STOC 2013) to\nautobidding. A key contribution is a technique to balance smoothness parameters\nacross heterogeneous agent types. Finding the best POA bound reduces to solving\na POA-revealing mathematical program. Our approach has three strengths: (1)\nSimplicity: We prove smoothness for single-item FPA. Results for simultaneous\nFPA follow via our theorem. For example, by showing smoothness for value and\nutility maximizers, we obtain the tight POA of 2.18 for mixed autobidding. (2)\nExtendibility: Our Extension Theorem adapts to simultaneous FPA with reserve\nprices and agents with fractionally subadditive valuations and heterogeneous\npayment sensitivities and target ROI parameters. We establish the first\n(mostly) tight POA bounds for several models beyond the autobidding state of\nthe art. (3) Generality: Our framework bounds the POA of coarse correlated\nequilibria (CCE), which arise when hybrid agents employ regret-minimizing\nalgorithms.
