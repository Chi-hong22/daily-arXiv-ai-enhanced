The main difficulties and challenges lie in achieving a balance\nbetween complexity and performance according to the characteristics of the\ntask. In this paper, we propose an intra-inter set knowledge distillation (KD)\nframework with time-frequency calibration (I$^2$S-TFCKD) for SE. Different from\nprevious distillation strategies for SE, the proposed framework fully utilizes\nthe time-frequency differential information of speech while promoting global\nknowledge flow. Firstly, we propose a multi-layer interactive distillation\nbased on dual-stream time-frequency cross-calibration, which calculates the\nteacher-student similarity calibration weights in the time and frequency\ndomains respectively and performs cross-weighting, thus enabling refined\nallocation of distillation contributions across different layers according to\nspeech characteristics. Secondly, we construct a collaborative distillation\nparadigm for intra-set and inter-set correlations. Within a correlated set,\nmulti-layer teacher-student features are pairwise matched for calibrated\ndistillation. Subsequently, we generate representative features from each\ncorrelated set through residual fusion to form the fused feature set that\nenables inter-set knowledge interaction.

In this work, we\npropose Fed-HeLLo, a novel federated LoRA-based fine-tuning framework that\nenables clients to collaboratively fine-tune an FM with different local\ntrainable LoRA layers. To ensure its effectiveness, we develop several\nheterogeneous LoRA allocation (HLA) strategies that adaptively allocate local\ntrainable LoRA layers based on clients' resource capabilities and the layer\nimportance. Specifically, based on the dynamic layer importance, we design a\nFisher Information Matrix score-based HLA that leverages dynamic gradient norm\ninformation. To better stabilize the training process, we consider the\nintrinsic importance of LoRA layers and design a Geometrically-Defined HLA\nstrategy. It shapes the collective distribution of trainable LoRA layers into\nspecific geometric patterns, such as Triangle, Inverted Triangle, Bottleneck,\nand Uniform. Moreover, we extend GD-HLA into a randomized version, named\nRandomized Geometrically-Defined HLA, for enhanced model accuracy with\nrandomness. By co-designing the proposed HLA strategies, we incorporate both\nthe dynamic and intrinsic layer importance into the design of our HLA strategy.\nWe evaluate our approach on five datasets under diverse federated LoRA\nfine-tuning settings, covering three levels of data distribution from IID to\nextreme Non-IID.

ENN has $O(N)$ query time and omits hyperparameter fitting,\nleaving uncertainty uncalibrated. To accommodate the lack of calibration, we\nemploy an acquisition method based on Pareto-optimal tradeoffs between\npredicted value and uncertainty. Our proposed method, TuRBO-ENN, replaces the\nGP surrogate in TuRBO with ENN and its Thompson sampling acquisition method\nwith our Pareto-based alternative.
