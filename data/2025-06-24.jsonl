To incentivize the agent, the\nprincipal offers a contract specifying the fraction of the reward to be paid,\nand the agent responds with their optimal action set.

The project page:\n  https://github.com/deep-optimization/Morse", "summary": "In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for\naccelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to\nreformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking\nadvantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies.\nSpecifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with\neach other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot\nmodels run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly\nattaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime\nefficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot\nmodels, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a\nlossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling\nstep budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation\ntasks.

However, both researchers and practitioners in the AV field\noverwhelmingly concentrate on models/algorithms while undervaluing the DQ. To\nfulfill the needs of the next-generation AVs with guarantees of functionality,\nefficiency, and trustworthiness, this paper proposes a novel task-centric and\ndata quality vase framework which consists of five layers: data layer, DQ\nlayer, task layer, application layer, and goal layer. The proposed framework\naims to map DQ with task requirements and performance goals. To illustrate, a\ncase study investigating redundancy on the nuScenes dataset proves that\npartially removing redundancy on multisource image data could improve YOLOv8\nobject detection task performance.

A key challenge in managing and securing these\ndevices is accurate identification and classification. To address this\nchallenge, specific emitter identification techniques have emerged as a\npromising solution that aims to provide reliable and efficient means of\nidentifying individual radiation devices in a unified and standardized manner.\nThis research proposes an approach that leverages transient energy spectrum\nanalysis using the General Linear Chirplet Transform to extract features from\nRF devices. A dataset comprising nine RF devices is utilized, with each sample\ncontaining 900 attributes and a total of 1080 equally distributed samples\nacross the devices. These features are then used in a classification modeling\nframework. To overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning\nmethods, we introduce a hybrid deep learning model called the CNN-Bi-GRU for\nlearning the identification of RF devices based on their transient\ncharacteristics.

We introduce Scene-R1, a video-grounded framework that learns to\nreason about 3D scenes without any point-wise 3D instance supervision by\npairing reinforcement-learning-driven reasoning with a two-stage grounding\npipeline. In the temporal grounding stage, we explicitly reason about the video\nand select the video snippets most relevant to an open-ended query.

After that, we track the object using SAM2 to produce\npixel-accurate masks in RGB frames, and project them back into 3D, thereby\neliminating the need for 3D detector-based proposals while capturing fine\ngeometry and material cues. Scene-R1 can also adapt to the 3D visual question\nanswering task to answer free-form questions directly from video.

However, these labeled\nsupport samples are often underutilized--they are only used for similarity\ncomparison, despite their potential to fine-tune and adapt the metric space\nitself to the classes in the current episode. To address this, we propose a\nseries of simple yet effective episode-specific, during-inference fine-tuning\nmethods for metric-based models, including Rotational Division Fine-Tuning\n(RDFT) and its two variants, Iterative Division Fine-Tuning (IDFT) and\nAugmented Division Fine-Tuning (ADFT).

A\nuser study further confirms that reducing visual motion leads to improved\nperceptual comfort and alleviated cybersickness symptoms. These findings\ndemonstrate that perceptually guided modulation of optical flow provides an\neffective and scalable approach to creating more user-friendly immersive\nexperiences.

To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both\ndancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and\nadopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages.

We train both transformers to learn to\npredict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to\niteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during\ninference.

The\nscore matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for\nunderstanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain\nplausible while differing significantly from their training images. In\nparticular, as explained in (Kamb \\& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,\n(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we\nwould only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.\nHowever, as shown by Kamb \\& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the\nscore is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself\n(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples\nthat globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise\n`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role\nof self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in\nthis direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose\nscore is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer.

In this work, we propose RoboArena, a new approach for\nscalable evaluation of generalist robot policies in the real world. Instead of\nstandardizing evaluations around fixed tasks, environments, or locations, we\npropose to crowd-source evaluations across a distributed network of evaluators.\nImportantly, evaluators can freely choose the tasks and environments they\nevaluate on, enabling easy scaling of diversity, but they are required to\nperform double-blind evaluations over pairs of policies. Then, by aggregating\npreference feedback from pairwise comparisons across diverse tasks and\nenvironments, we can derive a ranking of policies. We instantiate our approach\nacross a network of evaluators at seven academic institutions using the DROID\nrobot platform. Through more than 600 pairwise real-robot evaluation episodes\nacross seven generalist policies, we demonstrate that our crowd-sourced\napproach can more accurately rank the performance of existing generalist\npolicies than conventional, centralized evaluation approaches, while being more\nscalable, resilient, and trustworthy.

This raises a\ncritical question: how can we design physically realizable, scene-adaptive, and\ntransferable attacks against SDE under realistic constraints?\n  To answer this, we make two key contributions. First, we propose a unified\nattack framework that extends optimization-based techniques to four core stages\nof stereo matching: feature extraction, cost-volume construction, cost\naggregation, and disparity regression. A comprehensive stage-wise evaluation\nacross 9 mainstream SDE models, under constraints like photometric consistency,\nreveals that optimization-based patches suffer from poor transferability.\nInterestingly, partially transferable patches suggest that patterns, rather\nthan pixel-level perturbations, may be key to generalizable attacks.

In\norder to analyze the dynamic and static components of videos acquired under\nundesirable conditions, such as hardware, environmental, and power limitations,\nit is essential to establish an FBS method that can handle videos with low\nframe rates and various types of noise. Existing FBS methods have two\nlimitations that prevent us from accurately separating foreground and\nbackground components from such degraded videos. First, they only capture\neither data-specific or general features of the components. Second, they do not\ninclude explicit models for various types of noise to remove them in the FBS\nprocess. To this end, we propose a robust FBS method with a CSR-based\nforeground model. This model can adaptively capture specific spatial structures\nscattered in imaging data. Then, we formulate FBS as a constrained multiconvex\noptimization problem that incorporates CSR, functions that capture general\nfeatures, and explicit noise characterization functions for multiple types of\nnoise. Thanks to these functions, our method captures both data-specific and\ngeneral features to accurately separate the components from various types of\nnoise even under low frame rates. To obtain a solution of the optimization\nproblem, we develop an algorithm that alternately solves its two convex\nsubproblems by newly established algorithms.

At the\ncore of PeepLoc is (a) a mechanism which allows any Wi-Fi device to obtain\nnon-cooperative time-of-flight (ToF) to any Wi-Fi AP and (b) a novel\nbootstrapping mechanism that relies on pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) and\ncrowdsourcing to opportunistically initialize pre-existing APs as anchor points\nwithin an environment. We implement PeepLoc using commodity hardware and\nevaluate it extensively across 4 campus buildings. We show PeepLoc leads to a\nmean and median positional error of 3.41 m and 3.06 m respectively, which is\nsuperior to existing deployed indoor localization systems and is competitive\nwith commodity GPS in outdoor environments."}

Specifically, we start with the observation that\nwhen trained to learn a mixture of tasks, as is popular in the literature, the\nstrategies learned by a model for performing ICL can be captured by a family of\nBayesian predictors: a memorizing predictor, which assumes a discrete prior on\nthe set of seen tasks, and a generalizing predictor, wherein the prior matches\nthe underlying task distribution. Adopting the lens of rational analysis from\ncognitive science, where a learner's behavior is explained as an optimal\nadaptation to data given computational constraints, we develop a hierarchical\nBayesian framework that almost perfectly predicts Transformer next token\npredictions throughout training without assuming access to its weights. Under\nthis framework, pretraining is viewed as a process of updating the posterior\nprobability of different strategies, and its inference-time behavior as a\nposterior-weighted average over these strategies' predictions. Our framework\ndraws on common assumptions about neural network learning dynamics, which make\nexplicit a tradeoff between loss and complexity among candidate strategies:\nbeyond how well it explains the data, a model's preference towards implementing\na strategy is dictated by its complexity. This helps explain well-known ICL\nphenomena, while offering novel predictions: e.g., we show a superlinear trend\nin the timescale for transition to memorization as task diversity is increased.\nOverall, our work advances an explanatory and predictive account of ICL\ngrounded in tradeoffs between strategy loss and complexity."}

Proper scoring rules assess the quality\nof predictions and require that the expected score gets uniquely maximized at\nthe precise prediction, in which case we call the score directly elicits the\nproperty. Previous research work has widely studied the existence and the\ncharacterization of proper scoring rules for different properties, but little\nliterature discusses the choice of proper scoring rules for applications at\nhand. In this paper, we explore a novel task, the indirect elicitation of\nproperties with parametric assumptions, where the target property is a function\nof several directly-elicitable sub-properties and the total score is a weighted\nsum of proper scoring rules for each sub-property. Because of the restriction\nto a parametric model class, different settings for the weights lead to\ndifferent constrained optimal solutions. Our goal is to figure out how the\nchoice of weights affects the estimation of the target property and which\nchoice is the best. We start it with simulation studies and observe an\ninteresting pattern: in most cases, the optimal estimation of the target\nproperty changes monotonically with the increase of each weight, and the best\nconfiguration of weights is often to set some weights as zero. To understand\nhow it happens, we first establish the elementary theoretical framework and\nthen provide deeper sufficient conditions for the case of two sub-properties\nand of more sub-properties respectively. The theory on 2-D cases perfectly\ninterprets the experimental results.

Weakly supervised learning\nprovides a more efficient alternative by leveraging sparse and coarse\nannotations instead of dense, precise ones. However, segmentation performance\ndegradation and overfitting caused by sparse annotations remain key challenges.\nTo address these issues, we propose CmFNet, a novel 3D weakly supervised\ncross-modal medical image segmentation approach. CmFNet consists of three main\ncomponents: a modality-specific feature learning network, a cross-modal feature\nlearning network, and a hybrid-supervised learning strategy. Specifically, the\nmodality-specific feature learning network and the cross-modal feature learning\nnetwork effectively integrate complementary information from multi-modal\nimages, enhancing shared features across modalities to improve segmentation\nperformance. Additionally, the hybrid-supervised learning strategy guides\nsegmentation through scribble supervision, intra-modal regularization, and\ninter-modal consistency, modeling spatial and contextual relationships while\npromoting feature alignment. Our approach effectively mitigates overfitting,\ndelivering robust segmentation results. It excels in segmenting both\nchallenging small tumor regions and common anatomical structures.

This was\naccomplished using a novel framework which included a Partitioned\nCross-Attention (PCA) projector, a Group-Wise Linear (GL) projector, and a\nmulti-view robust training method.

As permafrost\nthaw accelerates due to climate change, it threatens infrastructure stability\nand key ecosystem services, such as soil carbon storage. High-resolution soil\nmaps are essential for characterizing permafrost distribution, identifying\nvulnerable areas, and informing adaptation strategies.

We compare MISO with Random\nForest (RF), a traditional ML model that has been widely used in soil mapping\napplications. Spatial cross-validation and regional analysis across Permafrost\nZones and Major Land Resource Areas (MLRAs) show that MISO generalizes better\nto remote, unseen locations and achieves higher recall than RF, which is\ncritical for monitoring permafrost thaw and related environmental processes.\nThese findings demonstrate the potential of advanced ML approaches for\nfine-scale soil mapping and provide practical guidance for future soil sampling\nand infrastructure planning in permafrost-affected landscapes.

The\nbiometric templates from different model instances are so strongly incompatible\nthat the cross-instance similarity score for images of the same person is\ntypically lower than the same-instance similarity score for images of different\npersons.

Despite large-scale success, there remain significant\nchallenges including their reliance on extensive computational and memory\nresources for pre-training on huge datasets as well as difficulties in\ntask-specific transfer learning. These limitations coupled with energy\ninefficiencies mainly arise due to the computation-intensive self-attention\nmechanism. To address these issues, we propose a novel Super-Pixel Based Patch\nPooling (SPPP) technique that generates context-aware, semantically rich, patch\nembeddings to effectively reduce the architectural complexity and improve\nefficiency. Additionally, we introduce the Light Latent Attention (LLA) module\nin our pipeline by integrating latent tokens into the attention mechanism\nallowing cross-attention operations to significantly reduce the time and space\ncomplexity of the attention module. By leveraging the data-intuitive patch\nembeddings coupled with dynamic positional encodings, our approach adaptively\nmodulates the cross-attention process to focus on informative regions while\nmaintaining the global semantic structure. This targeted attention improves\ntraining efficiency and accelerates convergence. Notably, the SPPP module is\nlightweight and can be easily integrated into existing transformer\narchitectures.

The\nscore matching perspective on diffusion has proven particularly fruitful for\nunderstanding how and why diffusion models generate images that remain\nplausible while differing significantly from their training images. In\nparticular, as explained in (Kamb \\& Ganguli, 2024) and others, e.g.,\n(Ambrogioni, 2023), theory suggests that if our score matching were optimal, we\nwould only be able to recover training samples through our diffusion process.\nHowever, as shown by Kamb \\& Ganguli, (2024), in diffusion models where the\nscore is parametrized by a simple CNN, the inductive biases of the CNN itself\n(translation equivariance and locality) allow the model to generate samples\nthat globally do not match any training samples, but are rather patch-wise\n`mosaics'. Notably, however, this theory does not extend to describe the role\nof self-attention in this process. In this work, we take a preliminary step in\nthis direction to extend this theory to the case of diffusion models whose\nscore is parametrized by a CNN with a final self-attention layer.

The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type,\nbut operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling\nefficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash\nmodel, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the\nobservations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash\nmodel, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the\nDash model without jump sampling.

However, designing effective TFs remains\nunintuitive due to the semantic gap between user intent and TF parameter space.\nResearchers have developed numerous TF optimization methods to bridge this gap.\nHowever, existing methods still face two challenges: large exploration space\nand weak generalizability. To address these issues, we propose What You Think\nis What You Get (WYTWYG) framework, which leveraging Multi-model Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) to guide the TF optimization based on user intent. Specifically,\nwe first introduce a novel TF optimization approach comprising two core\ncomponents: (1) an evolution-based explorer for effective exploration of the TF\nspace, and (2) a volume rendering quality evaluator based on MLLMs to provide\ngeneralizable visual guidance. We further propose a TF interactive design\nsystem based on this approach. We demonstrate the general applicability of our\nframework through three case studies, and validate the effectiveness of each\ncomponent through extensive experiments.

In this paper, we propose an IMU-free and\nfeature-association-free framework to achieve aggressive ego-motion velocity\nestimation of a robot platform in highly dynamic scenarios by combining two\ntypes of exteroceptive sensors, an event camera and a millimeter wave radar,\nFirst, we used instantaneous raw events and Doppler measurements to derive\nrotational and translational velocities directly. Without a sophisticated\nassociation process between measurement frames, the proposed method is more\nrobust in texture-less and structureless environments and is more\ncomputationally efficient for edge computing devices. Then, in the back-end, we\npropose a continuous-time state-space model to fuse the hybrid time-based and\nevent-based measurements to estimate the ego-motion velocity in a fixed-lagged\nsmoother fashion.

Although various algorithmic\nand data-centric methods have been proposed to address such biases, they often\nrequire retraining or significant compute. In this work, we propose a cheap,\ntraining-free method inspired by steering vectors used to edit behaviors in\nlarge language models. We compute the difference in mean activations between\nmajority and minority groups to define a \"bias vector,\" which we subtract from\nthe model's residual stream.

In this\npaper, we propose TCDiff++, a music-driven end-to-end framework designed to\ngenerate harmonious group dance.

To address the issue of single-dancer foot sliding, we\nintroduce a swap mode embedding to indicate dancer swapping patterns and design\na Footwork Adaptor to refine raw motion, thereby minimizing foot sliding. For\nlong group dance generation, we present a long group diffusion sampling\nstrategy that reduces abrupt position shifts by injecting positional\ninformation into the noisy input.

The key challenge of this task lies in the inherent\ncomplexities of two-person dance interactions, where the partners need to\nsynchronize both with each other and with the music. Inspired by the recent\nadvances in motion synthesis, we propose a two-stage solution: encoding\ntwo-person motions into discrete tokens and then generating these tokens from\nmusic. To effectively capture intricate interactions, we represent both\ndancers' motions as a unified whole to learn the necessary motion tokens, and\nadopt a coarse-to-fine learning strategy in both the stages. Our first stage\nutilizes a VQ-VAE that hierarchically separates high-level semantic features at\na coarse temporal resolution from low-level details at a finer resolution,\nproducing two discrete token sequences at different abstraction levels.\nSubsequently, in the second stage, two generative masked transformers learn to\nmap music signals to these dance tokens: the first producing high-level\nsemantic tokens, and the second, conditioned on music and these semantic\ntokens, producing the low-level tokens. We train both transformers to learn to\npredict randomly masked tokens within the sequence, enabling them to\niteratively generate motion tokens by filling an empty token sequence during\ninference. Through the hierarchical masked modeling and dedicated interaction\nrepresentation, DuetGen achieves the generation of synchronized and interactive\ntwo-person dances across various genres.

Extracting meaningful local descriptors from a query point cloud\nthat can be matched with the descriptors of the collected point clouds is a\nchallenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has\nbeen transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we\npropose a novel methodology, named TDACloud, using Topological Data Analysis\n(TDA) for local descriptor extraction from a point cloud, which does not need\nresource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we\nused the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. Unlike\nvoxelization, our proposed technique can take raw point clouds as inputs and\noutputs a fixed-size TDA-descriptor vector. To test the quality of the proposed\nTDACloud technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford\nRobotCar, KITTI-360) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for\nobject and place recognition. We have also tested TDACloud on noisy and\ntransformed test cases where the query point cloud has been scaled, translated,\nor rotated.
