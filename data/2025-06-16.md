### [1] [Poutine: Vision-Language-Trajectory Pre-Training and Reinforcement Learning Post-Training Enable Robust End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11234)
*Luke Rowe,Rodrigue de Schaetzen,Roger Girgis,Christopher Pal,Liam Paull*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Poutine是一个3B参数的视觉语言模型，专为长尾驾驶场景的端到端自动驾驶设计，通过两阶段训练（自监督预训练和强化学习微调）实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长尾驾驶场景中的自动驾驶挑战，提升模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 1. 自监督视觉-语言-轨迹（VLT）预训练；2. 使用GRPO进行强化学习微调。

Result: Poutine-Base验证集RFS为8.12，接近专家水平；最终模型在Waymo测试集上RFS为7.99，排名第一。

Conclusion: VLT预训练和轻量级强化学习微调是实现鲁棒自动驾驶的有效方法。

Abstract: We present Poutine, a 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) tailored for
end-to-end autonomous driving in long-tail driving scenarios. Poutine is
trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train
Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token
prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo
long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a
72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled
frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL
fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail.
Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation
set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model
achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025
Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. These
results highlight the promise of scalable VLT pre-training and lightweight RL
fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomy.

### [2] [Gondola: Grounded Vision Language Planning for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11261)
*Shizhe Chen,Ricardo Garcia,Paul Pacaud,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Gondola是一种基于LLM的新型视觉语言规划模型，通过多视角图像和历史计划生成带有目标对象和位置分割掩码的行动计划，显著提升了机器人在未见过的对象、环境和任务中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作在泛化到由多样化语言指令指定的未见过的对象、环境和任务方面面临挑战，现有方法在视觉环境中的计划生成和对象定位上表现不足。

Method: Gondola采用多视角图像和历史计划作为输入，生成带有文本和目标对象分割掩码的行动计划，并通过RLBench模拟器构建三类数据集进行训练。

Result: Gondola在GemBench数据集的四个泛化级别（新放置、刚性对象、铰接对象和长时程任务）上均优于现有基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: Gondola通过多视角输入和分割掩码显著提升了机器人操作的泛化能力，为视觉语言规划模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across
unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language
instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has
incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution.
While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in
visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual
instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are
typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise
object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded
vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic
manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the
next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target
objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three
types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning,
multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola
outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four
generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements,
rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.

### [3] [Demonstration Sidetracks: Categorizing Systematic Non-Optimality in Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11262)
*Shijie Fang,Hang Yu,Qidi Fang,Reuben M. Aronson,Elaine S. Short*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文研究了非专家演示中的非最优行为，发现这些行为是系统性的，称为“演示偏离”。通过实验识别了四种偏离类型，并指出其对LfD算法改进的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LfD方法通常将人类演示中的不完美视为随机噪声，但本文认为这些非最优行为是系统性的，需要更深入理解。

Method: 通过40名参与者的公共空间实验，模拟并标注演示数据，识别了四种偏离类型和一种控制模式。

Result: 发现偏离行为在参与者中普遍存在，且其时空分布与任务上下文相关；控制模式依赖于界面设计。

Conclusion: 需改进对非最优演示的建模，以提升LfD算法，缩小实验室训练与实际部署的差距。

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach for robots to acquire
new skills, but most LfD methods suffer from imperfections in human
demonstrations. Prior work typically treats these suboptimalities as random
noise. In this paper we study non-optimal behaviors in non-expert
demonstrations and show that they are systematic, forming what we call
demonstration sidetracks. Using a public space study with 40 participants
performing a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and
annotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks
(Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension
control). Sidetracks appear frequently across participants, and their temporal
and spatial distribution is tied to task context. We also find that users'
control patterns depend on the control interface. These insights point to the
need for better models of suboptimal demonstrations to improve LfD algorithms
and bridge the gap between lab training and real-world deployment. All
demonstrations, infrastructure, and annotations are available at
https://github.com/AABL-Lab/Human-Demonstration-Sidetracks.

Conclusion: 该方法简化了传感器模态的集成，适用于模块化多智能体场景和运行时扩展的机器人平台。

Abstract: We present a method for the unattended gray-box identification of sensor
models commonly used by localization algorithms in the field of robotics. The
objective is to determine the most likely sensor model for a time series of
unknown measurement data, given an extendable catalog of predefined sensor
models. Sensor model definitions may require states for rigid-body calibrations
and dedicated reference frames to replicate a measurement based on the robot's
localization state. A health metric is introduced, which verifies the outcome
of the selection process in order to detect false positives and facilitate
reliable decision-making. In a second stage, an initial guess for identified
calibration states is generated, and the necessity of sensor world reference
frames is evaluated. The identified sensor model with its parameter information
is then used to parameterize and initialize a state estimation application,
thus ensuring a more accurate and robust integration of new sensor elements.
This method is helpful for inexperienced users who want to identify the source
and type of a measurement, sensor calibrations, or sensor reference frames. It
will also be important in the field of modular multi-agent scenarios and
modularized robotic platforms that are augmented by sensor modalities during
runtime. Overall, this work aims to provide a simplified integration of sensor
modalities to downstream applications and circumvent common pitfalls in the
usage and development of localization approaches.

developed to handle parameter uncertainties robustly with high efficiency
ensured. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the utility of the
proposed methods in reducing battery degradation while satisfying task

Abstract: While robotic automation has demonstrated remarkable performance, such as
executing hundreds of experiments continuously over several days, it is
challenging to design a program that synchronizes the robot's movements with
the experimental jigs to conduct an experiment. We propose a concept that
enables the automation of experiments by utilizing dual demonstrations of robot
motions and jig operations by chemists in an experimental environment
constructed to be controlled by a robot. To verify this concept, we developed a
chemical-experiment-automation system consisting of jigs to assist the robot in
experiments, a motion-demonstration interface, a jig-control interface, and a
mobile manipulator. We validate the concept through polymer-synthesis
experiments, focusing on critical liquid-handling tasks such as pipetting and
dilution. The experimental results indicate high reproducibility of the
demonstrated motions and robust task-success rates. This comprehensive concept
not only simplifies the robot programming process for chemists but also
provides a flexible and efficient solution to accommodate a wide range of
experimental conditions, contributing significantly to the field of chemical
experiment automation.

### [8] [Control Architecture and Design for a Multi-robotic Visual Servoing System in Automated Manufacturing Environment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11387)
*Rongfei Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多机器人控制系统和相机移动策略在减少制造不确定性中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在微尺度制造中仍优于机器人，但通过多机器人控制系统和优化相机位置可以减少不确定性。

Method: 提出模拟紧固/松开过程的多机器人控制系统，并设计相机移动策略以最小化图像噪声。

Result: 多机器人控制系统显著减少不确定性，相机移动策略找到噪声最小的最优位置。

Conclusion: 多机器人控制和相机位置优化是减少制造不确定性的有效方法。

Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in
the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform
machines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires
high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for
high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment.
Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement
noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although
advanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are
utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic
errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a
comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated
manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that
simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications
can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great
extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on
developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few
have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In
a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary
significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects
of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image
shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel
algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera
workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is
minimized.

Motivation: 解决不同形态机器人间观察/动作维度与系统动力学差异导致的泛化难题。

Method: 使用形态无关的扩散模型捕捉跨形态运动模式，结合轻量级残差策略优化动作。

Result: 在仿真与真实实验中，相比标准PPO框架，平均回报提升10.35%。

Conclusion: 跨形态数据与生成架构能有效学习鲁棒、泛化的运动技能。

Abstract: Generalizing locomotion policies across diverse legged robots with varying
morphologies is a key challenge due to differences in observation/action
dimensions and system dynamics. In this work, we propose Multi-Loco, a novel
unified framework combining a morphology-agnostic generative diffusion model
with a lightweight residual policy optimized via reinforcement learning (RL).
The diffusion model captures morphology-invariant locomotion patterns from
diverse cross-embodiment datasets, improving generalization and robustness. The
residual policy is shared across all embodiments and refines the actions
generated by the diffusion model, enhancing task-aware performance and
robustness for real-world deployment. We evaluated our method with a rich
library of four legged robots in both simulation and real-world experiments.
Compared to a standard RL framework with PPO, our approach -- replacing the
Gaussian policy with a diffusion model and residual term -- achieves a 10.35%
average return improvement, with gains up to 13.57% in wheeled-biped locomotion
tasks. These results highlight the benefits of cross-embodiment data and
composite generative architectures in learning robust, generalized locomotion
skills.

Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on
handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and
scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and
validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation
relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven
synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical
cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new
generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process
heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control
actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving
scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of
foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous
driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes
large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language
models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of
autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies,
open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we
examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and
analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and
research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All
reviewed papers are listed in a continuously maintained repository, which

Result: 实验验证了夹持器的负载能力、抓取力、稳定性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该夹持器具有高通用性和鲁棒性，适用于多种抓取任务。

Abstract: We present a novel under-actuated gripper with two 3-joint fingers, which
realizes force feedback control by the deep learning technique- Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model, without any force sensor. First, a five-linkage mechanism
stacked by double four-linkages is designed as a finger to automatically
achieve the transformation between parallel and enveloping grasping modes. This
enables the creation of a low-cost under-actuated gripper comprising a single
actuator and two 3-phalange fingers. Second, we devise theoretical models of
kinematics and power transmission based on the proposed gripper, accurately
obtaining fingertip positions and contact forces. Through coupling and
decoupling of five-linkage mechanisms, the proposed gripper offers the expected
capabilities of grasping payload/force/stability and objects with large
dimension ranges. Third, to realize the force control, an LSTM model is
proposed to determine the grasping mode for synthesizing force-feedback control
policies that exploit contact sensing after outlining the uncertainty of
currents using a statistical method. Finally, a series of experiments are
implemented to measure quantitative indicators, such as the payload, grasping
force, force sensing, grasping stability and the dimension ranges of objects to
be grasped. Additionally, the grasping performance of the proposed gripper is
verified experimentally to guarantee the high versatility and robustness of the
proposed gripper.

Abstract: The collaboration and interaction of multiple robots have become integral
aspects of smart manufacturing. Effective planning and management play a
crucial role in achieving energy savings and minimising overall costs. This
paper addresses the real-time Dynamic Multiple Sources to Single Destination
(DMS-SD) navigation problem, particularly with a material distribution case for
multiple intelligent robots in smart manufacturing. Enumerated solutions, such
as in \cite{xiao2022efficient}, tackle the problem by generating as many
optimal or near-optimal solutions as possible but do not learn patterns from
the previous experience, whereas the method in \cite{xiao2023collaborative}
only uses limited information from the earlier trajectories. Consequently,
these methods may take a considerable amount of time to compute results on
large maps, rendering real-time operations impractical. To overcome this
challenge, we propose a lightweight Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to
address the DMS-SD problem. The proposed DRL method can be efficiently trained
and rapidly converges to the optimal solution using the designed target-guided
reward function. A well-trained DRL model significantly reduces the computation
time for the next movement to a millisecond level, which improves the time up
to 100 times in our experiments compared to the enumerated solutions. Moreover,
the trained DRL model can be easily deployed on lightweight devices in smart
manufacturing, such as Internet of Things devices and mobile phones, which only
require limited computational resources.

Conclusion: 研究为循环智能与机器人（CIRO）领域奠定基础，公开了源代码。

Abstract: The competition over natural reserves of minerals is expected to increase in
part because of the linear-economy paradigm based on take-make-dispose.
Simultaneously, the linear economy considers end-of-use products as waste
rather than as a resource, which results in large volumes of waste whose
management remains an unsolved problem. Since a transition to a circular
economy can mitigate these open issues, in this paper we begin by enhancing the
notion of circularity based on compartmental dynamical thermodynamics, namely,
$\lambda$, and then, we model a thermodynamical material network processing a
batch of 2 solid materials of criticality coefficients of 0.1 and 0.95, with a
robotic disassembler compartment controlled via reinforcement learning (RL),
and processing 2-7 kg of materials. Subsequently, we focused on the design of
the robotic disassembler compartment using state-of-the-art RL algorithms and
assessing the algorithm performance with respect to $\lambda$ (Fig. 1). The
highest circularity is -2.1 achieved in the case of disassembling 2 parts of 1
kg each, whereas it reduces to -7.2 in the case of disassembling 4 parts of 1
kg each contained inside a chassis of 3 kg. Finally, a sensitivity analysis
highlighted that the impact on $\lambda$ of the performance of an RL controller
has a positive correlation with the quantity and the criticality of the
materials to be disassembled. This work also gives the principles of the
emerging research fields indicated as circular intelligence and robotics
(CIRO). Source code is publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advancements in teleoperation systems have enabled high-quality data
collection for robotic manipulators, showing impressive results in learning
manipulation at scale. This progress suggests that extending these capabilities
to robotic hands could unlock an even broader range of manipulation skills,
especially if we could achieve the same level of dexterity that human hands
exhibit. However, teleoperating robotic hands is far from a solved problem, as
it presents a significant challenge due to the high degrees of freedom of
robotic hands and the complex dynamics occurring during contact-rich settings.
In this work, we present ExoStart, a general and scalable learning framework
that leverages human dexterity to improve robotic hand control. In particular,
we obtain high-quality data by collecting direct demonstrations without a robot
in the loop using a sensorized low-cost wearable exoskeleton, capturing the
rich behaviors that humans can demonstrate with their own hands. We also
propose a simulation-based dynamics filter that generates dynamically feasible
trajectories from the collected demonstrations and use the generated
trajectories to bootstrap an auto-curriculum reinforcement learning method that
relies only on simple sparse rewards. The ExoStart pipeline is generalizable
and yields robust policies that transfer zero-shot to the real robot. Our
results demonstrate that ExoStart can generate dexterous real-world hand
skills, achieving a success rate above 50% on a wide range of complex tasks
such as opening an AirPods case or inserting and turning a key in a lock. More

TL;DR: RoboPatient是一种医疗机器人模拟器，通过触觉和听觉反馈模拟疼痛表达，用于训练临床医生以减少误诊。研究表明，音高和振幅是感知疼痛声音的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 误诊可能导致治疗延误和伤害，RoboPatient旨在通过模拟罕见或复杂病例来训练和评估临床医生，减少诊断错误。

Method: RoboPatient基于触觉和听觉反馈模拟疼痛表达，通过腹部模型捕获和处理触觉输入，并使用内部映射模型生成疼痛反馈。研究通过7680次试验评估了参与者对疼痛声音的感知。

Result: 研究表明，音高和振幅显著影响对机器人疼痛表达的认同感，更强的触觉力引发更强的认同，音高是最具影响力的线索。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床教育和诊断模拟中的高保真机器人患者奠定了基础。

Abstract: Misdiagnosis can lead to delayed treatments and harm. Robotic patients offer
a controlled way to train and evaluate clinicians in rare, subtle, or complex
cases, reducing diagnostic errors. We present RoboPatient, a medical robotic
simulator aimed at multimodal pain synthesis based on haptic and auditory
feedback during palpation-based training scenarios. The robopatient functions
as an adaptive intermediary, capable of synthesizing plausible pain expressions
vocal and facial in response to tactile stimuli generated during palpation.
Using an abdominal phantom, robopatient captures and processes haptic input via
an internal palpation-to-pain mapping model. To evaluate perceptual congruence
between palpation and the corresponding auditory output, we conducted a study
involving 7680 trials across 20 participants, where they evaluated pain
intensity through sound. Results show that amplitude and pitch significantly
influence agreement with the robot's pain expressions, irrespective of pain
sounds. Stronger palpation forces elicited stronger agreement, aligning with
psychophysical patterns. The study revealed two key dimensions: pitch and
amplitude are central to how people perceive pain sounds, with pitch being the
most influential cue. These acoustic features shape how well the sound matches
the applied force during palpation, impacting perceived realism. This approach
lays the groundwork for high-fidelity robotic patients in clinical education
and diagnostic simulation.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PACE-ADS是一个基于心理学和认知的自动驾驶框架，通过三个智能体（Driver Agent、Psychologist Agent、Coordinator Agent）实现车辆与乘员的双向交互，提升舒适度和信任感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶车辆缺乏与乘员的有效双向交互，限制了个人化和故障恢复能力，影响了舒适度和信任感，阻碍了AV的广泛采用。

Method: PACE-ADS由三个基于基础模型的智能体组成，分别分析驾驶环境、解读乘员心理信号和认知指令，并整合输入以生成行为决策。

Result: 在模拟测试中，PACE-ADS能根据乘员状态调整驾驶风格，提升舒适度，并通过自主推理或人工指导安全恢复。

Conclusion: PACE-ADS展示了基于LLM的框架在弥合机器自主性与以人为本驾驶之间差距的潜力。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in autonomous driving, current autonomous vehicles
(AVs) lack effective bidirectional communication with occupants, limiting
personalization and recovery from immobilization. This reduces comfort and
trust, potentially slowing broader AV adoption. We propose PACE-ADS (Psychology
and Cognition Enabled Automated Driving Systems), a human-centered autonomy
framework that enables AVs to sense, interpret, and respond to both external
traffic and internal occupant states. PACE-ADS comprises three foundation
model-based agents: a Driver Agent that analyzes the driving context, a
Psychologist Agent that interprets occupant psychological signals (e.g., EEG,
heart rate, facial expressions) and cognitive commands (e.g., speech), and a
Coordinator Agent that integrates these inputs to produce high-level behavior
decisions and operational parameters. Rather than replacing existing AV
modules, PACE-ADS complements them by operating at the behavioral level,
delegating low-level control to native AV systems. This separation enables
closed-loop adaptation and supports integration across diverse platforms. We
evaluate PACE-ADS in simulation across varied scenarios involving traffic
lights, pedestrians, work zones, and car following. Results show that PACE-ADS
adapts driving styles to occupant states, improves ride comfort, and enables
safe recovery from immobilization via autonomous reasoning or human guidance.
Our findings highlight the promise of LLM-based frameworks for bridging the gap
between machine autonomy and human-centered driving.

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种基于强化学习的机器人患者系统，通过动态生成听觉疼痛反馈来改进腹部触诊训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 诊断错误是可预防死亡的主要原因，尤其在资源有限的地区。医疗模拟器（如机器人患者）在减少这些错误中起关键作用，但多模态反馈（尤其是疼痛声音）的生成仍具挑战性。

Method: 使用近端策略优化（PPO）强化学习技术，机器人根据实时人类反馈动态调整疼痛声音，以匹配触诊力和人类偏好。

Result: 系统能够适应个体的触诊力和声音偏好，并通过强化学习探索广泛的疼痛强度范围。研究还发现疼痛声音感知在低力下存在饱和现象，且具有性别特异性阈值。

Conclusion: 该系统为腹部触诊训练提供了一个可控且沉浸式的模拟平台，具有显著的应用潜力。

Abstract: Diagnostic errors remain a major cause of preventable deaths, particularly in
resource-limited regions. Medical training simulators, including robopatients,
play a vital role in reducing these errors by mimicking real patients for
procedural training such as palpation. However, generating multimodal feedback,
especially auditory pain expressions, remains challenging due to the complex
relationship between palpation behavior and sound. The high-dimensional nature
of pain sounds makes exploration challenging with conventional methods. This
study introduces a novel experimental paradigm for pain expressivity in
robopatients where they dynamically generate auditory pain expressions in
response to palpation force, by co-optimizing human feedback using machine
learning. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning
(RL) technique optimized for continuous adaptation, our robot iteratively
refines pain sounds based on real-time human feedback. This robot initializes
randomized pain responses to palpation forces, and the RL agent learns to
adjust these sounds to align with human preferences. The results demonstrated
that the system adapts to an individual's palpation forces and sound
preferences and captures a broad spectrum of pain intensity, from mild
discomfort to acute distress, through RL-guided exploration of the auditory
pain space. The study further showed that pain sound perception exhibits
saturation at lower forces with gender specific thresholds. These findings
highlight the system's potential to enhance abdominal palpation training by
offering a controllable and immersive simulation platform.

high-quality data collection across diverse tasks such as pick and place, item
sorting and assembly insertion. Leveraging high-frequency generative control,
we train end-to-end policies from raw sensory inputs, enabling smooth,
self-correcting motions in complex manipulation scenarios. Real-world
evaluations demonstrate up to 93.3% out of distribution success rates, with up
to a +33.3% performance boost due to emergent self-correcting behaviors, while
also revealing scaling trends in policy performance. Our results advance the

Motivation: 现有模仿学习策略受限于演示速度，无法满足工业自动化等高吞吐需求。

Method: SAIL系统整合了动作推断、高保真跟踪、自适应速度调节和动作调度四个组件。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人平台上，SAIL实现了最高4倍和3.2倍的速度提升。

Conclusion: SAIL为高速执行任务提供了可行方案，解决了模仿学习中的速度限制问题。

Abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning are
effective at acquiring complex robotic manipulation skills. However, existing
IL-trained policies are confined to executing the task at the same speed as
shown in demonstration data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic
system, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation.
In this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling
faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify
fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts.
We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation
Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components:
(1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at
high speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets,
(3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on
motion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system
latencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct
robot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration
speed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world. Additional detail

Abstract: Estimating the 3D hand articulation from a single color image is a
continuously investigated problem with applications in Augmented Reality (AR),
Virtual Reality (VR), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and robotics. Apart
from the absence of depth information, occlusions, articulation complexity, and
the need for camera parameters knowledge pose additional challenges. In this
work, we propose an optimization pipeline for estimating the 3D hand
articulation from 2D keypoint input, which includes a keypoint alignment step
and a fingertip loss to overcome the need to know or estimate the camera
parameters. We evaluate our approach on the EgoDexter and Dexter+Object
benchmarks to showcase that our approach performs competitively with the SotA,
while also demonstrating its robustness when processing "in-the-wild" images
without any prior camera knowledge. Our quantitative analysis highlights the
sensitivity of the 2D keypoint estimation accuracy, despite the use of hand

Conclusion: 该框架在图像质量受限的场景中提供了更鲁棒和可靠的目标检测方案。

Abstract: In this study, proposes a method for improved object detection from the
low-resolution images by integrating Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative
Adversarial Networks (ESRGAN) and Faster Region-Convolutional Neural Network
(Faster R-CNN). ESRGAN enhances low-quality images, restoring details and
improving clarity, while Faster R-CNN performs accurate object detection on the
enhanced images. The combination of these techniques ensures better detection
performance, even with poor-quality inputs, offering an effective solution for
applications where image resolution is in consistent. ESRGAN is employed as a
pre-processing step to enhance the low-resolution input image, effectively
restoring lost details and improving overall image quality. Subsequently, the
enhanced image is fed into the Faster R-CNN model for accurate object detection
and localization. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated
approach yields superior performance compared to traditional methods applied
directly to low-resolution images. The proposed framework provides a promising
solution for applications where image quality is variable or limited, enabling
more robust and reliable object detection in challenging scenarios. It achieves
a balance between improved image quality and efficient object detection

Conclusion: 改进方法显著提升了场景挖掘的可靠性和精度。

Abstract: Scenario mining from extensive autonomous driving datasets, such as Argoverse
2, is crucial for the development and validation of self-driving systems. The
RefAV framework represents a promising approach by employing Large Language
Models (LLMs) to translate natural-language queries into executable code for
identifying relevant scenarios. However, this method faces challenges,
including runtime errors stemming from LLM-generated code and inaccuracies in
interpreting parameters for functions that describe complex multi-object
spatial relationships. This technical report introduces two key enhancements to
address these limitations: (1) a fault-tolerant iterative code-generation
mechanism that refines code by re-prompting the LLM with error feedback, and
(2) specialized prompt engineering that improves the LLM's comprehension and
correct application of spatial-relationship functions. Experiments on the
Argoverse 2 validation set with diverse LLMs-Qwen2.5-VL-7B, Gemini 2.5 Flash,
and Gemini 2.5 Pro-show consistent gains across multiple metrics; most notably,
the proposed system achieves a HOTA-Temporal score of 52.37 on the official

Abstract: Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems leveraging Large Language Models
(LLMs) exhibit significant potential for complex reasoning, planning, and tool

This involved extending SimpleMind (SM), an open-source Cognitive AI
environment with configurable tools for medical image analysis, with an
LLM-based agent, implemented using OpenManus, to automate the planning (tool

proof-of-concept demonstration that an agentic system can interpret a computer

Motivation: 传统算法（如ViT、Mask R-CNN等）在铁矿石颗粒分类和尺寸测量中效果不佳，需开发更精确的方法。

Method: 采用StarDist算法进行对象分割、轮廓确定和分类，改进物理尺寸测量和颗粒分布分析。

Result: 新方法显著提高了颗粒边界平滑度和尺寸测量精度，优化了质量分类。

Conclusion: StarDist算法为铁矿石颗粒分类和测量提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We would like to present a comprehensive study on the classification of iron
ore pellets, aimed at identifying quality violations in the final product,
alongside the development of an innovative imagebased measurement method
utilizing the StarDist algorithm, which is primarily employed in the medical
field. This initiative is motivated by the necessity to accurately identify and
analyze objects within densely packed and unstable environments. The process
involves segmenting these objects, determining their contours, classifying
them, and measuring their physical dimensions. This is crucial because the size
distribution and classification of pellets such as distinguishing between nice
(quality) and joint (caused by the presence of moisture or indicating a process
of production failure) types are among the most significant characteristics
that define the quality of the final product. Traditional algorithms, including
image classification techniques using Vision Transformer (ViT), instance
segmentation methods like Mask R-CNN, and various anomaly segmentation
algorithms, have not yielded satisfactory results in this context.
Consequently, we explored methodologies from related fields to enhance our
approach. The outcome of our research is a novel method designed to detect
objects with smoothed boundaries. This advancement significantly improves the
accuracy of physical dimension measurements and facilitates a more precise
analysis of size distribution among the iron ore pellets. By leveraging the
strengths of the StarDist algorithm, we aim to provide a robust solution that
addresses the challenges posed by the complex nature of pellet classification
and measurement.

Conclusion: STT是一种高效且实用的图像分割工具，适用于增强现实和机器人应用。

Abstract: This paper presents Segment This Thing (STT), a new efficient image
segmentation model designed to produce a single segment given a single point
prompt. Instead of following prior work and increasing efficiency by decreasing
model size, we gain efficiency by foveating input images. Given an image and a
point prompt, we extract a crop centered on the prompt and apply a novel
variable-resolution patch tokenization in which patches are downsampled at a
rate that increases with increased distance from the prompt. This approach
yields far fewer image tokens than uniform patch tokenization. As a result we
can drastically reduce the computational cost of segmentation without reducing
model size. Furthermore, the foveation focuses the model on the region of
interest, a potentially useful inductive bias. We show that our Segment This
Thing model is more efficient than prior work while remaining competitive on
segmentation benchmarks. It can easily run at interactive frame rates on
consumer hardware and is thus a promising tool for augmented reality or
robotics applications.

Result: 实验显示，BrainMAP在计算效率上优于现有方法，且预测准确性未受影响。

Conclusion: BrainMAP为神经退行性疾病的精确诊断提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in research focused on leveraging graph
learning techniques to detect neurodegenerative diseases. However, existing
graph-based approaches typically lack the ability to localize and extract the
specific brain regions driving neurodegenerative pathology within the full
connectome. Additionally, recent works on multimodal brain graph models often
suffer from high computational complexity, limiting their practical use in
resource-constrained devices. In this study, we present BrainMAP, a novel
multimodal graph learning framework designed for precise and computationally
efficient identification of brain regions affected by neurodegenerative
diseases. First, BrainMAP utilizes an atlas-driven filtering approach guided by
the AAL atlas to pinpoint and extract critical brain subgraphs. Unlike recent
state-of-the-art methods, which model the entire brain network, BrainMAP
achieves more than 50% reduction in computational overhead by concentrating on
disease-relevant subgraphs. Second, we employ an advanced multimodal fusion
process comprising cross-node attention to align functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data, coupled with an
adaptive gating mechanism to blend and integrate these modalities dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that BrainMAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in computational efficiency, without compromising predictive accuracy.

Abstract: Automated pain detection through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL)
algorithms holds significant potential in healthcare, particularly for patients
unable to self-report pain levels. However, the accuracy and fairness of these
algorithms across different demographic groups (e.g., gender) remain
under-researched. This paper investigates the gender fairness of ML and DL
models trained on the UNBC-McMaster Shoulder Pain Expression Archive Database,
evaluating the performance of various models in detecting pain based solely on
the visual modality of participants' facial expressions. We compare traditional
ML algorithms, Linear Support Vector Machine (L SVM) and Radial Basis Function
SVM (RBF SVM), with DL methods, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT), using a range of performance and fairness metrics. While ViT
achieved the highest accuracy and a selection of fairness metrics, all models
exhibited gender-based biases. These findings highlight the persistent
trade-off between accuracy and fairness, emphasising the need for
fairness-aware techniques to mitigate biases in automated healthcare systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的损失函数ContextLoss（CLoss），通过考虑拓扑错误的完整上下文，提高了图像分割中拓扑结构的正确性，并在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在图像分割中，保持分割结构（如血管、膜或道路）的拓扑结构至关重要，拓扑错误可能严重影响实际应用（如导航）。现有方法基于关键像素掩码，但未充分利用上下文信息。

Method: 提出CLoss损失函数，通过考虑拓扑错误的完整上下文，改进网络对拓扑错误的关注。同时提出两种直观的指标，验证连接性的改善。

Result: 在三个公共数据集和自有的3D纳米成像数据集上验证，CLoss在拓扑感知指标上表现更优，修复了比其他方法多44%的缺失连接。

Conclusion: CLoss显著提升了拓扑正确性，代码已公开。

Abstract: In image segmentation, preserving the topology of segmented structures like
vessels, membranes, or roads is crucial. For instance, topological errors on
road networks can significantly impact navigation. Recently proposed solutions
are loss functions based on critical pixel masks that consider the whole
skeleton of the segmented structures in the critical pixel mask. We propose the
novel loss function ContextLoss (CLoss) that improves topological correctness
by considering topological errors with their whole context in the critical
pixel mask. The additional context improves the network focus on the
topological errors. Further, we propose two intuitive metrics to verify
improved connectivity due to a closing of missed connections. We benchmark our
proposed CLoss on three public datasets (2D & 3D) and our own 3D nano-imaging
dataset of bone cement lines. Training with our proposed CLoss increases
performance on topology-aware metrics and repairs up to 44% more missed
connections than other state-of-the-art methods. We make the code publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JAFAR是一种轻量级且灵活的特征上采样器，通过注意力模块提升视觉特征的空间分辨率，无需高分辨率监督即可泛化到更高输出尺度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础视觉编码器的低分辨率特征输出需要上采样以满足下游任务的高分辨率需求。

Method: JAFAR采用基于注意力的模块，结合空间特征变换（SFT）调制，实现低分辨率特征到任意目标分辨率的上采样。

Result: 实验表明，JAFAR能有效恢复细粒度空间细节，并在多种下游任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: JAFAR为视觉特征上采样提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation Vision Encoders have become essential for a wide range of dense
vision tasks. However, their low-resolution spatial feature outputs necessitate
feature upsampling to produce the high-resolution modalities required for
downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce JAFAR, a lightweight and flexible
feature upsampler that enhances the spatial resolution of visual features from
any Foundation Vision Encoder to an arbitrary target resolution. JAFAR employs
an attention-based module designed to promote semantic alignment between
high-resolution queries, derived from low-level image features, and
semantically enriched low-resolution keys, using Spatial Feature Transform
(SFT) modulation. Notably, despite the absence of high-resolution supervision,
we demonstrate that learning at low upsampling ratios and resolutions
generalizes remarkably well to significantly higher output scales. Extensive
experiments show that JAFAR effectively recovers fine-grained spatial details
and consistently outperforms existing feature upsampling methods across a
diverse set of downstream tasks. Project page at

Result: 在基准测试中表现优于现有方法，显著提升了对少数类和模糊区域的分割效果。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将不确定性转化为学习资源，有效提升了半监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) faces persistent challenges in
effectively leveraging unlabeled data, such as ineffective utilization of
pseudo-labels, exacerbation of class imbalance biases, and neglect of
prediction uncertainty. Current approaches often discard uncertain regions
through strict thresholding favouring dominant classes. To address these
limitations, we introduce a holistic framework that transforms uncertainty into
a learning asset through four principal components: (1) fuzzy pseudo-labeling,
which preserves soft class distributions from top-K predictions to enrich
supervision; (2) uncertainty-aware dynamic weighting, that modulate pixel-wise
contributions via entropy-based reliability scores; (3) adaptive class
rebalancing, which dynamically adjust losses to counteract long-tailed class
distributions; and (4) lightweight contrastive regularization, that encourage
compact and discriminative feature embeddings. Extensive experiments on
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving significant improvements in the segmentation of
under-represented classes and ambiguous regions.

does not assign performance ratings, it provides an objective snapshot of
in-class interactions, helping teachers recognize and improve their
instructional strategies. Designed and tested in an Asian educational context,
this work also contributes a culturally grounded methodology to the growing
field of AI-based educational analytics.

Method: 结合偏好优化和分治策略，提出时间步分段偏好优化（TPO）和两个专用LoRA模块。

Conclusion: AlignHuman通过时间步分段优化和专家模块，高效平衡了运动自然性和视觉保真度。

Abstract: Recent advancements in human video generation and animation tasks, driven by
diffusion models, have achieved significant progress. However, expressive and
realistic human animation remains challenging due to the trade-off between
motion naturalness and visual fidelity. To address this, we propose
\textbf{AlignHuman}, a framework that combines Preference Optimization as a
post-training technique with a divide-and-conquer training strategy to jointly
optimize these competing objectives. Our key insight stems from an analysis of
the denoising process across timesteps: (1) early denoising timesteps primarily
control motion dynamics, while (2) fidelity and human structure can be
effectively managed by later timesteps, even if early steps are skipped.
Building on this observation, we propose timestep-segment preference
optimization (TPO) and introduce two specialized LoRAs as expert alignment
modules, each targeting a specific dimension in its corresponding timestep
interval. The LoRAs are trained using their respective preference data and
activated in the corresponding intervals during inference to enhance motion
naturalness and fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AlignHuman
improves strong baselines and reduces NFEs during inference, achieving a
3.3$\times$ speedup (from 100 NFEs to 30 NFEs) with minimal impact on
generation quality. Homepage:

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) holds significant potential for
clinical decision support, yet existing efforts primarily focus on 2D imaging
with limited task diversity. This paper presents 3D-RAD, a large-scale dataset
designed to advance 3D Med-VQA using radiology CT scans. The 3D-RAD dataset
encompasses six diverse VQA tasks: anomaly detection, image observation,
medical computation, existence detection, static temporal diagnosis, and
longitudinal temporal diagnosis. It supports both open- and closed-ended
questions while introducing complex reasoning challenges, including
computational tasks and multi-stage temporal analysis, to enable comprehensive
benchmarking. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that existing vision-language
models (VLMs), especially medical VLMs exhibit limited generalization,
particularly in multi-temporal tasks, underscoring the challenges of real-world
3D diagnostic reasoning. To drive future advancements, we release a
high-quality training set 3D-RAD-T of 136,195 expert-aligned samples, showing
that fine-tuning on this dataset could significantly enhance model performance.

Conclusion: LLM-to-Phy3D在物理AI领域具有广泛应用潜力，为科学和工程生成设计提供新工具。

Abstract: The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) and large
language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the landscape of digital content
creation in different modalities. However, its potential use in Physical AI for
engineering design, where the production of physically viable artifacts is
paramount, remains vastly underexplored. The absence of physical knowledge in
existing LLM-to-3D models often results in outputs detached from real-world
physical constraints. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-to-Phy3D, a
physically conform online 3D object generation that enables existing LLM-to-3D
models to produce physically conforming 3D objects on the fly. LLM-to-Phy3D
introduces a novel online black-box refinement loop that empowers large
language models (LLMs) through synergistic visual and physics-based
evaluations. By delivering directional feedback in an iterative refinement
process, LLM-to-Phy3D actively drives the discovery of prompts that yield 3D
artifacts with enhanced physical performance and greater geometric novelty
relative to reference objects, marking a substantial contribution to AI-driven
generative design. Systematic evaluations of LLM-to-Phy3D, supported by
ablation studies in vehicle design optimization, reveal various LLM
improvements gained by 4.5% to 106.7% in producing physically conform target
domain 3D designs over conventional LLM-to-3D models. The encouraging results
suggest the potential general use of LLM-to-Phy3D in Physical AI for scientific

Motivation: 解决在无标注数据情况下从EEG数据中恢复心理目标的问题，此前研究依赖标注数据。

Method: 提出CURSOR算法，通过自校准学习恢复未知心理目标，无需标注数据或预训练解码器。

Result: CURSOR能预测与人类感知判断相关的图像相似度分数，并生成与心理目标无法区分的新刺激。

Conclusion: CURSOR在无标注数据情况下有效恢复心理目标，为脑机接口研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a mental target (e.g., an image of a
face) that a participant has in mind from paired EEG (i.e., brain responses)
and image (i.e., perceived faces) data collected during interactive sessions
without access to labeled information. The problem has been previously explored
with labeled data but not via self-calibration, where labeled data is
unavailable. Here, we present the first framework and an algorithm, CURSOR,
that learns to recover unknown mental targets without access to labeled data or
pre-trained decoders. Our experiments on naturalistic images of faces
demonstrate that CURSOR can (1) predict image similarity scores that correlate
with human perceptual judgments without any label information, (2) use these
scores to rank stimuli against an unknown mental target, and (3) generate new
stimuli indistinguishable from the unknown mental target (validated via a user
study, N=53).

Motivation: 智能家居HAR系统因缺乏大规模、多样化标注数据而难以泛化，用户行为和家庭布局的多样性加剧了这一挑战。

Method: 通过AgentSense生成虚拟人物及其日常行为，在扩展的VirtualHome环境中模拟并记录传感器数据。

Result: 虚拟数据显著提升了HAR性能，尤其在真实数据有限时，结合少量真实数据即可达到与完整真实数据集相当的效果。

Conclusion: 虚拟数据为解决环境感知中缺乏大规模标注数据的挑战提供了有效途径。

Abstract: A major obstacle in developing robust and generalizable smart home-based
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems is the lack of large-scale, diverse
labeled datasets. Variability in home layouts, sensor configurations, and user
behavior adds further complexity, as individuals follow varied routines and
perform activities in distinct ways. Building HAR systems that generalize well
requires training data that captures the diversity across users and
environments. To address these challenges, we introduce AgentSense, a virtual
data generation pipeline where diverse personas are generated by leveraging
Large Language Models. These personas are used to create daily routines, which
are then decomposed into low-level action sequences. Subsequently, the actions
are executed in a simulated home environment called VirtualHome that we
extended with virtual ambient sensors capable of recording the agents
activities as they unfold. Overall, AgentSense enables the generation of rich,
virtual sensor datasets that represent a wide range of users and home settings.
Across five benchmark HAR datasets, we show that leveraging our virtual sensor
data substantially improves performance, particularly when real data are
limited. Notably, models trained on a combination of virtual data and just a
few days of real data achieve performance comparable to those trained on the
entire real datasets. These results demonstrate and prove the potential of
virtual data to address one of the most pressing challenges in ambient sensing,
which is the distinct lack of large-scale, annotated datasets without requiring
any manual data collection efforts.

Conclusion: 实验验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，为旋转估计提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot
tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for
safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a
non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design.
However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a
rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model
fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any
singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion,
revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere
surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method
to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional
robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics
processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of
GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for
large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation
estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical
framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct
controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments
provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our
approach in solving rotation estimation problems.

Conclusion: AutoCaption能有效全面评估MLLMs的视频字幕能力，并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Video captioning can be used to assess the video understanding capabilities
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing benchmarks and
evaluation protocols suffer from crucial issues, such as inadequate or
homogeneous creation of key points, exorbitant cost of data creation, and
limited evaluation scopes. To address these issues, we propose an automatic
framework, named AutoCaption, which leverages Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to
construct numerous and diverse descriptive sentences (\textit{i.e.}, key
points) that thoroughly represent video content in an iterative way. This
iterative captioning strategy enables the continuous enhancement of video
details such as actions, objects' attributes, environment details, etc. We
apply AutoCaption to curate MCTS-VCB, a fine-grained video caption benchmark
covering video details, thereby enabling a comprehensive evaluation of MLLMs on
the video captioning task. We evaluate more than 20 open- and closed-source
MLLMs of varying sizes on MCTS-VCB. Results show that MCTS-VCB can effectively
and comprehensively evaluate the video captioning capability, with
Gemini-1.5-Pro achieving the highest F1 score of 71.2. Interestingly, we
fine-tune InternVL2.5-8B with the AutoCaption-generated data, which helps the
model achieve an overall improvement of 25.0% on MCTS-VCB and 16.3% on
DREAM-1K, further demonstrating the effectiveness of AutoCaption. The code and
data are available at https://github.com/tjunlp-lab/MCTS-VCB.

ambiguities. A comparative analysis of different OCR tools is presented to
evaluate their effectiveness concerning accuracy, layout recognition, and
processing speed. The approach demonstrates significant improvements over
traditional rule-based and template-based methods, offering enhanced

Motivation: 理解人类社交行为（如情感识别和社交动态）是一个重要但具有挑战性的问题，现有LLMs局限于文本领域，无法捕捉非语言线索的作用。

Method: 提出视觉社交-语用推理任务，构建高质量数据集，并对多种VLMs进行性能测试。

Result: 发现VLMs在视觉社交-语用推理方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: VLMs在社交推理中仍有改进空间，需进一步研究以填补这一差距。

Abstract: Understanding human social behavior such as recognizing emotions and the
social dynamics causing them is an important and challenging problem. While
LLMs have made remarkable advances, they are limited to the textual domain and
cannot account for the major role that non-verbal cues play in understanding
social situations. Vision Language Models (VLMs) can potentially account for
this gap, however their ability to make correct inferences over such social
cues has received little attention. In this paper, we explore the capabilities
of VLMs at social reasoning. We identify a previously overlooked limitation in
VLMs: the Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference gap. To target this gap, we propose
a new task for VLMs: Visual Social-Pragmatic Inference. We construct a high
quality dataset to test the abilities of a VLM for this task and benchmark the
performance of several VLMs on it.

network (MobileNet-V3) with a recurrent structure (Long Short-Term Memory) to
predict gaze coordinates from grayscale facial images. Gaze data were collected
from 51 participants using dynamic visual stimuli, and accuracy was measured
using Euclidean distance. The deep learning model produced a mean error of
17.76 mm, compared to 16.53 mm for the Tobii Pro Nano. While overall accuracy
differences were small, the deep learning-based method was more sensitive to
factors such as lighting, vision correction, and age, with higher failure rates
observed under low-light conditions among participants using glasses and in
older age groups. Device-specific and positional factors also influenced
tracking performance. These results highlight the potential of appearance-based
approaches for mobile eye tracking and offer a reference framework for
evaluating gaze estimation systems across varied usage conditions.

Abstract: Visualizing the first few kilometers of the Earth's subsurface, a
long-standing challenge gating a virtually inexhaustible list of important
applications, is coming within reach through deep learning. Building on
techniques of generative artificial intelligence applied to voxelated images,
we demonstrate a method that extends surface geological data supplemented by
boreholes to a three-dimensional subsurface region by training a neural
network. The Earth's land area having been extensively mapped for geological
features, the bottleneck of this or any related technique is the availability
of data below the surface. We close this data gap in the development of
subsurface deep learning by designing a synthetic data-generator process that
mimics eons of geological activity such as sediment compaction, volcanic
intrusion, and tectonic dynamics to produce a virtually limitless number of
samples of the near lithosphere. A foundation model trained on such synthetic
data is able to generate a 3D image of the subsurface from a previously unseen
map of surface topography and geology, showing increasing fidelity with
increasing access to borehole data, depicting such structures as layers,
faults, folds, dikes, and sills. We illustrate the early promise of the
combination of a synthetic lithospheric generator with a trained neural network
model using generative flow matching. Ultimately, such models will be
fine-tuned on data from applicable campaigns, such as mineral prospecting in a
given region. Though useful in itself, a regionally fine-tuned models may be
employed not as an end but as a means: as an AI-based regularizer in a more
traditional inverse problem application, in which the objective function
represents the mismatch of additional data with physical models with
applications in resource exploration, hazard assessment, and geotechnical
engineering.

Abstract: This paper compares the performance of BiLSTM and CNN+GRU deep learning
models for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on two WiFi-based Channel State
Information (CSI) datasets: UT-HAR and NTU-Fi HAR. The findings indicate that
the CNN+GRU model has a higher accuracy on the UT-HAR dataset (95.20%) thanks

performs better on the high-resolution NTU-Fi HAR dataset (92.05%) by
extracting long-term temporal dependencies more effectively. The findings
strongly emphasize the critical role of dataset characteristics and

Abstract: As a cornerstone of patient care, clinical decision-making significantly
influences patient outcomes and can be enhanced by large language models
(LLMs). Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance, their
application to visual question answering in medical imaging, particularly for
reasoning-based diagnosis, remains largely unexplored. Furthermore, supervised
fine-tuning for reasoning tasks is largely impractical due to limited data
availability and high annotation costs. In this work, we introduce a zero-shot
framework for reliable medical image diagnosis that enhances the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs in clinical settings through test-time scaling. Given a
medical image and a textual prompt, a vision-language model processes a medical
image along with a corresponding textual prompt to generate multiple
descriptions or interpretations of visual features. These interpretations are
then fed to an LLM, where a test-time scaling strategy consolidates multiple
candidate outputs into a reliable final diagnosis. We evaluate our approach
across various medical imaging modalities -- including radiology,
ophthalmology, and histopathology -- and demonstrate that the proposed
test-time scaling strategy enhances diagnostic accuracy for both our and
baseline methods. Additionally, we provide an empirical analysis showing that
the proposed approach, which allows unbiased prompting in the first stage,
improves the reliability of LLM-generated diagnoses and enhances classification
accuracy.

Abstract: Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is essential for studying brain
function and diagnosing neurological disorders, but current analysis methods
face reproducibility and transferability issues due to complex pre-processing
and task-specific models. We introduce NeuroSTORM (Neuroimaging Foundation
Model with Spatial-Temporal Optimized Representation Modeling), a generalizable
framework that directly learns from 4D fMRI volumes and enables efficient
knowledge transfer across diverse applications. NeuroSTORM is pre-trained on
28.65 million fMRI frames (>9,000 hours) from over 50,000 subjects across
multiple centers and ages 5 to 100. Using a Mamba backbone and a shifted
scanning strategy, it efficiently processes full 4D volumes. We also propose a
spatial-temporal optimized pre-training approach and task-specific prompt
tuning to improve transferability. NeuroSTORM outperforms existing methods
across five tasks: age/gender prediction, phenotype prediction, disease
diagnosis, fMRI-to-image retrieval, and task-based fMRI classification. It
demonstrates strong clinical utility on datasets from hospitals in the U.S.,
South Korea, and Australia, achieving top performance in disease diagnosis and
cognitive phenotype prediction. NeuroSTORM provides a standardized, open-source
foundation model to improve reproducibility and transferability in fMRI-based
clinical research.

Abstract: Human-machine interaction, particularly in prosthetic and robotic control,
has seen progress with gesture recognition via surface electromyographic (sEMG)
signals.However, classifying similar gestures that produce nearly identical
muscle signals remains a challenge, often reducing classification accuracy.
Traditional deep learning models for sEMG gesture recognition are large and
computationally expensive, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained
embedded systems. In this work, we propose WaveFormer, a lightweight
transformer-based architecture tailored for sEMG gesture recognition. Our model
integrates time-domain and frequency-domain features through a novel learnable
wavelet transform, enhancing feature extraction. In particular, the WaveletConv
module, a multi-level wavelet decomposition layer with depthwise separable
convolution, ensures both efficiency and compactness. With just 3.1 million
parameters, WaveFormer achieves 95% classification accuracy on the EPN612
dataset, outperforming larger models. Furthermore, when profiled on a laptop
equipped with an Intel CPU, INT8 quantization achieves real-time deployment
with a 6.75 ms inference latency.

Motivation: 现有无监督领域自适应（UDA）方法主要基于自然图像或清晰无人机图像，对恶劣条件下的无人机图像研究较少，且现有方法在特征对齐和伪标签质量上表现不佳。

Method: 提出SF-TMAT框架，包括DSFMA（动态调整掩码比和特征重建）和VFST（动态调整伪标签阈值）策略。

Result: 实验表明SF-TMAT在恶劣场景下的无人机目标检测中表现优越且具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: SF-TMAT为恶劣条件下的无人机目标检测提供了有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has shown promise in effectively
alleviating the performance degradation caused by domain gaps between source
and target domains, and it can potentially be generalized to UAV object
detection in adverse scenes. However, existing UDA studies are based on natural
images or clear UAV imagery, and research focused on UAV imagery in adverse
conditions is still in its infancy. Moreover, due to the unique perspective of
UAVs and the interference from adverse conditions, these methods often fail to
accurately align features and are influenced by limited or noisy pseudo-labels.
To address this, we propose the first benchmark for UAV object detection in
adverse scenes, the Statistical Feedback-Driven Threshold and Mask Adjustment
Teacher-Student Framework (SF-TMAT). Specifically, SF-TMAT introduces a design
called Dynamic Step Feedback Mask Adjustment Autoencoder (DSFMA), which
dynamically adjusts the mask ratio and reconstructs feature maps by integrating
training progress and loss feedback. This approach dynamically adjusts the
learning focus at different training stages to meet the model's needs for
learning features at varying levels of granularity. Additionally, we propose a
unique Variance Feedback Smoothing Threshold (VFST) strategy, which
statistically computes the mean confidence of each class and dynamically
adjusts the selection threshold by incorporating a variance penalty term. This
strategy improves the quality of pseudo-labels and uncovers potentially valid
labels, thus mitigating domain bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority and generalization capability of the proposed SF-TMAT in UAV object
detection under adverse scene conditions. The Code is released at
https://github.com/ChenHuyoo .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加州车辆数量增加，但交通系统不足和测速摄像头稀疏，导致需要更有效的车辆速度检测方法，尤其是区分车道和车辆类型。

Method: 使用改进的YOLOv11模型，训练800张鸟瞰图，识别车辆车道并分类为轿车和重型车辆，同时评估无人机高度、ROI距离和车速对检测的影响。

Result: 改进的YOLOv11模型在MAE和MSE上表现优异（0.97 mph和0.94 mph²），验证了其在速度和分类任务中的高效性。

Conclusion: 该模型为交通监控提供了高精度的速度和分类检测方案，解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: The increase in vehicle numbers in California, driven by inadequate
transportation systems and sparse speed cameras, necessitates effective vehicle
speed detection. Detecting vehicle speeds per lane is critical for monitoring
High-Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lane speeds, distinguishing between cars and heavy
vehicles with differing speed limits, and enforcing lane restrictions for heavy
vehicles. While prior works utilized YOLO (You Only Look Once) for vehicle
speed detection, they often lacked accuracy, failed to identify vehicle lanes,
and offered limited or less practical classification categories. This study
introduces a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model, trained on almost 800 bird's-eye view
images, to enhance vehicle speed detection accuracy which is much higher
compare to the previous works. The proposed system identifies the lane for each
vehicle and classifies vehicles into two categories: cars and heavy vehicles.
Designed to meet the specific requirements of traffic monitoring and
regulation, the model also evaluates the effects of factors such as drone
height, distance of Region of Interest (ROI), and vehicle speed on detection
accuracy and speed measurement. Drone footage collected from Northern
California was used to assess the proposed system. The fine-tuned YOLOv11
achieved its best performance with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.97 mph and
mean squared error (MSE) of 0.94 $\text{mph}^2$, demonstrating its efficacy in
addressing challenges in vehicle speed detection and classification.

Result: 知识追踪遗忘能更灵活地满足各方需求，并更贴近认知科学中的遗忘机制。

Conclusion: 知识追踪机器遗忘是一种更实用且符合认知科学的范式，适用于基础模型的多样化遗忘需求。

Abstract: Machine unlearning removes certain training data points and their influence
on AI models (e.g., when a data owner revokes their decision to allow models to
learn from the data). In this position paper, we propose to lift data-tracing
machine unlearning to knowledge-tracing for foundation models (FMs). We support
this position based on practical needs and insights from cognitive studies.
Practically, tracing data cannot meet the diverse unlearning requests for FMs,
which may be from regulators, enterprise users, product teams, etc., having no
access to FMs' massive training data. Instead, it is convenient for these
parties to issue an unlearning request about the knowledge or capability FMs
(should not) possess. Cognitively, knowledge-tracing unlearning aligns with how
the human brain forgets more closely than tracing individual training data
points. Finally, we provide a concrete case study about a vision-language FM to
illustrate how an unlearner might instantiate the knowledge-tracing machine
unlearning paradigm.

Abstract: World models aim to simulate environments and enable effective agent

as they dynamically change across both space and, crucially, time. To capture
these composed dynamics, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal Road Image Dataset for
Exploration (STRIDE) permuting 360-degree panoramic imagery into rich
interconnected observation, state and action nodes. Leveraging this structure,
we can simultaneously model the relationship between egocentric views,
positional coordinates, and movement commands across both space and time. We
benchmark this dataset via TARDIS, a transformer-based generative world model
that integrates spatial and temporal dynamics through a unified autoregressive
framework trained on STRIDE. We demonstrate robust performance across a range
of agentic tasks such as controllable photorealistic image synthesis,
instruction following, autonomous self-control, and state-of-the-art
georeferencing. These results suggest a promising direction towards
sophisticated generalist agents--capable of understanding and manipulating the
spatial and temporal aspects of their material environments--with enhanced
embodied reasoning capabilities. Training code, datasets, and model checkpoints

Conclusion: 该数据集的发布将促进Geo-FMs在高光谱影像应用中的发展和评估，并支持地理偏见和泛化能力的研究。

Abstract: Comprehensive evaluation of geospatial foundation models (Geo-FMs) requires
benchmarking across diverse tasks, sensors, and geographic regions. However,
most existing benchmark datasets are limited to segmentation or classification
tasks, and focus on specific geographic areas. To address this gap, we
introduce a globally distributed dataset for forest aboveground biomass (AGB)
estimation, a pixel-wise regression task. This benchmark dataset combines
co-located hyperspectral imagery (HSI) from the Environmental Mapping and
Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite and predictions of AGB density estimates
derived from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidars, covering seven
continental regions. Our experimental results on this dataset demonstrate that
the evaluated Geo-FMs can match or, in some cases, surpass the performance of a
baseline U-Net, especially when fine-tuning the encoder. We also find that the
performance difference between the U-Net and Geo-FMs depends on the dataset
size for each region and highlight the importance of the token patch size in
the Vision Transformer backbone for accurate predictions in pixel-wise
regression tasks. By releasing this globally distributed hyperspectral
benchmark dataset, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of
Geo-FMs for HSI applications. Leveraging this dataset additionally enables
research into geographic bias and generalization capacity of Geo-FMs. The
dataset and source code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have transformed computer-assisted
intervention and surgical video analysis, driving improvements not only in
surgical training, intraoperative decision support, and patient outcomes, but
also in postoperative documentation and surgical discovery. Central to these
developments is the availability of large, high-quality annotated datasets. In
gynecologic laparoscopy, surgical scene understanding and action recognition
are fundamental for building intelligent systems that assist surgeons during
operations and provide deeper analysis after surgery. However, existing
datasets are often limited by small scale, narrow task focus, or insufficiently
detailed annotations, limiting their utility for comprehensive, end-to-end
workflow analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce GynSurg, the
largest and most diverse multi-task dataset for gynecologic laparoscopic
surgery to date. GynSurg provides rich annotations across multiple tasks,
supporting applications in action recognition, semantic segmentation, surgical
documentation, and discovery of novel procedural insights. We demonstrate the
dataset quality and versatility by benchmarking state-of-the-art models under a
standardized training protocol. To accelerate progress in the field, we
publicly release the GynSurg dataset and its annotations

Conclusion: C-reweight为安全可信的图像合成设定了新标准，解决了重标记不匹配问题并提升了水印效果。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of image generation models has revolutionized visual
content creation, enabling the synthesis of highly realistic and contextually
accurate images for diverse applications. However, the potential for misuse,
such as deepfake generation, image based phishing attacks, and fabrication of
misleading visual evidence, underscores the need for robust authenticity
verification mechanisms. While traditional statistical watermarking techniques
have proven effective for autoregressive language models, their direct
adaptation to image generation models encounters significant challenges due to
a phenomenon we term retokenization mismatch, a disparity between original and
retokenized sequences during the image generation process. To overcome this
limitation, we propose C-reweight, a novel, distortion-free watermarking method
explicitly designed for image generation models. By leveraging a
clustering-based strategy that treats tokens within the same cluster
equivalently, C-reweight mitigates retokenization mismatch while preserving
image fidelity. Extensive evaluations on leading image generation platforms
reveal that C-reweight not only maintains the visual quality of generated
images but also improves detectability over existing distortion-free
watermarking techniques, setting a new standard for secure and trustworthy
image synthesis.

Abstract: Subspace clustering has become widely adopted for the unsupervised analysis
of hyperspectral images (HSIs). Recent model-aware deep subspace clustering
methods often use a two-stage framework, involving the calculation of a
self-representation matrix with complexity of O(n^2), followed by spectral
clustering. However, these methods are computationally intensive, generally
incorporating solely either local or non-local spatial structure constraints,
and their structural constraints fall short of effectively supervising the
entire clustering process.
  We propose a scalable, context-preserving deep clustering method based on
basis representation, which jointly captures local and non-local structures for
efficient HSI clustering. To preserve local structure (i.e., spatial continuity
within subspaces), we introduce a spatial smoothness constraint that aligns
clustering predictions with their spatially filtered versions. For non-local
structure (i.e., spectral continuity), we employ a mini-cluster-based scheme
that refines predictions at the group level, encouraging spectrally similar
pixels to belong to the same subspace. Notably, these two constraints are
jointly optimized to reinforce each other.
  Specifically, our model is designed as an one-stage approach in which the
structural constraints are applied to the entire clustering process. The time
and space complexity of our method is O(n), making it applicable to large-scale
HSI data. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at:

Abstract: People get informed of a daily task plan through diverse media involving both
texts and images. However, most prior research only focuses on LLM's capability
of textual plan generation. The potential of large-scale models in providing
text-image plans remains understudied. Generating high-quality text-image plans
faces two main challenges: ensuring consistent alignment between two modalities
and keeping coherence among visual steps. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel framework that generates and refines text-image plans
step-by-step. At each iteration, our framework (1) drafts the next textual step
based on the prediction history; (2) edits the last visual step to obtain the
next one; (3) extracts PDDL-like visual information; and (4) refines the draft
with the extracted visual information. The textual and visual step produced in
stage (4) and (2) will then serve as inputs for the next iteration. Our
approach offers a plug-and-play improvement to various backbone models, such as
Mistral-7B, Gemini-1.5, and GPT-4o. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
approach, we collect a new benchmark consisting of 1,100 tasks and their
text-image pair solutions covering 11 daily topics. We also design and validate
a new set of metrics to evaluate the multimodal consistency and coherence in
text-image plans. Extensive experiment results show the effectiveness of our
approach on a range of backbone models against competitive baselines. Our code

*Weikai Sun,Shijie Song,Han Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态双向空间塔结构，替代传统注意力机制，以增强模型在视觉问答任务中的推理能力和空间关系理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂推理场景中表现不佳，主要由于跨模态交互不足和实体空间关系捕捉不充分。

Method: 提出动态双向空间塔，分为四层，模拟人类格式塔视觉原理观察图像，提供结构化先验。

Result: 实验表明该模块可应用于任何多模态模型，并在空间关系处理上表现优异；模型July在3B参数下达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型对图像内容的感知和组织能力，尤其在空间关系问答任务中表现突出。

Abstract: The Visual Question Answering (VQA) task requires the simultaneous
understanding of image content and question semantics. However, existing
methods often have difficulty handling complex reasoning scenarios due to
insufficient cross-modal interaction and capturing the entity spatial
relationships in the
image.\cite{huang2023adaptive}\cite{liu2021comparing}\cite{guibas2021adaptive}\cite{zhang2022vsa}We
studied a brand-new approach to replace the attention mechanism in order to
enhance the reasoning ability of the model and its understanding of spatial
relationships.Specifically, we propose a dynamic bidirectional spatial tower,
which is divided into four layers to observe the image according to the
principle of human gestalt vision. This naturally provides a powerful
structural prior for the spatial organization between entities, enabling the
model to no longer blindly search for relationships between pixels but make
judgments based on more meaningful perceptual units. Change from "seeing
images" to "perceiving and organizing image content".A large number of
experiments have shown that our module can be used in any other multimodal
model and achieve advanced results, demonstrating its potential in spatial
relationship processing.Meanwhile, the multimodal visual question-answering
model July trained by our method has achieved state-of-the-art results with
only 3B parameters, especially on the question-answering dataset of spatial
relations.

*Dokyoon Yoon,Youngsook Song,Woomyong Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种偏好学习方法（\mymethod\），通过针对幻觉发生的特定区域，减少多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉语言任务中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉语言任务中常生成输入图像中不存在的对象信息（幻觉），影响模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 构建包含幻觉响应、正确响应和目标信息的数据集，并应用偏好学习方法，专注于纠正幻觉的特定目标区域。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效减少了多种视觉幻觉任务中的幻觉，提升了MLLMs的可靠性和性能。

Conclusion: \mymethod\在不降低整体性能的情况下，显著减少了MLLMs的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently suffer from hallucination
issues, generating information about objects that are not present in input
images during vision-language tasks. These hallucinations particularly
undermine model reliability in practical applications requiring accurate object
identification. To address this challenge, we propose \mymethod,\ a preference
learning approach that mitigates hallucinations by focusing on targeted areas
where they occur. To implement this, we build a dataset containing hallucinated
responses, correct responses, and target information (i.e., objects present in
the images and the corresponding chunk positions in responses affected by
hallucinations). By applying a preference learning method restricted to these
specific targets, the model can filter out irrelevant signals and focus on
correcting hallucinations. This allows the model to produce more factual
responses by concentrating solely on relevant information. Experimental results
demonstrate that \mymethod\ effectively reduces hallucinations across multiple
vision hallucination tasks, improving the reliability and performance of MLLMs
without diminishing overall performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Auto-Connect是一种自动绑定骨骼的新方法，通过连接保留的标记化方案和拓扑感知奖励函数，显著提升骨骼结构的拓扑准确性和变形质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在预测骨骼位置时未能显式保留骨骼连接性，导致拓扑结构不准确。Auto-Connect旨在通过直接集成连接信息来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用连接保留的标记化方案定义关节端点，结合拓扑感知奖励函数和隐式测地特征进行骨骼选择和优化。

Result: 模型能够生成更符合解剖学结构的骨骼，并显著减少皮肤变形中的常见问题。

Conclusion: Auto-Connect通过结合多种技术，实现了高质量的骨骼绑定和变形效果。

Abstract: We introduce Auto-Connect, a novel approach for automatic rigging that
explicitly preserves skeletal connectivity through a connectivity-preserving
tokenization scheme. Unlike previous methods that predict bone positions
represented as two joints or first predict points before determining
connectivity, our method employs special tokens to define endpoints for each
joint's children and for each hierarchical layer, effectively automating
connectivity relationships. This approach significantly enhances topological
accuracy by integrating connectivity information directly into the prediction
framework. To further guarantee high-quality topology, we implement a
topology-aware reward function that quantifies topological correctness, which
is then utilized in a post-training phase through reward-guided Direct
Preference Optimization. Additionally, we incorporate implicit geodesic
features for latent top-k bone selection, which substantially improves skinning
quality. By leveraging geodesic distance information within the model's latent
space, our approach intelligently determines the most influential bones for
each vertex, effectively mitigating common skinning artifacts. This combination
of connectivity-preserving tokenization, reward-guided fine-tuning, and
geodesic-aware bone selection enables our model to consistently generate more
anatomically plausible skeletal structures with superior deformation
properties.

TL;DR: 提出了一种黑盒审计框架FSCA，用于文本到图像扩散模型的数据来源审计，无需模型内部知识，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在版权合规和隐私泄露方面的挑战，现有审计方法依赖模型内部知识或评估不可靠。

Method: 利用文本到图像扩散模型中的两种语义连接进行审计，提出FSCA框架，并引入召回平衡和阈值调整策略。

Result: 在LAION-mi和COCO数据集上实验，FSCA在多种指标和数据分布下优于8种基线方法，用户级准确率达90%。

Conclusion: FSCA在现实应用中具有强大的审计潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion model since its propose has significantly influenced
the content creation due to its impressive generation capability. However, this
capability depends on large-scale text-image datasets gathered from web
platforms like social media, posing substantial challenges in copyright
compliance and personal privacy leakage. Though there are some efforts devoted
to explore approaches for auditing data provenance in text-to-image diffusion
models, existing work has unrealistic assumptions that can obtain model
internal knowledge, e.g., intermediate results, or the evaluation is not
reliable. To fill this gap, we propose a completely black-box auditing
framework called Feature Semantic Consistency-based Auditing (FSCA). It
utilizes two types of semantic connections within the text-to-image diffusion
model for auditing, eliminating the need for access to internal knowledge. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of our FSCA framework, we perform extensive
experiments on LAION-mi dataset and COCO dataset, and compare with eight
state-of-the-art baseline approaches. The results show that FSCA surpasses
previous baseline approaches across various metrics and different data
distributions, showcasing the superiority of our FSCA. Moreover, we introduce a
recall balance strategy and a threshold adjustment strategy, which collectively
allows FSCA to reach up a user-level accuracy of 90% in a real-world auditing
scenario with only 10 samples/user, highlighting its strong auditing potential
in real-world applications. Our code is made available at

TL;DR: TAViS框架通过结合多模态基础模型（ImageBind）和分割基础模型（SAM2），解决音频-视觉分割中的跨模态对齐问题，并引入文本桥接设计和对齐监督策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频-视觉分割（AVS）面临跨模态对齐的挑战，现有方法未能有效结合多模态知识或解决特征空间差异问题。

Method: 提出TAViS框架，结合ImageBind和SAM2，引入文本桥接混合提示机制和对齐监督策略。

Result: 在单源、多源、语义数据集及零样本设置中表现优异。

Conclusion: TAViS通过文本桥接设计有效解决了跨模态对齐问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) faces a fundamental challenge of effectively
aligning audio and visual modalities. While recent approaches leverage
foundation models to address data scarcity, they often rely on single-modality
knowledge or combine foundation models in an off-the-shelf manner, failing to
address the cross-modal alignment challenge. In this paper, we present TAViS, a
novel framework that \textbf{couples} the knowledge of multimodal foundation
models (ImageBind) for cross-modal alignment and a segmentation foundation
model (SAM2) for precise segmentation. However, effectively combining these
models poses two key challenges: the difficulty in transferring the knowledge
between SAM2 and ImageBind due to their different feature spaces, and the
insufficiency of using only segmentation loss for supervision. To address these
challenges, we introduce a text-bridged design with two key components: (1) a
text-bridged hybrid prompting mechanism where pseudo text provides class
prototype information while retaining modality-specific details from both audio
and visual inputs, and (2) an alignment supervision strategy that leverages
text as a bridge to align shared semantic concepts within audio-visual
modalities. Our approach achieves superior performance on single-source,
multi-source, semantic datasets, and excels in zero-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决癌症亚型分类中标注数据稀缺的问题，同时提高模型的预测精度和效率。

Method: 在自监督对比学习模型中引入不确定性感知，通过计算证据向量评估预测置信度，并选择性标注关键图像。

Result: 仅需1-10%的标注数据即可在基准数据集上实现最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为标注数据有限的场景提供了高效解决方案，推动了数字病理学的发展。

Abstract: Machine-learning-assisted cancer subtyping is a promising avenue in digital
pathology. Cancer subtyping models, however, require careful training using
expert annotations so that they can be inferred with a degree of known
certainty (or uncertainty). To this end, we introduce the concept of
uncertainty awareness into a self-supervised contrastive learning model. This
is achieved by computing an evidence vector at every epoch, which assesses the
model's confidence in its predictions. The derived uncertainty score is then
utilized as a metric to selectively label the most crucial images that require
further annotation, thus iteratively refining the training process. With just
1-10% of strategically selected annotations, we attain state-of-the-art
performance in cancer subtyping on benchmark datasets. Our method not only
strategically guides the annotation process to minimize the need for extensive
labeled datasets, but also improves the precision and efficiency of
classifications. This development is particularly beneficial in settings where
the availability of labeled data is limited, offering a promising direction for
future research and application in digital pathology.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为V2LM的视觉语言模型，用于提升自动驾驶车辆（AV）感知任务的鲁棒性，相比传统DNN在对抗攻击下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DNN在对抗攻击下表现脆弱，且现有防御机制（如对抗训练）会降低正常精度且难以泛化。

Method: 提出V2LM模型，分为Solo Mode（单任务）和Tandem Mode（多任务）两种部署策略。

Result: V2LM在对抗攻击下精度下降小于8%，显著优于DNN（下降33%-46%）。Tandem Mode在内存效率上更优。

Conclusion: V2LM为AV感知系统提供了更安全、更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) rely on deep neural networks (DNNs) for critical
tasks such as traffic sign recognition (TSR), automated lane centering (ALC),
and vehicle detection (VD). However, these models are vulnerable to attacks
that can cause misclassifications and compromise safety. Traditional defense
mechanisms, including adversarial training, often degrade benign accuracy and
fail to generalize against unseen attacks. In this work, we introduce Vehicle
Vision Language Models (V2LMs), fine-tuned vision-language models specialized
for AV perception. Our findings demonstrate that V2LMs inherently exhibit
superior robustness against unseen attacks without requiring adversarial
training, maintaining significantly higher accuracy than conventional DNNs
under adversarial conditions. We evaluate two deployment strategies: Solo Mode,
where individual V2LMs handle specific perception tasks, and Tandem Mode, where
a single unified V2LM is fine-tuned for multiple tasks simultaneously.
Experimental results reveal that DNNs suffer performance drops of 33% to 46%
under attacks, whereas V2LMs maintain adversarial accuracy with reductions of
less than 8% on average. The Tandem Mode further offers a memory-efficient
alternative while achieving comparable robustness to Solo Mode. We also explore
integrating V2LMs as parallel components to AV perception to enhance resilience
against adversarial threats. Our results suggest that V2LMs offer a promising
path toward more secure and resilient AV perception systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake视频对数字安全、隐私和媒体完整性构成威胁，现有研究多集中于二元检测，而模型溯源任务尚未充分探索。

Method: FAME通过多级嵌入和时空注意力机制捕捉不同模型的生成痕迹，兼顾准确性和计算效率。

Result: 在DFDM、FaceForensics++和FakeAVCeleb数据集上，FAME在准确性和运行时间上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FAME在现实取证和信息安全应用中具有潜在部署价值。

Abstract: The widespread emergence of face-swap Deepfake videos poses growing risks to
digital security, privacy, and media integrity, necessitating effective
forensic tools for identifying the source of such manipulations. Although most
prior research has focused primarily on binary Deepfake detection, the task of
model attribution -- determining which generative model produced a given
Deepfake -- remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce FAME (Fake
Attribution via Multilevel Embeddings), a lightweight and efficient
spatio-temporal framework designed to capture subtle generative artifacts
specific to different face-swap models. FAME integrates spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms to improve attribution accuracy while remaining
computationally efficient. We evaluate our model on three challenging and
diverse datasets: Deepfake Detection and Manipulation (DFDM), FaceForensics++,
and FakeAVCeleb. Results show that FAME consistently outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and runtime, highlighting its potential for deployment
in real-world forensic and information security applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出环境变化检测（ECD）任务，解决传统场景变化检测（SCD）中参考图像与查询图像视角对齐不切实际的问题，并通过多参考候选和语义表征聚合提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SCD假设参考图像与查询图像视角完全对齐，不切实际。ECD旨在利用环境线索，更贴近实际应用场景。

Method: 提出新框架，通过多参考候选和语义表征聚合解决视角偏差和视野限制问题。

Result: 在三个标准基准集上显著优于现有方法，性能接近理想设置。

Conclusion: ECD为场景变化检测提供了更实用的解决方案，框架性能优越。

Abstract: Humans do not memorize everything. Thus, humans recognize scene changes by
exploring the past images. However, available past (i.e., reference) images
typically represent nearby viewpoints of the present (i.e., query) scene,
rather than the identical view. Despite this practical limitation, conventional
Scene Change Detection (SCD) has been formalized under an idealized setting in
which reference images with matching viewpoints are available for every query.
In this paper, we push this problem toward a practical task and introduce
Environmental Change Detection (ECD). A key aspect of ECD is to avoid
unrealistically aligned query-reference pairs and rely solely on environmental
cues. Inspired by real-world practices, we provide these cues through a
large-scale database of uncurated images. To address this new task, we propose
a novel framework that jointly understands spatial environments and detects
changes. The main idea is that matching at the same spatial locations between a
query and a reference may lead to a suboptimal solution due to viewpoint
misalignment and limited field-of-view (FOV) coverage. We deal with this
limitation by leveraging multiple reference candidates and aggregating
semantically rich representations for change detection. We evaluate our
framework on three standard benchmark sets reconstructed for ECD, and
significantly outperform a naive combination of state-of-the-art methods while
achieving comparable performance to the oracle setting. The code will be
released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The advent of accessible Generative AI tools enables anyone to create and
spread synthetic images on social media, often with the intention to mislead,
thus posing a significant threat to online information integrity. Most existing
Synthetic Image Detection (SID) solutions struggle on generated images sourced
from the Internet, as these are often altered by compression and other
operations. To address this, our research enhances SID by exploring data
augmentation combinations, leveraging a genetic algorithm for optimal
augmentation selection, and introducing a dual-criteria optimization approach.
These methods significantly improve model performance under real-world
perturbations. Our findings provide valuable insights for developing detection
models capable of identifying synthetic images across varying qualities and
transformations, with the best-performing model achieving a mean average
precision increase of +22.53% compared to models without augmentations. The

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何关系优化了伪标签和目标提示学习，显著提升了无监督域自适应的效果。

Abstract: Recent approaches leveraging multi-modal pre-trained models like CLIP for
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) have shown significant promise in bridging
domain gaps and improving generalization by utilizing rich semantic knowledge
and robust visual representations learned through extensive pre-training on
diverse image-text datasets. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art
performance across benchmarks, much of the improvement stems from base
pseudo-labels (CLIP zero-shot predictions) and self-training mechanisms. Thus,
the training mechanism exhibits a key limitation wherein the visual embedding
distribution in target domains can deviate from the visual embedding
distribution in the pre-trained model, leading to misguided signals from class
descriptions. This work introduces a fresh solution to reinforce these
pseudo-labels and facilitate target-prompt learning, by exploiting the geometry
of visual and text embeddings - an aspect that is overlooked by existing
methods. We first propose to directly leverage the reference predictions (from
source prompts) based on the relationship between source and target visual
embeddings. We later show that there is a strong clustering behavior observed
between visual and text embeddings in pre-trained multi-modal models. Building
on optimal transport theory, we transform this insight into a novel strategy to
enforce the clustering property in text embeddings, further enhancing the
alignment in the target domain. Our experiments and ablation studies validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating superior performance
and improved quality of target prompts in terms of representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BridgeTower模型在单模态表示利用、灵活语义知识挖掘和低分辨率数据集评估方面存在局限性。

Method: 在Two-Tower VLM架构中引入ManagerTower，并在多模态大语言模型（MLLM）架构中验证其有效性。

Result: ManagerTower在4项下游任务中表现优异，LLaVA-OV-Manager在20个数据集上显著提升零样本性能。

Conclusion: Manager插件通过深度和宽度两个正交视角提升视觉表示，与多网格算法协同进一步优化性能。

Abstract: Two-Tower Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across various downstream VL tasks. While BridgeTower further enhances
performance by building bridges between encoders, it \textit{(i)} suffers from
ineffective layer-by-layer utilization of unimodal representations,
\textit{(ii)} restricts the flexible exploitation of different levels of
unimodal semantic knowledge, and \textit{(iii)} is limited to the evaluation on
traditional low-resolution datasets only with the Two-Tower VLM architecture.
In this work, we propose Manager, a lightweight, efficient and effective plugin
that adaptively aggregates insights from different levels of pre-trained
unimodal experts to facilitate more comprehensive VL alignment and fusion.
First, under the Two-Tower VLM architecture, we introduce ManagerTower, a novel
VLM that introduces the manager in each cross-modal layer. Whether with or
without VL pre-training, ManagerTower outperforms previous strong baselines and
achieves superior performance on 4 downstream VL tasks. Moreover, we extend our
exploration to the latest Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture.
We demonstrate that LLaVA-OV-Manager significantly boosts the zero-shot
performance of LLaVA-OV across different categories of capabilities, images,
and resolutions on 20 downstream datasets, whether the multi-grid algorithm is
enabled or not. In-depth analysis reveals that both our manager and the
multi-grid algorithm can be viewed as a plugin that improves the visual
representation by capturing more diverse visual details from two orthogonal
perspectives (depth and width). Their synergy can mitigate the semantic
ambiguity caused by the multi-grid algorithm and further improve performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传感器平台的初始状态估计常因初始测量信息有限而导致估计不准确，容易陷入非线性优化的局部最优解。

Method: 方法初期依赖GNSS相对距离残差，并基于Hessian矩阵奇异值的变化引入切换全局测量的准则。

Result: 在EuRoC和GVINS数据集上的实验表明，该方法比从一开始使用全局GNSS数据的策略更准确和鲁棒。

Conclusion: 提出的策略通过延迟使用全局测量，显著提高了初始化的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a
limited set of initial measurements often carry limited information, leading to
poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during non-linear
optimization. This paper proposes a novel GNSS-inertial initialization strategy
that delays the use of global GNSS measurements until sufficient information is
available to accurately estimate the transformation between the GNSS and
inertial frames. Instead, the method initially relies on GNSS relative distance
residuals. To determine the optimal moment for switching to global
measurements, we introduce a criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian
matrix singular values. Experiments on the EuRoC and GVINS datasets show that
our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of using global GNSS
data from the start, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.

Result: 实验表明，FIMA-Q在多种ViT架构和任务中显著提升了量化精度，尤其在低比特量化下表现优异。

Conclusion: FIMA-Q是一种高效的PTQ方法，显著改善了ViTs在低比特量化下的性能，为模型压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has stood out as a cost-effective and
promising model compression paradigm in recent years, as it avoids
computationally intensive model retraining. Nevertheless, current PTQ methods
for Vision Transformers (ViTs) still suffer from significant accuracy
degradation, especially under low-bit quantization. To address these
shortcomings, we analyze the prevailing Hessian-guided quantization loss, and
uncover certain limitations of conventional Hessian approximations. By
following the block-wise reconstruction framework, we propose a novel PTQ
method for ViTs, dubbed FIMA-Q. Specifically, we firstly establish the
connection between KL divergence and FIM, which enables fast computation of the
quantization loss during reconstruction. We further propose an efficient FIM
approximation method, namely DPLR-FIM, by employing the diagonal plus low-rank
principle, and formulate the ultimate quantization loss. Our extensive
experiments, conducted across various vision tasks with representative
ViT-based architectures on public datasets, demonstrate that our method
substantially promotes the accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art
approaches, especially in the case of low-bit quantization. The source code is

SITS-Extreme, a novel framework that leverages satellite image time series to

approach effectively filters out irrelevant changes while isolating
disaster-relevant signals, enabling more accurate detection. Extensive
experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets validate the
effectiveness of SITS-Extreme, demonstrating substantial improvements over
widely used strong bi-temporal baselines. Additionally, we examine the impact
of incorporating more timesteps, analyze the contribution of key components in
our framework, and evaluate its performance across different disaster types,
offering valuable insights into its scalability and applicability for
large-scale disaster monitoring.

TL;DR: EyeSimVQA是一种基于自由能量的自修复视频质量评估框架，通过双分支架构和生物启发设计，在性能和可解释性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频质量评估（VQA）中，时空动态和模型限制带来独特挑战，现有方法在自修复机制上探索不足。

Method: 提出双分支架构（美学分支和技术分支），结合自由能量自修复模块和生物启发的预测头，模拟自适应修复行为。

Result: 在五个公开VQA基准测试中表现优异，性能优于或媲美现有方法。

Conclusion: EyeSimVQA通过生物启发设计和自修复机制，提升了VQA的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Free-energy-guided self-repair mechanisms have shown promising results in
image quality assessment (IQA), but remain under-explored in video quality
assessment (VQA), where temporal dynamics and model constraints pose unique
challenges. Unlike static images, video content exhibits richer spatiotemporal
complexity, making perceptual restoration more difficult. Moreover, VQA systems
often rely on pre-trained backbones, which limits the direct integration of
enhancement modules without affecting model stability. To address these issues,
we propose EyeSimVQA, a novel VQA framework that incorporates free-energy-based
self-repair. It adopts a dual-branch architecture, with an aesthetic branch for
global perceptual evaluation and a technical branch for fine-grained structural
and semantic analysis. Each branch integrates specialized enhancement modules
tailored to distinct visual inputs-resized full-frame images and patch-based
fragments-to simulate adaptive repair behaviors. We also explore a principled
strategy for incorporating high-level visual features without disrupting the
original backbone. In addition, we design a biologically inspired prediction
head that models sweeping gaze dynamics to better fuse global and local
representations for quality prediction. Experiments on five public VQA
benchmarks demonstrate that EyeSimVQA achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while offering improved
interpretability through its biologically grounded design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在精细时间推理方面存在局限，难以准确关联视频时刻与响应，尤其是在有限监督下。

Method: 提出Temporal-aware Fuseformer，采用分层双流架构捕获时间动态并融合视觉与音频信息，结合全局残差提升效率，通过四阶段渐进训练范式增强多模态对齐、语义基础和时间推理能力。

Result: 在时间定位和视频问答任务中，DaMO显著优于现有方法，尤其在精确时间对齐和推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: DaMO为数据高效的视频-语言建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been extended to the video domain,
enabling sophisticated video-language understanding. However, existing Video
LLMs often exhibit limitations in fine-grained temporal reasoning, restricting
their ability to precisely attribute responses to specific video moments,
especially under constrained supervision. We introduce DaMO, a data-efficient
Video LLM explicitly designed for accurate temporal reasoning and multimodal
understanding. At its core, the proposed Temporal-aware Fuseformer employs a
hierarchical dual-stream architecture that progressively captures temporal
dynamics within each modality and effectively fuses complementary visual and
audio information. To further enhance computational efficiency, DaMO integrates
a global residual that reduces spatial redundancy while preserving essential
semantic details. We train DaMO via a structured four-stage progressive
training paradigm, incrementally equipping the model with multimodal alignment,
semantic grounding, and temporal reasoning capabilities. This work also
contributes multiple datasets augmented from existing ones with GPT-generated
temporally grounded QA pairs for tasks requiring temporal supervision.
Comprehensive experiments on temporal grounding and video QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DaMO consistently surpasses prior methods, particularly in
tasks demanding precise temporal alignment and reasoning. Our work establishes
a promising direction for data-efficient video-language modeling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动编辑视觉线索的流程和VFaith-Bench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉推理能力及其对视觉信息的忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在复杂问题解决中表现提升的原因尚不明确，尤其是视觉线索提取与推理过程的贡献难以量化。

Method: 通过GPT-Image-1辅助的自动编辑流程生成对比问答对，并设计VFaith-Bench基准测试模型能力。

Result: 构建了755个测试条目，测试主流模型并揭示其推理能力与视觉感知的关系。

Conclusion: VFaith-Bench为评估MLLMs视觉推理能力提供了新工具，揭示了模型性能与视觉忠实性的关联。

Abstract: Recent extensive works have demonstrated that by introducing long CoT, the
capabilities of MLLMs to solve complex problems can be effectively enhanced.
However, the reasons for the effectiveness of such paradigms remain unclear. It
is challenging to analysis with quantitative results how much the model's
specific extraction of visual cues and its subsequent so-called reasoning
during inference process contribute to the performance improvements. Therefore,
evaluating the faithfulness of MLLMs' reasoning to visual information is
crucial. To address this issue, we first present a cue-driven automatic and
controllable editing pipeline with the help of GPT-Image-1. It enables the
automatic and precise editing of specific visual cues based on the instruction.
Furthermore, we introduce VFaith-Bench, the first benchmark to evaluate MLLMs'
visual reasoning capabilities and analyze the source of such capabilities with
an emphasis on the visual faithfulness. Using the designed pipeline, we
constructed comparative question-answer pairs by altering the visual cues in
images that are crucial for solving the original reasoning problem, thereby
changing the question's answer. By testing similar questions with images that
have different details, the average accuracy reflects the model's visual
reasoning ability, while the difference in accuracy before and after editing
the test set images effectively reveals the relationship between the model's
reasoning ability and visual perception. We further designed specific metrics
to expose this relationship. VFaith-Bench includes 755 entries divided into
five distinct subsets, along with an additional human-labeled perception task.
We conducted in-depth testing and analysis of existing mainstream flagship
models and prominent open-source model series/reasoning models on VFaith-Bench,
further investigating the underlying factors of their reasoning capabilities.

Result: 精度87%，召回率91.7%，推理时间1.4毫秒，适合实时应用。

Conclusion: 方法有效，但可通过增加数据集或图像增强进一步优化。

Abstract: The identification and classification of vehicles play a crucial role in
various aspects of the control-sanction system. Current technologies such as
weigh-in-motion (WIM) systems can classify most vehicle categories but they
struggle to accurately classify vehicles with lifted axles. Moreover, very few
commercial and technical methods exist for detecting lifted axles. In this
paper, as part of the European project SETO (Smart Enforcement of Transport
Operations), a method based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely
YOLOv8s, was proposed for the detection of lifted truck axles in images of
trucks captured by cameras placed perpendicular to the direction of traffic.
The performance of the proposed method was assessed and it was found that it
had a precision of 87%, a recall of 91.7%, and an inference time of 1.4 ms,
which makes it well-suited for real time implantations. These results suggest
that further improvements could be made, potentially by increasing the size of
the datasets and/or by using various image augmentation methods.

Conclusion: OV-MAP是一种无需依赖3D监督分割模型的准确、鲁棒且适应性强的开放世界3D映射方法。

Abstract: We introduce OV-MAP, a novel approach to open-world 3D mapping for mobile
robots by integrating open-features into 3D maps to enhance object recognition
capabilities. A significant challenge arises when overlapping features from
adjacent voxels reduce instance-level precision, as features spill over voxel
boundaries, blending neighboring regions together. Our method overcomes this by
employing a class-agnostic segmentation model to project 2D masks into 3D
space, combined with a supplemented depth image created by merging raw and
synthetic depth from point clouds. This approach, along with a 3D mask voting
mechanism, enables accurate zero-shot 3D instance segmentation without relying
on 3D supervised segmentation models. We assess the effectiveness of our method
through comprehensive experiments on public datasets such as ScanNet200 and
Replica, demonstrating superior zero-shot performance, robustness, and
adaptability across diverse environments. Additionally, we conducted real-world
experiments to demonstrate our method's adaptability and robustness when
applied to diverse real-world environments.

Conclusion: EasyARC为视觉语言模型的真实推理和测试时扩展能力设定了新标准。

Abstract: Building on recent advances in language-based reasoning models, we explore
multimodal reasoning that integrates vision and text. Existing multimodal
benchmarks primarily test visual extraction combined with text-based reasoning,
lacking true visual reasoning with more complex interactions between vision and
language. Inspired by the ARC challenge, we introduce EasyARC, a
vision-language benchmark requiring multi-image, multi-step reasoning, and
self-correction. EasyARC is procedurally generated, fully verifiable, and
scalable, making it ideal for reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines. The
generators incorporate progressive difficulty levels, enabling structured
evaluation across task types and complexities. We benchmark state-of-the-art
vision-language models and analyze their failure modes. We argue that EasyARC
sets a new standard for evaluating true reasoning and test-time scaling
capabilities in vision-language models. We open-source our benchmark dataset
and evaluation code.

Method: 结合自动化校正阶段和自适应平衡采集函数，利用标注者反馈扩展校正范围并优化尾类处理。

Result: 在Cityscapes和PASCAL VOC 2012上表现优异，仅用20%预算即超越现有方法，性能提升27.23%。

Conclusion: A$^2$LC在效率和效果上均显著优于现有方法，为语义分割标签校正提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Active Label Correction (ALC) has emerged as a promising solution to the high
cost and error-prone nature of manual pixel-wise annotation in semantic
segmentation, by selectively identifying and correcting mislabeled data.
Although recent work has improved correction efficiency by generating
pseudo-labels using foundation models, substantial inefficiencies still remain.
In this paper, we propose Active and Automated Label Correction for semantic
segmentation (A$^2$LC), a novel and efficient ALC framework that integrates an
automated correction stage into the conventional pipeline. Specifically, the
automated correction stage leverages annotator feedback to perform label
correction beyond the queried samples, thereby maximizing cost efficiency. In
addition, we further introduce an adaptively balanced acquisition function that
emphasizes underrepresented tail classes and complements the automated
correction mechanism. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012
demonstrate that A$^2$LC significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art
methods. Notably, A$^2$LC achieves high efficiency by outperforming previous
methods using only 20% of their budget, and demonstrates strong effectiveness
by yielding a 27.23% performance improvement under an equivalent budget
constraint on the Cityscapes dataset. The code will be released upon
acceptance.

Conclusion: 多模态协作感知方法显著提升了WiFi行为识别的准确性。

Abstract: WiFi-based human behavior recognition aims to recognize gestures and
activities by analyzing wireless signal variations. However, existing methods
typically focus on a single type of data, neglecting the interaction and fusion
of multiple features. To this end, we propose a novel multimodal collaborative
awareness method. By leveraging phase data reflecting changes in dynamic path
length and Doppler Shift (DFS) data corresponding to frequency changes related
to the speed of gesture movement, we enable efficient interaction and fusion of
these features to improve recognition accuracy. Specifically, we first
introduce a dual-branch self-attention module to capture spatial-temporal cues
within each modality. Then, a group attention mechanism is applied to the
concatenated phase and DFS features to mine key group features critical for
behavior recognition. Through a gating mechanism, the combined features are
further divided into PD-strengthen and PD-weaken branches, optimizing
information entropy and promoting cross-modal collaborative awareness.
Extensive in-domain and cross-domain experiments on two large publicly
available datasets, Widar3.0 and XRF55, demonstrate the superior performance of
our method.

Conclusion: SignAligner通过多模态协作和动态校正，实现了高质量的手语生成。

Abstract: Sign language generation aims to produce diverse sign representations based
on spoken language. However, achieving realistic and naturalistic generation
remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of sign language, which
encompasses intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. In
this work, we introduce PHOENIX14T+, an extended version of the widely-used
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather 2014T dataset, featuring three new sign representations:
Pose, Hamer and Smplerx. We also propose a novel method, SignAligner, for
realistic sign language generation, consisting of three stages: text-driven
pose modalities co-generation, online collaborative correction of
multimodality, and realistic sign video synthesis. First, by incorporating text
semantics, we design a joint sign language generator to simultaneously produce
posture coordinates, gesture actions, and body movements. The text encoder,
based on a Transformer architecture, extracts semantic features, while a
cross-modal attention mechanism integrates these features to generate diverse
sign language representations, ensuring accurate mapping and controlling the
diversity of modal features. Next, online collaborative correction is
introduced to refine the generated pose modalities using a dynamic loss
weighting strategy and cross-modal attention, facilitating the complementarity
of information across modalities, eliminating spatiotemporal conflicts, and
ensuring semantic coherence and action consistency. Finally, the corrected pose
modalities are fed into a pre-trained video generation network to produce
high-fidelity sign language videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SignAligner significantly improves both the accuracy and expressiveness of the
generated sign videos.

Conclusion: 该方法为肤色相关的公平性评估提供了更灵活、精确的解决方案，弥补了传统分类方法的不足。

Abstract: Fairness is a critical component of Trustworthy AI. In this paper, we focus
on Machine Learning (ML) and the performance of model predictions when dealing
with skin color. Unlike other sensitive attributes, the nature of skin color
differs significantly. In computer vision, skin color is represented as tensor
data rather than categorical values or single numerical points. However, much
of the research on fairness across sensitive groups has focused on categorical
features such as gender and race. This paper introduces a new technique for
evaluating fairness in ML for image classification tasks, specifically without
the use of annotation. To address the limitations of prior work, we handle
tensor data, like skin color, without classifying it rigidly. Instead, we
convert it into probability distributions and apply statistical distance
measures. This novel approach allows us to capture fine-grained nuances in
fairness both within and across what would traditionally be considered distinct
groups. Additionally, we propose an innovative training method to mitigate the
latent biases present in conventional skin tone categorization. This method
leverages color distance estimates calculated through Bayesian regression with
polynomial functions, ensuring a more nuanced and equitable treatment of skin
color in ML models.

Result: DISCO在不同偏置缓解实验中表现优异，成为传统核方法的有效替代。

Conclusion: SAM和DISCO为反因果预测提供了新框架，有效减少无关信号的干扰。

Abstract: During prediction tasks, models can use any signal they receive to come up
with the final answer - including signals that are causally irrelevant. When
predicting objects from images, for example, the lighting conditions could be
correlated to different targets through selection bias, and an oblivious model
might use these signals as shortcuts to discern between various objects. A
predictor that uses lighting conditions instead of real object-specific details
is obviously undesirable. To address this challenge, we introduce a standard
anti-causal prediction model (SAM) that creates a causal framework for
analyzing the information pathways influencing our predictor in anti-causal
settings. We demonstrate that a classifier satisfying a specific conditional
independence criterion will focus solely on the direct causal path from label
to image, being counterfactually invariant to the remaining variables. Finally,
we propose DISCO, a novel regularization strategy that uses conditional
distance correlation to optimize for conditional independence in regression
tasks. We can show that DISCO achieves competitive results in different bias
mitigation experiments, deeming it a valid alternative to classical
kernel-based methods.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了X射线图像中违禁物品的实例分割问题，相关数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of prohibited items in security X-ray images is a
critical yet challenging task. This is mainly caused by the significant
appearance gap between prohibited items in X-ray images and natural objects, as
well as the severe overlapping among objects in X-ray images. To address these
issues, we propose an occlusion-aware instance segmentation pipeline designed
to identify prohibited items in X-ray images. Specifically, to bridge the
representation gap, we integrate the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into our
pipeline, taking advantage of its rich priors and zero-shot generalization
capabilities. To address the overlap between prohibited items, we design an
occlusion-aware bilayer mask decoder module that explicitly models the
occlusion relationships. To supervise occlusion estimation, we manually
annotated occlusion areas of prohibited items in two large-scale X-ray image
segmentation datasets, PIDray and PIXray. We then reorganized these additional
annotations together with the original information as two occlusion-annotated
datasets, PIDray-A and PIXray-A. Extensive experimental results on these
occlusion-annotated datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
method. The datasets and codes are available at: https://github.com/Ryh1218/Occ

Abstract: Continual multimodal instruction tuning is crucial for adapting Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to evolving tasks. However, most existing methods
adopt a fixed architecture, struggling with adapting to new tasks due to static
model capacity. We propose to evolve the architecture under parameter budgets
for dynamic task adaptation, which remains unexplored and imposes two
challenges: 1) task architecture conflict, where different tasks require
varying layer-wise adaptations, and 2) modality imbalance, where different
tasks rely unevenly on modalities, leading to unbalanced updates. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Dynamic Mixture of Curriculum LoRA Experts
(D-MoLE) method, which automatically evolves MLLM's architecture with
controlled parameter budgets to continually adapt to new tasks while retaining
previously learned knowledge. Specifically, we propose a dynamic layer-wise
expert allocator, which automatically allocates LoRA experts across layers to
resolve architecture conflicts, and routes instructions layer-wisely to
facilitate knowledge sharing among experts. Then, we propose a gradient-based
inter-modal continual curriculum, which adjusts the update ratio of each module
in MLLM based on the difficulty of each modality within the task to alleviate
the modality imbalance problem. Extensive experiments show that D-MoLE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 15% average
improvement over the best baseline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study of continual learning for MLLMs from an architectural perspective.

Conclusion: CM-CGNS能有效学习鲁棒的医学视觉表示，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Learning medical visual representations directly from paired images and
reports through multimodal self-supervised learning has emerged as a novel and
efficient approach to digital diagnosis in recent years. However, existing
models suffer from several severe limitations. 1) neglecting the selection of
negative samples, resulting in the scarcity of hard negatives and the inclusion
of false negatives; 2) focusing on global feature extraction, but overlooking
the fine-grained local details that are crucial for medical image recognition
tasks; and 3) contrastive learning primarily targets high-level features but
ignoring low-level details which are essential for accurate medical analysis.
Motivated by these critical issues, this paper presents a Cross-Modal
Cluster-Guided Negative Sampling (CM-CGNS) method with two-fold ideas. First,
it extends the k-means clustering used for local text features in the
single-modal domain to the multimodal domain through cross-modal attention.
This improvement increases the number of negative samples and boosts the model
representation capability. Second, it introduces a Cross-Modal Masked Image
Reconstruction (CM-MIR) module that leverages local text-to-image features
obtained via cross-modal attention to reconstruct masked local image regions.
This module significantly strengthens the model's cross-modal information
interaction capabilities and retains low-level image features essential for
downstream tasks. By well handling the aforementioned limitations, the proposed
CM-CGNS can learn effective and robust medical visual representations suitable
for various recognition tasks. Extensive experimental results on
classification, detection, and segmentation tasks across five downstream
datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on
multiple metrics, verifying its superior performance.

Result: 分割任务得分为0.8601，分类任务得分为0.7346。

Conclusion: 该方法在预测肺纤维化患者生存结果方面表现出潜力。

Abstract: The primary objective of the AIIB 2023 competition is to evaluate the
predictive significance of airway-related imaging biomarkers in determining the
survival outcomes of patients with lung fibrosis.This study introduces a
comprehensive three-stage approach. Initially, a segmentation network, namely
nn-Unet, is employed to delineate the airway's structural boundaries.
Subsequently, key features are extracted from the radiomic images centered
around the trachea and an enclosing bounding box around the airway. This step
is motivated by the potential presence of critical survival-related insights
within the tracheal region as well as pertinent information encoded in the
structure and dimensions of the airway. Lastly, radiomic features obtained from
the segmented areas are integrated into an SVM classifier. We could obtain an
overall-score of 0.8601 for the segmentation in Task 1 while 0.7346 for the
classification in Task 2.

Motivation: 探索不同模型在人类动作识别任务中的表现差异，尤其是Transformer架构的潜力。

Method: 使用COCO数据集的三类子集，测试了全连接网络、卷积网络、CLIP模型和ViT的性能，并通过统计分析和可视化技术（SHAP和LeGrad）解释模型行为。

Result: ViT表现最佳（90%准确率），显著优于其他模型。可视化显示ViT能更准确地关注动作关键区域。

Conclusion: Transformer架构在动作识别中具有数据高效性，可视化技术有助于诊断模型错误。

Abstract: This study explores human action recognition using a three-class subset of
the COCO image corpus, benchmarking models from simple fully connected networks
to transformer architectures. The binary Vision Transformer (ViT) achieved 90%
mean test accuracy, significantly exceeding multiclass classifiers such as
convolutional networks (approximately 35%) and CLIP-based models (approximately
62-64%). A one-way ANOVA (F = 61.37, p < 0.001) confirmed these differences are
statistically significant. Qualitative analysis with SHAP explainer and LeGrad
heatmaps indicated that the ViT localizes pose-specific regions (e.g., lower
limbs for walking or running), while simpler feed-forward models often focus on
background textures, explaining their errors. These findings emphasize the data
efficiency of transformer representations and the importance of explainability
techniques in diagnosing class-specific failures.

Motivation: 现有基准无法评估模型在多表格图像上的解析和推理能力，MTabVQA填补了这一空白。

Method: 提出MTabVQA基准，包含3,745个复杂问题对，并开发MTabVQA-Instruct数据集用于微调模型。

Result: 实验显示现有模型在MTabVQA上表现有限，但通过微调可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: MTabVQA为多表格视觉推理提供了新基准，微调方法有效提升了模型能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
interpreting visual layouts and text. However, a significant challenge remains
in their ability to interpret robustly and reason over multi-tabular data
presented as images, a common occurrence in real-world scenarios like web pages
and digital documents. Existing benchmarks typically address single tables or
non-visual data (text/structured). This leaves a critical gap: they don't
assess the ability to parse diverse table images, correlate information across
them, and perform multi-hop reasoning on the combined visual data. We introduce
MTabVQA, a novel benchmark specifically designed for multi-tabular visual
question answering to bridge that gap. MTabVQA comprises 3,745 complex
question-answer pairs that necessitate multi-hop reasoning across several
visually rendered table images. We provide extensive benchmark results for
state-of-the-art VLMs on MTabVQA, revealing significant performance
limitations. We further investigate post-training techniques to enhance these
reasoning abilities and release MTabVQA-Instruct, a large-scale
instruction-tuning dataset. Our experiments show that fine-tuning VLMs with
MTabVQA-Instruct substantially improves their performance on visual
multi-tabular reasoning. Code and dataset

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖完整模态假设，无法动态平衡模态贡献且忽视模态间结构关系，导致在真实临床场景中表现不佳。

Method: DMAF-Net采用动态模态感知融合模块、协同关系蒸馏与原型蒸馏框架，以及动态训练监控策略。

Result: 在BraTS2020和MyoPS2020数据集上的实验表明，DMAF-Net优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DMAF-Net通过动态平衡模态贡献和结构关系，有效解决了模态不平衡问题，提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal medical image segmentation faces critical challenges
from modality imbalance, including imbalanced modality missing rates and
heterogeneous modality contributions. Due to their reliance on idealized
assumptions of complete modality availability, existing methods fail to
dynamically balance contributions and neglect the structural relationships
between modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance in real-world clinical
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model, named
Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion Network (DMAF-Net). The DMAF-Net adopts three key
ideas. First, it introduces a Dynamic Modality-Aware Fusion (DMAF) module to
suppress missing-modality interference by combining transformer attention with
adaptive masking and weight modality contributions dynamically through
attention maps. Second, it designs a synergistic Relation Distillation and
Prototype Distillation framework to enforce global-local feature alignment via
covariance consistency and masked graph attention, while ensuring semantic
consistency through cross-modal class-specific prototype alignment. Third, it
presents a Dynamic Training Monitoring (DTM) strategy to stabilize optimization
under imbalanced missing rates by tracking distillation gaps in real-time, and
to balance convergence speeds across modalities by adaptively reweighting
losses and scaling gradients. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and MyoPS2020
demonstrate that DMAF-Net outperforms existing methods for incomplete
multi-modal medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on BraTS2020 and

particular strength on datasets requiring deeper semantic coherence or

Conclusion: DiffFuSR展示了生成先验和融合策略在Sentinel-2超分辨率中的潜力，提供了模块化解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents DiffFuSR, a modular pipeline for super-resolving all 12
spectral bands of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery to a unified ground sampling
distance (GSD) of 2.5 meters. The pipeline comprises two stages: (i) a
diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) model trained on high-resolution RGB
imagery from the NAIP and WorldStrat datasets, harmonized to simulate
Sentinel-2 characteristics; and (ii) a learned fusion network that upscales the
remaining multispectral bands using the super-resolved RGB image as a spatial
prior. We introduce a robust degradation model and contrastive degradation
encoder to support blind SR. Extensive evaluations of the proposed SR pipeline
on the OpenSR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
current SOTA baselines in terms of reflectance fidelity, spectral consistency,
spatial alignment, and hallucination suppression. Furthermore, the fusion
network significantly outperforms classical pansharpening approaches, enabling
accurate enhancement of Sentinel-2's 20 m and 60 m bands. This study
underscores the power of harmonized learning with generative priors and fusion
strategies to create a modular framework for Sentinel-2 SR. Our code and models

TL;DR: MambaVSR提出了一种基于状态空间模型的视频超分辨率框架，通过内容感知扫描机制解决了现有方法在处理大运动位移和长视频序列时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频超分辨率（VSR）在建模非局部依赖关系时面临挑战，现有方法（如光流或Transformer）难以处理大运动位移和长序列。

Method: MambaVSR结合了共享罗盘构造（SCC）和内容感知序列化（CAS）模块，动态建模时空交互；全局-局部状态空间块（GLSSB）整合窗口自注意力与状态空间模型。

Result: 在REDS数据集上，MambaVSR比基于Transformer的方法PSNR提升0.58 dB，且参数减少55%。

Conclusion: MambaVSR通过创新的状态空间模型和内容感知机制，显著提升了视频超分辨率的性能与效率。

Abstract: Video super-resolution (VSR) faces critical challenges in effectively
modeling non-local dependencies across misaligned frames while preserving
computational efficiency. Existing VSR methods typically rely on optical flow
strategies or transformer architectures, which struggle with large motion
displacements and long video sequences. To address this, we propose MambaVSR,
the first state-space model framework for VSR that incorporates an innovative
content-aware scanning mechanism. Unlike rigid 1D sequential processing in
conventional vision Mamba methods, our MambaVSR enables dynamic spatiotemporal
interactions through the Shared Compass Construction (SCC) and the
Content-Aware Sequentialization (CAS). Specifically, the SCC module constructs
intra-frame semantic connectivity graphs via efficient sparse attention and
generates adaptive spatial scanning sequences through spectral clustering.
Building upon SCC, the CAS module effectively aligns and aggregates non-local
similar content across multiple frames by interleaving temporal features along
the learned spatial order. To bridge global dependencies with local details,
the Global-Local State Space Block (GLSSB) synergistically integrates window
self-attention operations with SSM-based feature propagation, enabling
high-frequency detail recovery under global dependency guidance. Extensive
experiments validate MambaVSR's superiority, outperforming the
Transformer-based method by 0.58 dB PSNR on the REDS dataset with 55% fewer
parameters.

TL;DR: CLIPFUSION是一种结合判别式和生成式基础模型的方法，用于解决异常检测中的复杂问题，如数据稀缺和异常多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测因异常定义的模糊性、异常类型的多样性以及训练数据的稀缺性而复杂化，需要一种能同时捕捉低层和高层特征的模型。

Method: CLIPFUSION结合了基于CLIP的判别式模型（捕捉全局特征）和基于扩散的生成式模型（捕捉局部细节），并利用扩散模型的交叉注意力图和特征图进行异常检测。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA等基准数据集上，CLIPFUSION在异常分割和分类任务中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CLIPFUSION展示了多模态和多模型融合在解决异常检测多面挑战中的有效性，为实际应用提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining
anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and
the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model
capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited
data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both
discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based
discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the
diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a
synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for
utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models
specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets
(MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline
methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and
classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of
multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of
anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.

Result: 在六个超声数据集上，DISCOVR在零样本和线性探测中优于现有方法，分割迁移表现更优。

Conclusion: DISCOVR通过双分支设计和知识蒸馏，显著提升了心脏超声视频的表示学习效果。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved major advances in natural images
and video understanding, but challenges remain in domains like echocardiography
(heart ultrasound) due to subtle anatomical structures, complex temporal
dynamics, and the current lack of domain-specific pre-trained models. Existing
SSL approaches such as contrastive, masked modeling, and clustering-based
methods struggle with high intersample similarity, sensitivity to low PSNR
inputs common in ultrasound, or aggressive augmentations that distort
clinically relevant features. We present DISCOVR (Distilled Image Supervision
for Cross Modal Video Representation), a self-supervised dual branch framework
for cardiac ultrasound video representation learning. DISCOVR combines a
clustering-based video encoder that models temporal dynamics with an online
image encoder that extracts fine-grained spatial semantics. These branches are
connected through a semantic cluster distillation loss that transfers
anatomical knowledge from the evolving image encoder to the video encoder,
enabling temporally coherent representations enriched with fine-grained
semantic understanding. Evaluated on six echocardiography datasets spanning
fetal, pediatric, and adult populations, DISCOVR outperforms both specialized
video anomaly detection methods and state-of-the-art video-SSL baselines in
zero-shot and linear probing setups, and achieves superior segmentation
transfer.

TL;DR: GPLQ是一种高效且有效的ViT量化框架，通过两阶段策略（先量化激活再量化权重）解决了现有PTQ和QAT方法的局限性，显著提升了速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PTQ方法导致精度显著下降，而QAT方法计算成本高、泛化能力差且缺乏开源支持。GPLQ旨在解决这些问题。

Method: GPLQ采用两阶段策略：1）保持权重为FP32，仅用1个epoch量化激活；2）使用PTQ方法量化权重。

Result: GPLQ比现有QAT方法快100倍，内存占用低于FP32训练，4-bit模型在ImageNet和下游任务中表现接近FP32模型。

Conclusion: GPLQ是一种通用、实用且高效的ViT量化框架，显著提升了量化模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) are essential in computer vision but are
computationally intensive, too. Model quantization, particularly to low
bit-widths like 4-bit, aims to alleviate this difficulty, yet existing
Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods
exhibit significant limitations. PTQ often incurs substantial accuracy drop,
while QAT achieves high accuracy but suffers from prohibitive computational
costs, limited generalization to downstream tasks, training instability, and
lacking of open-source codebase. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces General, Practical, and Lightning Quantization (GPLQ), a novel
framework designed for efficient and effective ViT quantization. GPLQ is
founded on two key empirical insights: the paramount importance of activation
quantization and the necessity of preserving the model's original optimization
``basin'' to maintain generalization. Consequently, GPLQ employs a sequential
``activation-first, weights-later'' strategy. Stage 1 keeps weights in FP32
while quantizing activations with a feature mimicking loss in only 1 epoch to
keep it stay in the same ``basin'', thereby preserving generalization. Stage 2
quantizes weights using a PTQ method. As a result, GPLQ is 100x faster than
existing QAT methods, lowers memory footprint to levels even below FP32
training, and achieves 4-bit model performance that is highly competitive with
FP32 models in terms of both accuracy on ImageNet and generalization to diverse
downstream tasks, including fine-grained visual classification and object
detection. We will release an easy-to-use open-source toolkit supporting
multiple vision tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the development of interconnected devices has expanded in
many fields, from infotainment to education and industrial applications. This
trend has been accelerated by the increased number of sensors and accessibility
to powerful hardware and software. One area that significantly benefits from
these advancements is Teleoperated Driving (TD). In this scenario, a controller
drives safely a vehicle from remote leveraging sensors data generated onboard
the vehicle, and exchanged via Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications. In
this work, we tackle the problem of detecting the presence of cars and
pedestrians from point cloud data to enable safe TD operations. More
specifically, we exploit the SELMA dataset, a multimodal, open-source,
synthetic dataset for autonomous driving, that we expanded by including the
ground-truth bounding boxes of 3D objects to support object detection. We
analyze the performance of state-of-the-art compression algorithms and object
detectors under several metrics, including compression efficiency,
(de)compression and inference time, and detection accuracy. Moreover, we
measure the impact of compression and detection on the V2X network in terms of
data rate and latency with respect to 3GPP requirements for TD applications.

Result: 发现高资源语言对微调会损害跨语言性能，并提出平衡多语言微调策略。

Conclusion: 建立了新的VLT评估基准，并提出了改进模型性能的有效策略。

Abstract: Vision-Language Translation (VLT) is a challenging task that requires
accurately recognizing multilingual text embedded in images and translating it
into the target language with the support of visual context. While recent Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multilingual and visual
understanding capabilities, there is a lack of systematic evaluation and
understanding of their performance on VLT. In this work, we present a
comprehensive study of VLT from three key perspectives: data quality, model
architecture, and evaluation metrics. (1) We identify critical limitations in
existing datasets, particularly in semantic and cultural fidelity, and
introduce AibTrans -- a multilingual, parallel, human-verified dataset with
OCR-corrected annotations. (2) We benchmark 11 commercial LVLMs/LLMs and 6
state-of-the-art open-source models across end-to-end and cascaded
architectures, revealing their OCR dependency and contrasting generation versus
reasoning behaviors. (3) We propose Density-Aware Evaluation to address metric
reliability issues under varying contextual complexity, introducing the DA
Score as a more robust measure of translation quality. Building upon these
findings, we establish a new evaluation benchmark for VLT. Notably, we observe
that fine-tuning LVLMs on high-resource language pairs degrades cross-lingual
performance, and we propose a balanced multilingual fine-tuning strategy that
effectively adapts LVLMs to VLT without sacrificing their generalization
ability.

Abstract: Image-based 3D object detection is an inevitable part of autonomous driving
because cheap onboard cameras are already available in most modern cars.
Because of the accurate depth information, currently, most state-of-the-art 3D
object detectors heavily rely on LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a
pipeline which lifts the results of existing vision-based 2D algorithms to 3D
detections using only cameras as a cost-effective alternative to LiDAR. In
contrast to existing approaches, we focus not only on cars but on all types of
road users. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first using a 2D CNN to
process the point cloud for each 2D detection to keep the computational effort
as low as possible. Our evaluation on the challenging KITTI 3D object detection
benchmark shows results comparable to state-of-the-art image-based approaches
while having a runtime of only a third.

Conclusion: SphereDrag为全景图像编辑提供了高效且可控的解决方案，并通过PanoBench标准化评估框架验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Image editing has made great progress on planar images, but panoramic image
editing remains underexplored. Due to their spherical geometry and projection
distortions, panoramic images present three key challenges: boundary
discontinuity, trajectory deformation, and uneven pixel density. To tackle
these issues, we propose SphereDrag, a novel panoramic editing framework
utilizing spherical geometry knowledge for accurate and controllable editing.
Specifically, adaptive reprojection (AR) uses adaptive spherical rotation to
deal with discontinuity; great-circle trajectory adjustment (GCTA) tracks the
movement trajectory more accurate; spherical search region tracking (SSRT)
adaptively scales the search range based on spherical location to address
uneven pixel density. Also, we construct PanoBench, a panoramic editing
benchmark, including complex editing tasks involving multiple objects and
diverse styles, which provides a standardized evaluation framework. Experiments
show that SphereDrag gains a considerable improvement compared with existing
methods in geometric consistency and image quality, achieving up to 10.5%

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: O2Former是一种针对SAR图像中船舶实例分割的改进框架，通过优化查询生成器和方向感知嵌入模块，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的船舶分割在多个领域至关重要，但现有方法因忽略尺度变化、目标密度和模糊边界等问题，导致性能不佳。

Method: O2Former基于Mask2Former改进，引入优化查询生成器（OQG）和多尺度特征交互，以及方向感知嵌入模块（OAEM）增强方向敏感性。

Result: 实验表明，O2Former在SAR船舶数据集上优于现有基线方法，验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: O2Former通过针对性设计解决了SAR图像分割的挑战，为相关应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Instance segmentation of ships in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is
critical for applications such as maritime monitoring, environmental analysis,
and national security. SAR ship images present challenges including scale
variation, object density, and fuzzy target boundary, which are often
overlooked in existing methods, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
work, we propose O2Former, a tailored instance segmentation framework that
extends Mask2Former by fully leveraging the structural characteristics of SAR
imagery. We introduce two key components. The first is the Optimized Query
Generator(OQG). It enables multi-scale feature interaction by jointly encoding
shallow positional cues and high-level semantic information. This improves
query quality and convergence efficiency. The second component is the
Orientation-Aware Embedding Module(OAEM). It enhances directional sensitivity
through direction-aware convolution and polar-coordinate encoding. This
effectively addresses the challenge of uneven target orientations in SAR
scenes. Together, these modules facilitate precise feature alignment from
backbone to decoder and strengthen the model's capacity to capture fine-grained
structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that O2Former outperforms
state of the art instance segmentation baselines, validating its effectiveness
and generalization on SAR ship datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法在多任务协同作用下，实现了几何稳健的图像合成和明确的几何预测。

Abstract: We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view
image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike
prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative
models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry
predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and
formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and
geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry,
we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the
image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch
during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves
synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well
as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh
conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point
cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the
generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity
extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of
unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation
settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for
comprehensive 3D completion. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过线性适配器连接冻结的视觉和语言模型的方法，研究了视觉与语言表征的对齐机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何实现视觉与语言表征的对齐机制仍不清楚。

Method: 使用冻结的大型语言模型（LLM）和视觉变换器（ViT），仅通过训练线性适配器进行视觉指令调优。

Result: 实验表明，视觉表征在LLM的中后期层逐渐与语言表征对齐，揭示了ViT输出与早期LLM层之间的不匹配。

Conclusion: 当前基于适配器的架构可能未最优支持跨模态表征学习，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Effective multimodal reasoning depends on the alignment of visual and
linguistic representations, yet the mechanisms by which vision-language models
(VLMs) achieve this alignment remain poorly understood. We introduce a
methodological framework that deliberately maintains a frozen large language
model (LLM) and a frozen vision transformer (ViT), connected solely by training
a linear adapter during visual instruction tuning. This design is fundamental
to our approach: by keeping the language model frozen, we ensure it maintains
its original language representations without adaptation to visual data.
Consequently, the linear adapter must map visual features directly into the
LLM's existing representational space rather than allowing the language model
to develop specialized visual understanding through fine-tuning. Our
experimental design uniquely enables the use of pre-trained sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) of the LLM as analytical probes. These SAEs remain perfectly aligned
with the unchanged language model and serve as a snapshot of the learned
language feature-representations. Through systematic analysis of SAE
reconstruction error, sparsity patterns, and feature SAE descriptions, we
reveal the layer-wise progression through which visual representations
gradually align with language feature representations, converging in
middle-to-later layers. This suggests a fundamental misalignment between ViT
outputs and early LLM layers, raising important questions about whether current
adapter-based architectures optimally facilitate cross-modal representation
learning.

Result: 在标准基准测试中优于基线提示方法，并揭示数据集偏差。

Conclusion: TGT框架通过测试时缩放和动态推理深度调整，显著提升了放射学报告的生成质量。

Abstract: Test-time scaling offers a promising way to improve the reasoning performance
of vision-language large models (VLLMs) without additional training. In this
paper, we explore a simple but effective approach for applying test-time
scaling to radiology report generation. Specifically, we introduce a
lightweight Thought Graph Traversal (TGT) framework that guides the model to
reason through organ-specific findings in a medically coherent order. This
framework integrates structured medical priors into the prompt, enabling deeper
and more logical analysis with no changes to the underlying model. To further
enhance reasoning depth, we apply a reasoning budget forcing strategy that
adjusts the model's inference depth at test time by dynamically extending its
generation process. This simple yet powerful combination allows a frozen
radiology VLLM to self-correct and generate more accurate, consistent chest
X-ray reports. Our method outperforms baseline prompting approaches on standard
benchmarks, and also reveals dataset biases through traceable reasoning paths.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型多模态推理模型VGR，通过增强细粒度视觉感知能力，解决了现有方法在语言空间推理中的局限性，并在多模态基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖语言空间推理，存在语言偏见且局限于数学或科学领域，难以处理需要全面理解图像细节的复杂视觉推理任务。

Method: VGR通过检测相关图像区域并基于这些区域提供精确答案，结合视觉定位和语言推理的大规模SFT数据集VGR-SFT进行训练。

Result: VGR在LLaVA-NeXT-7B基准上表现优异，仅使用30%的图像标记数，在MMStar、AI2D和ChartQA上分别提升了4.1、7.1和12.9分。

Conclusion: VGR通过结合视觉定位和语言推理，显著提升了多模态理解能力，为复杂视觉推理任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In the field of multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, existing
approaches predominantly rely on reasoning on pure language space, which
inherently suffers from language bias and is largely confined to math or
science domains. This narrow focus limits their ability to handle complex
visual reasoning tasks that demand comprehensive understanding of image
details. To address these limitations, this paper introduces VGR, a novel
reasoning multimodal large language model (MLLM) with enhanced fine-grained
visual perception capabilities. Unlike traditional MLLMs that answer the
question or reasoning solely on the language space, our VGR first detects
relevant regions that may help to solve problems, and then provides precise
answers based on replayed image regions. To achieve this, we conduct a
large-scale SFT dataset called VGR -SFT that contains reasoning data with mixed
vision grounding and language deduction. The inference pipeline of VGR allows
the model to choose bounding boxes for visual reference and a replay stage is
introduced to integrates the corresponding regions into the reasoning process,
enhancing multimodel comprehension. Experiments on the LLaVA-NeXT-7B baseline
show that VGR achieves superior performance on multi-modal benchmarks requiring
comprehensive image detail understanding. Compared to the baseline, VGR uses
only 30\% of the image token count while delivering scores of +4.1 on MMStar,
+7.1 on AI2D, and a +12.9 improvement on ChartQA.

Motivation: 通过术前CT提取的身体组成指标，结合临床变量或现有风险预测工具，提高结肠切除术后结果的预测准确性。

Method: 使用Cox比例风险模型评估1年死亡率预测性能（C-index和IBS），逻辑回归评估次要结果（AUC和Brier Score），提取300多个CT特征。

Result: 研究发现术前CT提取的身体组成指标可能对预测术后结果（如死亡率、并发症等）有潜在价值。

Conclusion: 术前CT身体组成指标可作为结肠切除术后结果的预测工具，可能改善临床决策。

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate whether preoperative body composition metrics
automatically extracted from CT scans can predict postoperative outcomes after
colectomy, either alone or combined with clinical variables or existing risk
predictors. Main outcomes and measures: The primary outcome was the predictive
performance for 1-year all-cause mortality following colectomy. A Cox
proportional hazards model with 1-year follow-up was used, and performance was
evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and Integrated Brier Score
(IBS). Secondary outcomes included postoperative complications, unplanned
readmission, blood transfusion, and severe infection, assessed using AUC and
Brier Score from logistic regression. Odds ratios (OR) described associations
between individual CT-derived body composition metrics and outcomes. Over 300
features were extracted from preoperative CTs across multiple vertebral levels,
including skeletal muscle area, density, fat areas, and inter-tissue metrics.
NSQIP scores were available for all surgeries after 2012.

Result: 模型在现有2D和3D基准测试中表现良好，并展现出开放词汇跨域泛化的有效性。

Conclusion: Affogato数据集为交互式对象区域定位提供了新基准，模型表现优异且具有泛化能力。

Abstract: Affordance grounding-localizing object regions based on natural language
descriptions of interactions-is a critical challenge for enabling intelligent
agents to understand and interact with their environments. However, this task
remains challenging due to the need for fine-grained part-level localization,
the ambiguity arising from multiple valid interaction regions, and the scarcity
of large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce Affogato, a large-scale
benchmark comprising 150K instances, annotated with open-vocabulary text
descriptions and corresponding 3D affordance heatmaps across a diverse set of
objects and interactions. Building on this benchmark, we develop simple yet
effective vision-language models that leverage pretrained part-aware vision
backbones and a text-conditional heatmap decoder. Our models trained with the
Affogato dataset achieve promising performance on the existing 2D and 3D
benchmarks, and notably, exhibit effectiveness in open-vocabulary cross-domain
generalization. The Affogato dataset is shared in public:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2DGS在训练和渲染采样率不一致时会出现严重锯齿，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 引入世界空间平滑核和对象空间Mip滤波器，约束频率内容并优化抗锯齿处理。

Result: AA-2DGS显著减少了高频伪影，提升了多尺度渲染质量。

Conclusion: AA-2DGS在保持几何优势的同时，有效解决了2DGS的抗锯齿问题。

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has recently emerged as a promising method for
novel view synthesis and surface reconstruction, offering better
view-consistency and geometric accuracy than volumetric 3DGS. However, 2DGS
suffers from severe aliasing artifacts when rendering at different sampling
rates than those used during training, limiting its practical applications in
scenarios requiring camera zoom or varying fields of view. We identify that
these artifacts stem from two key limitations: the lack of frequency
constraints in the representation and an ineffective screen-space clamping
approach. To address these issues, we present AA-2DGS, an antialiased
formulation of 2D Gaussian Splatting that maintains its geometric benefits
while significantly enhancing rendering quality across different scales. Our
method introduces a world space flat smoothing kernel that constrains the
frequency content of 2D Gaussian primitives based on the maximal sampling
frequency from training views, effectively eliminating high-frequency artifacts
when zooming in. Additionally, we derive a novel object space Mip filter by
leveraging an affine approximation of the ray-splat intersection mapping, which
allows us to efficiently apply proper anti-aliasing directly in the local space
of each splat.

Motivation: 提升现有GPU光线追踪实现的性能，尤其是对二次射线的处理。

Method: 提出一种基于终止点估计的射线重排序方法，适用于二次射线，并在RTX内核中评估。

Result: 射线重排序显著提升追踪速度（1.3-2.0倍），但硬件加速阶段的排序开销难以完全抵消。

Conclusion: 射线重排序能有效提升性能，但需进一步优化以完全抵消其开销。

Abstract: We study ray reordering as a tool for increasing the performance of existing
GPU ray tracing implementations. We focus on ray reordering that is fully
agnostic to the particular trace kernel. We summarize the existing methods for
computing the ray sorting keys and discuss their properties. We propose a novel
modification of a previously proposed method using the termination point
estimation that is well-suited to tracing secondary rays. We evaluate the ray
reordering techniques in the context of the wavefront path tracing using the
RTX trace kernels. We show that ray reordering yields significantly higher
trace speed on recent GPUs (1.3-2.0x), but to recover the reordering overhead
in the hardware-accelerated trace phase is problematic.

Result: GPU实现性能比常规网格提升高达30倍，能以32样本/像素实时渲染生产级资产。

Conclusion: 四面体网格在体积数据渲染中具有显著优势，适用于高性能实时应用。

Abstract: We advertise the use of tetrahedral grids constructed via the longest edge
bisection algorithm for rendering volumetric data with path tracing. The key
benefits of such grids is two-fold. First, they provide a highly adaptive
space-partitioning representation that limits the memory footprint of
volumetric assets. Second, each (tetrahedral) cell has exactly 4 neighbors
within the volume (one per face of each tetrahedron) or less at boundaries. We
leverage these properties to devise optimized algorithms and data-structures to
compute and path-trace adaptive tetrahedral grids on the GPU. In practice, our
GPU implementation outperforms regular grids by up to x30 and renders
production assets in real time at 32 samples per pixel.

Method: 构建了一个包含多种高级渲染技术失真的视频质量数据集，并基于预训练的3D CNN特征空间，提出了CGVQM质量评估指标。

Result: 现有全参考质量指标在这些失真上表现不佳（最大Pearson相关性0.78），CGVQM显著优于现有指标，并提供像素级误差图和全局质量分数。

Conclusion: CGVQM在评估现代渲染失真方面表现优异，数据集和指标实现已开源。

Abstract: While existing video and image quality datasets have extensively studied
natural videos and traditional distortions, the perception of synthetic content
and modern rendering artifacts remains underexplored. We present a novel video
quality dataset focused on distortions introduced by advanced rendering
techniques, including neural supersampling, novel-view synthesis, path tracing,
neural denoising, frame interpolation, and variable rate shading. Our
evaluations show that existing full-reference quality metrics perform
sub-optimally on these distortions, with a maximum Pearson correlation of 0.78.
Additionally, we find that the feature space of pre-trained 3D CNNs aligns
strongly with human perception of visual quality. We propose CGVQM, a
full-reference video quality metric that significantly outperforms existing
metrics while generating both per-pixel error maps and global quality scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线讨论规模大、速度快，版主难以跟踪多线程对话并保持上下文理解，现有平台（如Reddit）的嵌套线程结构仍难以清晰展示讨论轨迹。

Method: 开发了Needle系统，利用视觉分析技术总结关键对话指标（如活动、毒性水平和投票趋势），并提供高低层次的分析。

Result: 用户研究表明，Needle能降低版主的认知负担，帮助优先处理需关注的区域，并提供决策支持。

Conclusion: Needle是首个将交互式视觉分析与人工审核结合的线程讨论系统，为未来可视化驱动的审核工具提供了设计指南。

Abstract: Navigating large-scale online discussions is difficult due to the rapid pace
and large volume of user-generated content. Prior work in CSCW has shown that
moderators often struggle to follow multiple simultaneous discussions, track
evolving conversations, and maintain contextual understanding--all of which
hinder timely and effective moderation. While platforms like Reddit use
threaded structures to organize discourse, deeply nested threads can still
obscure discussions and make it difficult to grasp the overall trajectory of
conversations. In this paper, we present an interactive system called Needle to
support better navigation and comprehension of complex discourse within
threaded discussions. Needle uses visual analytics to summarize key
conversational metrics--such as activity, toxicity levels, and voting
trends--over time, offering both high-level insights and detailed breakdowns of
discussion threads. Through a user study with ten Reddit moderators, we find
that Needle supports moderation by reducing cognitive load in making sense of
large discussion, helping prioritize areas that need attention, and providing
decision-making supports. Based on our findings, we provide a set of design
guidelines to inform future visualization-driven moderation tools and
sociotechnical systems. To the best of our knowledge, Needle is one of the
first systems to combine interactive visual analytics with human-in-the-loop
moderation for threaded online discussions.

Motivation: 项目式学习在计算教育中很重要，但其开放性使得项目跟踪和评估成功具有挑战性。

Method: 使用对话转录的语言特征和系统日志的行为特征预测项目质量的三个指标：生产力、内容丰富度和词汇多样性。

Result: 日志数据预测生产力更优，对话数据预测内容丰富度更优，多模态融合对生产力和词汇多样性有提升。

Conclusion: 多模态融合的价值取决于具体学习效果，研究为多模态学习分析提供了新见解。

Abstract: Project-based learning plays a crucial role in computing education. However,
its open-ended nature makes tracking project development and assessing success
challenging. We investigate how dialogue and system interaction logs predict
project quality during collaborative, project-based AI learning of 94 middle
school students working in pairs. We used linguistic features from dialogue
transcripts and behavioral features from system logs to predict three project
quality outcomes: productivity (number of training phrases), content richness
(word density), and lexical variation (word diversity) of chatbot training
phrases. We compared the predictive accuracy of each modality and a fusion of
the modalities. Results indicate log data better predicts productivity, while
dialogue data is more effective for content richness. Both modalities modestly
predict lexical variation. Multimodal fusion improved predictions for
productivity and lexical variation of training phrases but not content
richness. These findings suggest that the value of multimodal fusion depends on
the specific learning outcome. The study contributes to multimodal learning
analytics by demonstrating the nuanced interplay between behavioral and
linguistic data in assessing student learning progress in open-ended AI
learning environments.

Abstract: Despite a growing need for spiritual care in the US, it is often
under-served, inaccessible, or misunderstood, while almost no prior work in
CSCW/HCI research has engaged with professional chaplains and spiritual care
providers. This interdisciplinary study aims to develop a foundational
understanding of how spiritual care may (or may not) be expanded into online
spaces -- especially focusing on anonymous, asynchronous, and text-based online
communities. We conducted an exploratory mixed-methods study with chaplains
(N=22) involving interviews and user testing sessions centered around Reddit
support communities to understand participants' perspectives on technology and
their ideations about the role of chaplaincy in prospective Online Spiritual
Care Communities (OSCCs). Our Grounded Theory Method analysis highlighted
benefits of OSCCs including: meeting patients where they are at; accessibility
and scalability; and facilitating patient-initiated care. Chaplains highlighted
how their presence in OSCCs could help with shaping peer interactions,
moderation, synchronous chats for group care, and redirecting to external
resources, while also raising important feasibility concerns, risks, and needs
for future design and research. We used an existing taxonomy of chaplaincy
techniques to show that some spiritual care strategies may be amenable to
online spaces, yet we also exposed the limitations of technology to fully
mediate spiritual care and the need to develop new online chaplaincy
interventions. Based on these findings, we contribute the model of a ``Care
Loop'' between institutionally-based formal care and platform-based community
care to expand access and drive greater awareness and utilization of spiritual
care. We also contribute design implications to guide future work in online
spiritual care.

use of an AI-driven chatbot to support culturally competent communication
training for medical students. The chatbot was designed to simulate realistic
patient conversations and provide structured feedback based on the ACT Cultural
Competence model. We piloted the chatbot with a small group of third-year
medical students at a UK medical school in 2024. Although we did not follow a
formal experimental design, our experience suggests that the chatbot offered
useful opportunities for students to reflect on their communication,
particularly around empathy and interpersonal understanding. More challenging
areas included addressing systemic issues and historical context. Although this
early version of the chatbot helped surface some interesting patterns,
limitations were also clear, such as the absence of nonverbal cues and the
tendency for virtual patients to be overly agreeable. In general, this
reflection highlights both the potential and the current limitations of AI
tools in communication training. More work is needed to better understand their
impact and improve the learning experience.

### [121] [Do Not Immerse and Drive? Prolonged Effects of Cybersickness on Physiological Stress Markers And Cognitive Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11536)
*Daniel Zielasko,Ben Rehling,Bernadette von Dawans,Gregor Domes*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了VR引起的晕动症（cybersickness）对生理压力和工作记忆的延迟影响，发现症状和压力指标显著增加，且恢复期较长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟现实（VR）长时间暴露可能导致晕动症，进而引发生理压力和认知功能下降，需研究其延迟效应。

Method: 通过旋转木马模拟诱发晕动症，评估主观不适（SSQ、FMS）、生理压力（唾液皮质醇、α-淀粉酶、皮肤电活动、心率）和工作记忆（n-Back任务）在90分钟内的变化。

Result: VR暴露后主观和生理压力指标显著上升，工作记忆下降；部分参与者症状延迟至90分钟达到峰值，唾液皮质醇持续升高。

Conclusion: 研究强调XR研究需延长恢复期，并对VR专业应用的安全性提出警示。

Abstract: Extended exposure to virtual reality environments can induce motion sickness,
often referred to as cybersickness, which may lead to physiological stress
responses and impaired cognitive performance. This study investigates the
aftereffects of VR-induced motion sickness with a focus on physiological stress
markers and working memory performance. Using a carousel simulation to elicit
cybersickness, we assessed subjective discomfort (SSQ, FMS), physiological
stress (salivary cortisol, alpha-amylase, electrodermal activity, heart rate),
and cognitive performance (n-Back task) over a 90-minute post-exposure period.
Our findings demonstrate a significant increase in both subjective and
physiological stress indicators following VR exposure, accompanied by a decline
in working memory performance. Notably, delayed symptom progression was
observed in a substantial proportion of participants, with some reporting peak
symptoms up to 90 minutes post-stimulation. Salivary cortisol levels remained
elevated throughout the observation period, indicating prolonged stress
recovery. These results highlight the need for longer washout phases in XR
research and raise safety concerns for professional applications involving
post-exposure task performance.

*Daniel Hove Paludan,Julie Fredsgård,Kasper Patrick Bährentz,Ilhan Aslan*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究探讨了数字技术如何通过对话式AI和选择型响应格式提升客户与设计师在需求收集阶段的协作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 客户与设计师的协作对设计项目至关重要，但数字技术对此的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 分三阶段研究：访谈10家设计公司、50名模拟客户测试2x2因子设计、7家公司反馈系统价值。

Result: 对话式AI和选择型响应降低了用户体验问卷的可靠性评分，但提高了客户输入的清晰度。

Conclusion: 为早期客户-设计师协作提供了整合对话式AI和选择型响应的设计启示。

Abstract: Client-designer alignment is crucial to the success of design projects, yet
little research has explored how digital technologies might influence this
alignment. To address this gap, this paper presents a three-phase study
investigating how digital systems can support requirements elicitation in
professional design practice. Specifically, it examines how integrating a
conversational agent and choice-based response formats into a digital
elicitation tool affects early-stage client-designer collaboration. The first
phase of the study inquired into the current practices of 10 design companies
through semi-structured interviews, informing the system's design. The second
phase evaluated the system using a 2x2 factorial design with 50 mock clients,
quantifying the effects of conversational AI and response type on user
experience and perceived preparedness. In phase three, the system was presented
to seven of the original 10 companies to gather reflections on its value,
limitations, and potential integration into practice. Findings show that both
conversational AI and choice-based responses lead to lower dependability scores
on the User Experience Questionnaire, yet result in client input with greater
clarity. We contribute design implications for integrating conversational AI
and choice-based responses into elicitation tools to support mutual
understanding in early-stage client-designer collaboration.

TL;DR: 研究比较了德国奶农和软件提供商对数字决策支持系统解释格式的看法，发现软件提供商的假设与奶农实际偏好存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨奶农对数字系统解释格式的需求，以及软件提供商是否准确理解这些需求，以改善系统采纳率。

Method: 设计了四种解释格式（文本、规则、群体比较、时间序列），分别调查奶农和软件提供商的评价。

Result: 软件提供商的假设与奶农实际偏好不一致，表明用户需求分析的重要性。

Conclusion: 需更深入的用户需求分析以提高软件适应性和用户接受度。

Abstract: This paper examines the views of software providers in the German dairy
industry with regard to dairy farmers' needs for explanation of digital
decision support systems. The study is based on mastitis detection in dairy
cows using a hypothetical herd management system. We designed four exemplary
explanation formats for mastitis assessments with different types of
presentation (textual, rule-based, herd comparison, and time series). In our
previous study, 14 dairy farmers in Germany had rated these formats in terms of
comprehensibility and the trust they would have in a system providing each
format. In this study, we repeat the survey with 13 software providers active
in the German dairy industry. We ask them how well they think the formats would
be received by farmers. We hypothesized that there may be discrepancies between
the views of both groups that are worth investigating, partly to find reasons
for the reluctance to adopt digital systems. A comparison of the feedback from
both groups supports the hypothesis and calls for further investigation. The
results show that software providers tend to make assumptions about farmers'
preferences that are not necessarily accurate. Our study, although not
representative due to the small sample size, highlights the potential benefits
of a thorough user requirements analysis (farmers' needs) to improve software
adaptation and user acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI工具虽然能力增强，但碎片化严重，无法实现持续的协作。

Method: 提出一个三层框架，明确、可检查和可适应的流程设计。

Result: 该框架统一了现有系统设计方法，揭示了新的研究机会。

Conclusion: 通过结构化协作，重新构想人机协作为一个连贯、对齐的系统。

Abstract: As AI tools proliferate across domains, from chatbots and copilots to
emerging agents, they increasingly support professional knowledge work. Yet
despite their growing capabilities, these systems remain fragmented: they
assist with isolated tasks but lack the architectural scaffolding for
sustained, adaptive collaboration. We propose a layered framework for
human-agent systems that integrates three interdependent dimensions:
interaction, process, and infrastructure. Crucially, our architecture elevates
process to a primary focus by making it explicit, inspectable, and adaptable,
enabling humans and agents to align with evolving goals and coordinate over
time. This model clarifies limitations of current tools, unifies emerging
system design approaches, and reveals new opportunities for researchers and AI
system builders. By grounding intelligent behavior in structured collaboration,
we reimagine human-agent collaboration not as task-specific augmentation, but
as a form of coherent and aligned system for real-world work.

TL;DR: GeoPandas-AI通过将LLMs集成到GeoPandas工作流中，简化了地理空间数据分析，降低了使用门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GeoPandas等工具需要专业知识的问题，使地理空间数据分析更易用。

Method: 设计并实现了一个智能的GeoDataFrame类，结合LLMs进行代码生成和数据分析。

Result: 开源了GeoPandas-AI的PyPI实现，提供了一种新的代码辅助范式。

Conclusion: GeoPandas-AI为地理空间开发提供了一种创新的、对话式的工作方式。

Abstract: Geospatial data analysis plays a crucial role in tackling intricate societal
challenges such as urban planning and climate modeling. However, employing
tools like GeoPandas, a prominent Python library for geospatial data
manipulation, necessitates expertise in complex domain-specific syntax and
workflows. GeoPandas-AI addresses this gap by integrating LLMs directly into
the GeoPandas workflow, transforming the GeoDataFrame class into an
intelligent, stateful class for both data analysis and geospatial code
development. This paper formalizes the design of such a smart class and
provides an open-source implementation of GeoPandas-AI in PyPI package manager.
Through its innovative combination of conversational interfaces and stateful
exploitation of LLMs for code generation and data analysis, GeoPandas-AI
introduces a new paradigm for code-copilots and instantiates it for geospatial
development.

Conclusion: 论文为理解数字劳动在AI生态系统中的作用提供了批判性视角，并指出了未来干预和研究的方向。

Abstract: Digital workers on crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Amazon Mechanical Turk,
Appen, Clickworker, Prolific) play a crucial role in training and improving AI
systems, yet they often face low pay, unfair conditions, and a lack of
recognition for their contributions. To map these issues in the existing
literature of computer science, AI, and related scholarship, we selected over
300 research papers on digital labor published between 2015 and 2024, narrowing
them down to 143 on digital gig-labor for a detailed analysis. This analysis
provides a broad overview of the key challenges, concerns, and trends in the
field. Our synthesis reveals how the persistent patterns of representation and
voices of gig workers in digital labor are structured and governed. We offer
new insights for researchers, platform designers, and policymakers, helping
them better understand the experiences of digital workers and pointing to key
areas where interventions and future investigations are promptly needed. By
mapping the findings from the past ten years' growth of the domain and possible
implications, this paper contributes to a more coherent and critical
understanding of digital labor in contemporary and future AI ecosystems.

Result: 88%的受访者已使用LLMs进行学习，年轻人是主要用户。研究发现了四种学习者类型，并揭示了用户对LLMs准确性和隐私保护的矛盾态度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多样化学习媒介、协作学习、满足不同学习者需求以及设计导向学习的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models have not only captivated the public imagination but
have also sparked a profound rethinking of how we learn. In the third year
following the breakthrough launch of ChatGPT, everyday informal learning has
been transformed as diverse user groups explore these novel tools. Who is
embracing LLMs for self-directed learning, and who remains hesitant? What are
their reasons for adoption or avoidance? What learning patterns emerge with
this novel technological landscape? We present an in-depth analysis from a
large-scale survey of 776 participants, showcasing that 88% of our respondents
already incorporate LLMs into their everyday learning routines for a wide
variety of (learning) tasks. Young adults are at the forefront of adopting
LLMs, primarily to enhance their learning experiences independently of time and
space. Four types of learners emerge across learning contexts, depending on the
tasks they perform with LLMs and the devices they use to access them.
Interestingly, our respondents exhibit paradoxical behaviours regarding their
trust in LLMs' accuracy and privacy protection measures. Our implications
emphasize the importance of including different media types for learning,
enabling collaborative learning, providing sources and meeting the needs of
different types of learners and learning by design.

Result: 研究表明，渐进式真实度能有效降低新手教师的认知负荷，同时提出了一种高效的技术实现方案。

Conclusion: 论文强调教学需求应优先于技术追求，为下一代AI模拟器设计提供了基于证据的原则。

Abstract: Virtual Reality simulators offer a powerful tool for teacher training, yet
the integration of AI-powered student avatars presents a critical challenge:
determining the optimal level of avatar realism for effective pedagogy. This
literature review examines the evolution of avatar realism in VR teacher
training, synthesizes its theoretical implications, and proposes a new
pedagogical framework to guide future design. Through a systematic review, this
paper traces the progression from human-controlled avatars to generative AI
prototypes. Applying learning theories like Cognitive Load Theory, we argue
that hyper-realism is not always optimal, as high-fidelity avatars can impose
excessive extraneous cognitive load on novices, a stance supported by recent
empirical findings. A significant gap exists between the technological drive
for photorealism and the pedagogical need for scaffolded learning. To address
this gap, we propose Graduated Realism, a framework advocating for starting
trainees with lower-fidelity avatars and progressively increasing behavioral
complexity as skills develop. To make this computationally feasible, we outline
a novel single-call architecture, Crazy Slots, which uses a probabilistic
engine and a Retrieval-Augmented Generation database to generate authentic,
real-time responses without the latency and cost of multi-step reasoning
models. This review provides evidence-based principles for designing the next
generation of AI simulators, arguing that a pedagogically grounded approach to
realism is essential for creating scalable and effective teacher education
tools.

Motivation: 阅读障碍影响全球10%至20%的人口，严重损害学习能力，亟需创新且易获取的诊断方法。

Method: 通过分析眼动模式（如注视时间和异常扫视），提出改进的眼动追踪特征提取方法，并利用随机森林分类器进行诊断，同时采用层次聚类方法识别阅读障碍的严重程度。

Result: 随机森林分类器实现了88.58%的准确率，层次聚类方法成功区分了不同严重程度的阅读障碍。

Conclusion: 结合眼动追踪和机器学习为非侵入式诊断提供了高准确性和可及性，是临床研究中的重大进步。

Abstract: Dyslexia, affecting an estimated 10% to 20% of the global population,
significantly impairs learning capabilities, highlighting the need for
innovative and accessible diagnostic methods. This paper investigates the
effectiveness of eye-tracking technology combined with machine learning
algorithms as a cost-effective alternative for early dyslexia detection. By
analyzing general eye movement patterns, including prolonged fixation durations
and erratic saccades, we proposed an enhanced solution for determining
eye-tracking-based dyslexia features. A Random Forest Classifier was then
employed to detect dyslexia, achieving an accuracy of 88.58\%. Additionally,
hierarchical clustering methods were applied to identify varying severity
levels of dyslexia. The analysis incorporates diverse methodologies across
various populations and settings, demonstrating the potential of this
technology to identify individuals with dyslexia, including those with
borderline traits, through non-invasive means. Integrating eye-tracking with
machine learning represents a significant advancement in the diagnostic
process, offering a highly accurate and accessible method in clinical research.

Conclusion: 建议通过严格评估数据发现的有用性来缓解计算与基础数据科学的分歧，促进数据科学的健康发展。

Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term
essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions
stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D
complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with
the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific
goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical
organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges
that are defined according to the missions. We define specific
discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of
pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with
the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science
into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat
of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially,
if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be
useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of
data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式训练的基础模型存在隐私和传输成本问题，而现有的PFL研究多局限于模拟环境，忽视了真实场景中的数据与模型异构性。

Method: 提出任务相似性感知的模型聚合方法以应对数据异构性，以及维度不变模块以支持异构模型间的知识共享。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在个性化和泛化能力上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为多模态PFL提供了有效解决方案，适用于真实世界中的异构场景。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities across diverse
multi-modal tasks, but their centralized training raises privacy concerns and
induces high transmission costs. In contrast, federated learning (FL) offers a
distributed alternative without the need to share data. Recently, for the
growing demand for personalizing AI models for different user purposes,
personalized federated learning (PFL) has emerged. PFL allows each client to
leverage the knowledge of other clients for further adaptation to individual
user preferences, again without the need to share data. Despite its potential,
most PFL studies remain confined to simulated environments, overlooking the
data and model heterogeneity that arise in real-world scenarios. In contrast,
we first consider large data heterogeneity, evaluating on a new benchmark for
multi-modal PFL, spanning 40 distinct tasks with realistic data distribution
shifts. We then consider model heterogeneity in that we do not assume that all
clients share similar model architectures. To address data heterogeneity, we
propose a task-similarity-aware model aggregation method that provides
customized global models to each client. For model heterogeneity, we propose a
dimension-invariant module that enables knowledge sharing across heterogeneous
models. Empirical validations demonstrate that the proposed approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art, excelling in both personalization and
generalization capabilities.

Abstract: This paper examines how synthetically generated faces and machine
learning-based gender classification algorithms are affected by algorithmic
lookism, the preferential treatment based on appearance. In experiments with
13,200 synthetically generated faces, we find that: (1) text-to-image (T2I)
systems tend to associate facial attractiveness to unrelated positive traits
like intelligence and trustworthiness; and (2) gender classification models
exhibit higher error rates on "less-attractive" faces, especially among
non-White women. These result raise fairness concerns regarding digital
identity systems.

Method: 对比评估四种合成数据生成方法（WGAN、CTGAN、扩散模型和高斯噪声增强），分析其分类效用、分布保真度和隐私泄漏。

Result: 扩散模型分类效用最高（宏F1达88.2%），CTGAN对重建攻击抵抗力最强。

Conclusion: 结构化生成模型在开发隐私保护的数据驱动能源系统中具有潜力。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of dynamic Time-of-Use (dToU) electricity tariffs
requires accurately identifying households that would benefit from such pricing
structures. However, the use of real consumption data poses serious privacy
concerns, motivating the adoption of synthetic alternatives. In this study, we
conduct a comparative evaluation of four synthetic data generation methods,
Wasserstein-GP Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN), Conditional Tabular GAN
(CTGAN), Diffusion Models, and Gaussian noise augmentation, under different
synthetic regimes. We assess classification utility, distribution fidelity, and
privacy leakage. Our results show that architectural design plays a key role:
diffusion models achieve the highest utility (macro-F1 up to 88.2%), while
CTGAN provide the strongest resistance to reconstruction attacks. These
findings highlight the potential of structured generative models for developing
privacy-preserving, data-driven energy systems.

Result: 实验证明，该方法在数学逻辑问题基准测试中显著提升了推理质量、代码准确性和逻辑正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为缺乏训练资源的编程语言提供了一种有效的代码生成解决方案。

Abstract: Generating accurate and executable code using large language models (LLMs) is
challenging for languages with limited public training data compared to popular
languages such as Python. This paper introduces a generalizable approach that
uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through
explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with
smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case --
given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in
generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully
produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly
integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop.
Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate
significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical
correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide
range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.

Result: 移动数据和GCN模块对预测性能提升有限，但死亡和住院数据显著提高准确性。空间地图与封锁令存在相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为传染病预测中的移动性表示提供了新视角，有助于决策者更好地应对未来疫情。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of contagious disease outbreaks is vital for informed
decision-making. Our study addresses the gap between machine learning
algorithms and their epidemiological applications, noting that methods optimal
for benchmark datasets often underperform with real-world data due to
difficulties in incorporating mobility information. We adopt a two-phase
approach: first, assessing the significance of mobility data through a pilot
study, then evaluating the impact of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on a
transformer backbone. Our findings reveal that while mobility data and GCN
modules do not significantly enhance forecasting performance, the inclusion of
mortality and hospitalization data markedly improves model accuracy.
Additionally, a comparative analysis between GCN-derived spatial maps and
lockdown orders suggests a notable correlation, highlighting the potential of
spatial maps as sensitive indicators for mobility. Our research offers a novel
perspective on mobility representation in predictive modeling for contagious
diseases, empowering decision-makers to better prepare for future outbreaks.

Conclusion: YingLong框架在时间序列预测中实现了先进性能，展示了非因果方法的潜力。

Abstract: We present a joint forecasting framework for time series prediction that
contrasts with traditional direct or recursive methods. This framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance for our designed foundation model, YingLong, and
reveals a novel scaling effect: longer outputs significantly enhance model
accuracy due to delayed chain-of-thought reasoning in our non-causal approach.
YingLong is a non-causal, bidirectional attention encoder-only transformer
trained through masked token recovery, aligning more effectively with language
understanding tasks than with generation tasks. Additionally, we boost
performance by tackling output variance with a multi-input ensemble. We release
four foundation models ranging from 6M to 300M parameters, demonstrating
superior results in zero-shot tasks on the ETT and Weather datasets. YingLong
achieves more than 60% best performance. To ensure generalizability, we
assessed the models using the GIFT-Eval benchmark, which comprises 23 time
series datasets across 7 domains. Yinglong significantly outperformed the best
time-series foundation models, end-to-end trained models by 14% and 44% in rank
respectively.The pretrained 300M model is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FTP（Forward Target Propagation）的生物合理且计算高效的方法，替代传统的反向传播（BP），通过前向计算实现局部学习，并在多种任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反向传播（BP）在生物和硬件视角存在局限性，如对称权重、非局部信用分配等问题，需要一种更高效且生物合理的方法。

Method: FTP通过两次前向传递替代反向传播，仅使用前向计算估计层间目标，无需对称反馈权重或可逆函数。

Result: FTP在MNIST、CIFAR10和CIFAR100等任务中与BP竞争，且在低精度和硬件约束下表现更优，效率高于其他生物启发方法。

Conclusion: FTP因其计算高效、前向特性和硬件兼容性，为节能设备学习和神经形态计算提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Training neural networks has traditionally relied on backpropagation (BP), a
gradient-based algorithm that, despite its widespread success, suffers from key
limitations in both biological and hardware perspectives. These include
backward error propagation by symmetric weights, non-local credit assignment,
and frozen activity during backward passes. We propose Forward Target
Propagation (FTP), a biologically plausible and computationally efficient
alternative that replaces the backward pass with a second forward pass. FTP
estimates layerwise targets using only feedforward computations, eliminating
the need for symmetric feedback weights or learnable inverse functions, hence
enabling modular and local learning. We evaluate FTP on fully connected
networks, CNNs, and RNNs, demonstrating accuracies competitive with BP on
MNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100, as well as effective modeling of long-term
dependencies in sequential tasks. Moreover, FTP outperforms BP under quantized
low-precision and emerging hardware constraints while also demonstrating
substantial efficiency gains over other biologically inspired methods such as
target propagation variants and forward-only learning algorithms. With its
minimal computational overhead, forward-only nature, and hardware
compatibility, FTP provides a promising direction for energy-efficient
on-device learning and neuromorphic computing.

*Zoher Kachwala,Danishjeet Singh,Danielle Yang,Filippo Menczer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于预训练视觉语言模型（VLM）的零样本检测方法（zero-shot-s²），通过任务对齐提示提升AI生成图像的检测性能，无需微调即可显著提高泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像生成器生成的图像越来越逼真，对其潜在滥用的担忧增加。传统监督检测方法依赖大规模标注数据且泛化能力有限，因此探索零样本检测方法具有重要意义。

Method: 利用预训练VLM，通过任务对齐提示（如“Let's examine the style and the synthesis artifacts”）引导模型更专注的推理，无需微调即可提升检测性能。

Result: zero-shot-s²方法在多个开源模型上提升Macro F1分数8%-29%，并在16种生成模型生成的多样数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 任务对齐提示能激发VLM的潜在能力，提供了一种简单、可泛化且可解释的AI生成图像检测替代方案。

Abstract: As image generators produce increasingly realistic images, concerns about
potential misuse continue to grow. Supervised detection relies on large,
curated datasets and struggles to generalize across diverse generators. In this
work, we investigate the use of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for
zero-shot detection of AI-generated images. While off-the-shelf VLMs exhibit
some task-specific reasoning and chain-of-thought prompting offers gains, we
show that task-aligned prompting elicits more focused reasoning and
significantly improves performance without fine-tuning. Specifically, prefixing
the model's response with the phrase ``Let's examine the style and the
synthesis artifacts'' -- a method we call zero-shot-s$^2$ -- boosts Macro F1
scores by 8%-29% for two widely used open-source models. These gains are
consistent across three recent, diverse datasets spanning human faces, objects,
and animals with images generated by 16 different models -- demonstrating
strong generalization. We further evaluate the approach across three additional
model sizes and observe improvements in most dataset-model combinations --
suggesting robustness to model scale. Surprisingly, self-consistency, a
behavior previously observed in language reasoning, where aggregating answers
from diverse reasoning paths improves performance, also holds in this setting.
Even here, zero-shot-s$^2$ scales better than chain-of-thought in most cases --
indicating that it elicits more useful diversity. Our findings show that
task-aligned prompts elicit more focused reasoning and enhance latent
capabilities in VLMs, like the detection of AI-generated images -- offering a
simple, generalizable, and explainable alternative to supervised methods. Our
code is publicly available on github:

TL;DR: 提出了一种运行时防护机制，用于强化学习中隐藏参数变化的安全风险，通过实时推断和预测确保安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐藏参数（如机器人质量分布或摩擦）的变化在执行时可能带来安全风险，需要一种机制来实时适应和约束动作空间。

Method: 基于约束隐藏参数马尔可夫决策过程，利用函数编码器实时推断隐藏参数，并通过共形预测考虑不确定性。防护机制通过预测未来安全风险约束动作空间。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少安全违规，并在分布外泛化中表现优异，同时运行时开销极小。

Conclusion: 提出的机制满足概率安全保证，并在安全合规策略集中实现最优策略。

Abstract: Variations in hidden parameters, such as a robot's mass distribution or
friction, pose safety risks during execution. We develop a runtime shielding
mechanism for reinforcement learning, building on the formalism of constrained
hidden-parameter Markov decision processes. Function encoders enable real-time
inference of hidden parameters from observations, allowing the shield and the
underlying policy to adapt online. The shield constrains the action space by
forecasting future safety risks (such as obstacle proximity) and accounts for
uncertainty via conformal prediction. We prove that the proposed mechanism
satisfies probabilistic safety guarantees and yields optimal policies among the
set of safety-compliant policies. Experiments across diverse environments with
varying hidden parameters show that our method significantly reduces safety
violations and achieves strong out-of-distribution generalization, while
incurring minimal runtime overhead.

TL;DR: TSFMs在建筑能源管理中的泛化能力有限，表现仅略优于统计模型，需进一步改进以提升适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决建筑能源管理中任务和数据特定模型的局限性，探索时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的潜力。

Method: 评估TSFMs在四个维度：零样本单变量预测、协变量预测、零样本表示学习和鲁棒性。

Result: TSFMs在泛化能力上表现有限，协变量未提升性能，分类任务表现较好但预测任务不及统计模型。

Conclusion: 需针对性改进TSFMs设计，特别是协变量处理和上下文整合，以开发更适应BEM的解决方案。

Abstract: Building energy management (BEM) tasks require processing and learning from a
variety of time-series data. Existing solutions rely on bespoke task- and
data-specific models to perform these tasks, limiting their broader
applicability. Inspired by the transformative success of Large Language Models
(LLMs), Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs), trained on diverse datasets,
have the potential to change this. Were TSFMs to achieve a level of
generalizability across tasks and contexts akin to LLMs, they could
fundamentally address the scalability challenges pervasive in BEM. To
understand where they stand today, we evaluate TSFMs across four dimensions:
(1) generalizability in zero-shot univariate forecasting, (2) forecasting with
covariates for thermal behavior modeling, (3) zero-shot representation learning
for classification tasks, and (4) robustness to performance metrics and varying
operational conditions. Our results reveal that TSFMs exhibit \emph{limited}
generalizability, performing only marginally better than statistical models on
unseen datasets and modalities for univariate forecasting. Similarly, inclusion
of covariates in TSFMs does not yield performance improvements, and their
performance remains inferior to conventional models that utilize covariates.
While TSFMs generate effective zero-shot representations for downstream
classification tasks, they may remain inferior to statistical models in
forecasting when statistical models perform test-time fitting. Moreover, TSFMs
forecasting performance is sensitive to evaluation metrics, and they struggle
in more complex building environments compared to statistical models. These
findings underscore the need for targeted advancements in TSFM design,
particularly their handling of covariates and incorporating context and
temporal dynamics into prediction mechanisms, to develop more adaptable and
scalable solutions for BEM.

Method: 构建了包含因果结构推断、干预目标预测和反事实预测三个任务的CausalVLBench，并在三个因果表示学习数据集上评估了LVLMs。

Result: 展示了现有LVLMs在视觉因果推理任务中的基本优势和不足。

Conclusion: 希望该基准能推动改进LVLMs视觉因果推理能力的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in various
language tasks, especially with their emergent in-context learning capability.
Extending LLMs to incorporate visual inputs, large vision-language models
(LVLMs) have shown impressive performance in tasks such as recognition and
visual question answering (VQA). Despite increasing interest in the utility of
LLMs in causal reasoning tasks such as causal discovery and counterfactual
reasoning, there has been relatively little work showcasing the abilities of
LVLMs on visual causal reasoning tasks. We take this opportunity to formally
introduce a comprehensive causal reasoning benchmark for multi-modal in-context
learning from LVLMs. Our CausalVLBench encompasses three representative tasks:
causal structure inference, intervention target prediction, and counterfactual
prediction. We evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs on
our causal reasoning tasks across three causal representation learning datasets
and demonstrate their fundamental strengths and weaknesses. We hope that our
benchmark elucidates the drawbacks of existing vision-language models and
motivates new directions and paradigms in improving the visual causal reasoning
abilities of LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理学研究表明深度学习中常用的几何相似性模型与人类感知不符，而Tversky的特征集相似性理论更符合心理现实性。

Method: 开发了可微分的Tversky相似性参数化方法，并设计了Tversky投影层作为神经网络的构建模块。

Result: 在NABirds图像分类任务中，Tversky投影层相对线性层提升了24.7%的准确率；在GPT-2中，困惑度降低7.5%，参数减少34.8%。

Conclusion: Tversky投影层为深度学习提供了一种新的相似性建模范式，同时增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Work in psychology has highlighted that the geometric model of similarity
standard in deep learning is not psychologically plausible because its metric
properties such as symmetry do not align with human perception. In contrast,
Tversky (1977) proposed an axiomatic theory of similarity based on a
representation of objects as sets of features, and their similarity as a
function of common and distinctive features. However, this model has not been
used in deep learning before, partly due to the challenge of incorporating
discrete set operations. We develop a differentiable parameterization of
Tversky's similarity that is learnable through gradient descent, and derive
neural network building blocks such as the Tversky projection layer, which
unlike the linear projection layer can model non-linear functions such as XOR.
Through experiments with image recognition and language modeling, we show that
the Tversky projection layer is a beneficial replacement for the linear
projection layer, which employs geometric similarity. On the NABirds image
classification task, a frozen ResNet-50 adapted with a Tversky projection layer
achieves a 24.7% relative accuracy improvement over the linear layer adapter
baseline. With Tversky projection layers, GPT-2's perplexity on PTB decreases
by 7.5%, and its parameter count by 34.8%. Finally, we propose a unified
interpretation of both projection layers as computing similarities of input
stimuli to learned prototypes, for which we also propose a novel visualization
technique highlighting the interpretability of Tversky projection layers. Our
work offers a new paradigm for thinking about the similarity model implicit in
deep learning, and designing networks that are interpretable under an
established theory of psychological similarity.

Conclusion: 视觉直觉可作为公平性审计的可扩展代理，为众包偏见检测开辟新途径。

Abstract: Machine learning systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
yet they remain vulnerable to bias systematic disparities that
disproportionately impact specific demographic groups. Traditional bias
detection methods often depend on access to sensitive labels or rely on rigid
fairness metrics, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. This
paper introduces a novel, perception-driven framework for bias detection that
leverages crowdsourced human judgment. Inspired by reCAPTCHA and other
crowd-powered systems, we present a lightweight web platform that displays
stripped-down visualizations of numeric data (for example-salary distributions
across demographic clusters) and collects binary judgments on group similarity.
We explore how users' visual perception-shaped by layout, spacing, and question
phrasing can signal potential disparities. User feedback is aggregated to flag
data segments as biased, which are then validated through statistical tests and
machine learning cross-evaluations. Our findings show that perceptual signals
from non-expert users reliably correlate with known bias cases, suggesting that
visual intuition can serve as a powerful, scalable proxy for fairness auditing.
This approach offers a label-efficient, interpretable alternative to
conventional fairness diagnostics, paving the way toward human-aligned,
crowdsourced bias detection pipelines.

Method: 提出ICL框架，包含测试时人机交互模块（THI）和数据重组增强策略（RDA），利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）优化查询意图。

Result: 在四个TIReID基准测试中表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ICL框架通过交互和数据增强有效提升了TIReID的性能。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in text-to-image person re-identification
(TIReID) facilitated by the breakthrough of cross-modal embedding models,
existing methods often struggle to distinguish challenging candidate images due
to intrinsic limitations, such as network architecture and data quality. To
address these issues, we propose an Interactive Cross-modal Learning framework
(ICL), which leverages human-centered interaction to enhance the
discriminability of text queries through external multimodal knowledge. To
achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play Test-time Humane-centered Interaction
(THI) module, which performs visual question answering focused on human
characteristics, facilitating multi-round interactions with a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) to align query intent with latent target images.
Specifically, THI refines user queries based on the MLLM responses to reduce
the gap to the best-matching images, thereby boosting ranking accuracy.
Additionally, to address the limitation of low-quality training texts, we
introduce a novel Reorganization Data Augmentation (RDA) strategy based on
information enrichment and diversity enhancement to enhance query
discriminability by enriching, decomposing, and reorganizing person
descriptions. Extensive experiments on four TIReID benchmarks, i.e.,
CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES, RSTPReid, and UFine6926, demonstrate that our method
achieves remarkable performance with substantial improvement.

Abstract: Growing concerns over privacy, security, and legal barriers are driving the
rising demand for synthetic data across domains such as healthcare, finance,
and energy. While generative models offer a promising solution to overcome
these barriers, their utility depends on the incorporation of domain-specific
knowledge. We propose to synthesize data using a guided diffusion model that
integrates domain constraints directly into the generative process. We develop
the model in the context of power systems, with potential applicability to
other domains that involve tabular data. Specifically, we synthesize
statistically representative and high-fidelity power flow datasets. To satisfy
domain constraints, e.g., Kirchhoff laws, we introduce a gradient-based
guidance to steer the sampling trajectory in a feasible direction. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: GRePO-LTV框架能够有效提升LTV预测的准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LTV预测提供了一种高效解决方案，解决了数据稀缺和任务依赖性的挑战。

Abstract: The LifeTime Value (LTV) prediction, which endeavors to forecast the
cumulative purchase contribution of a user to a particular item, remains a
vital challenge that advertisers are keen to resolve. A precise LTV prediction
system enhances the alignment of user interests with meticulously designed
advertisements, thereby generating substantial profits for advertisers.
Nonetheless, this issue is complicated by the paucity of data typically
observed in real-world advertising scenarios. The purchase rate among
registered users is often as critically low as 0.1%, resulting in a dataset
where the majority of users make only several purchases. Consequently, there is
insufficient supervisory signal for effectively training the LTV prediction
model. An additional challenge emerges from the interdependencies among tasks
with high correlation. It is a common practice to estimate a user's
contribution to a game over a specified temporal interval. Varying the lengths
of these intervals corresponds to distinct predictive tasks, which are highly
correlated. For instance, predictions over a 7-day period are heavily reliant
on forecasts made over a 3-day period, where exceptional cases can adversely
affect the accuracy of both tasks. In order to comprehensively address the
aforementioned challenges, we introduce an innovative framework denoted as
Graph-Represented Pareto-Optimal LifeTime Value prediction (GRePO-LTV). Graph
representation learning is initially employed to address the issue of data
scarcity. Subsequently, Pareto-Optimization is utilized to manage the
interdependence of prediction tasks.

Conclusion: MoTE框架有效解决了类增量学习中的维度不一致和参数覆盖问题，并通过Adapter-Limited MoTE进一步优化了性能与适配器扩展的平衡。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) requires deep learning models to
continuously acquire new knowledge from streaming data while preserving
previously learned information. Recently, CIL based on pre-trained models
(PTMs) has achieved remarkable success. However, prompt-based approaches suffer
from prompt overwriting, while adapter-based methods face challenges such as
dimensional misalignment between tasks. While the idea of expert fusion in
Mixture of Experts (MoE) can help address dimensional inconsistency, both
expert and routing parameters are prone to being overwritten in dynamic
environments, making MoE challenging to apply directly in CIL. To tackle these
issues, we propose a mixture of task-specific experts (MoTE) framework that
effectively mitigates the miscalibration caused by inconsistent output
dimensions across tasks. Inspired by the weighted feature fusion and sparse
activation mechanisms in MoE, we introduce task-aware expert filtering and
reliable expert joint inference during the inference phase, mimicking the
behavior of routing layers without inducing catastrophic forgetting. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method without requiring an
exemplar set. Furthermore, the number of tasks in MoTE scales linearly with the
number of adapters. Building on this, we further explore the trade-off between
adapter expansion and model performance and propose the Adapter-Limited MoTE.

Result: ADG显著优于现有方法，生成图像在文本对齐、颜色保真度和人类感知偏好上表现更好。

Conclusion: ADG有效解决了CFG的颜色失真问题，同时保持了高质量的文本-图像对齐。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has emerged as a pivotal advancement in
text-to-image latent diffusion models, establishing itself as a cornerstone
technique for achieving high-quality image synthesis. However, under high
guidance weights, where text-image alignment is significantly enhanced, CFG
also leads to pronounced color distortions in the generated images. We identify
that these distortions stem from the amplification of sample norms in the
latent space. We present a theoretical framework that elucidates the mechanisms
of norm amplification and anomalous diffusion phenomena induced by
classifier-free guidance. Leveraging our theoretical insights and the latent
space structure, we propose an Angle Domain Guidance (ADG) algorithm. ADG
constrains magnitude variations while optimizing angular alignment, thereby
mitigating color distortions while preserving the enhanced text-image alignment
achieved at higher guidance weights. Experimental results demonstrate that ADG
significantly outperforms existing methods, generating images that not only
maintain superior text alignment but also exhibit improved color fidelity and
better alignment with human perceptual preferences.

Abstract: Time series analysis is pivotal in domains like financial forecasting and
biomedical monitoring, yet traditional methods are constrained by limited
nonlinear feature representation and long-term dependency capture. The
emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential by
leveraging their cross-modal knowledge integration and inherent attention
mechanisms for time series analysis. However, the development of
general-purpose LLMs for time series from scratch is still hindered by data
diversity, annotation scarcity, and computational requirements. This paper
presents a systematic review of pre-trained LLM-driven time series analysis,
focusing on enabling techniques, potential applications, and open challenges.
First, it establishes an evolutionary roadmap of AI-driven time series
analysis, from the early machine learning era, through the emerging LLM-driven
paradigm, to the development of native temporal foundation models. Second, it
organizes and systematizes the technical landscape of LLM-driven time series
analysis from a workflow perspective, covering LLMs' input, optimization, and
lightweight stages. Finally, it critically examines novel real-world
applications and highlights key open challenges that can guide future research
and innovation. The work not only provides valuable insights into current
advances but also outlines promising directions for future development. It
serves as a foundational reference for both academic and industrial
researchers, paving the way for the development of more efficient,
generalizable, and interpretable systems of LLM-driven time series analysis.

TL;DR: ChemHGNN是一种超图神经网络框架，用于解决化学反应虚拟筛选中的多反应物交互问题，显著优于传统GNN和HGNN。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN难以建模多反应物交互，限制了反应虚拟筛选的效果。

Method: 提出ChemHGNN框架，利用超边建模多反应物关系，引入反应中心感知负采样策略（RCNS）和分层嵌入方法。

Result: 在USPTO数据集上，ChemHGNN显著优于基线模型，尤其在大规模场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: ChemHGNN为反应虚拟筛选提供了更优的解决方案，加速了反应发现过程。

Abstract: Reaction virtual screening and discovery are fundamental challenges in
chemistry and materials science, where traditional graph neural networks (GNNs)
struggle to model multi-reactant interactions. In this work, we propose
ChemHGNN, a hypergraph neural network (HGNN) framework that effectively
captures high-order relationships in reaction networks. Unlike GNNs, which
require constructing complete graphs for multi-reactant reactions, ChemHGNN
naturally models multi-reactant reactions through hyperedges, enabling more
expressive reaction representations. To address key challenges, such as
combinatorial explosion, model collapse, and chemically invalid negative
samples, we introduce a reaction center-aware negative sampling strategy (RCNS)
and a hierarchical embedding approach combining molecule, reaction and
hypergraph level features. Experiments on the USPTO dataset demonstrate that
ChemHGNN significantly outperforms HGNN and GNN baselines, particularly in
large-scale settings, while maintaining interpretability and chemical
plausibility. Our work establishes HGNNs as a superior alternative to GNNs for
reaction virtual screening and discovery, offering a chemically informed
framework for accelerating reaction discovery.

*Baoquan Zhang,Guangning Xu,Michael. K. Ng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GenFT提出了一种新的参数高效微调方法，通过利用预训练权重指导任务特定权重的更新，避免从头训练，提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何利用预训练权重指导任务特定权重的更新，避免低效的从头训练。

Method: GenFT通过行列变换从预训练权重中提取结构化信息，并将任务特定权重分解为层共享和层特定组件。

Result: 在CV和NLP任务中表现优异，优于现有PEFT方法。

Conclusion: GenFT为高效模型适应提供了新视角，简单且有效。

Abstract: Pretrained Foundation Models (PFMs) have transformed numerous applications by
enabling efficient adaptation to customized tasks. Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient alternative to full
fine-tuning, especially leveraging reparameterized weights $\Delta W$ to adapt
models for downstream tasks. However, a critical yet underexplored question
remains: can we utilize well-pretrained weights $W_0$ to guide the update of
task-specific $\Delta W$, avoiding inefficient training it from scratch? To end
this, we propose Generative Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (GenFT), a novel
method that extracts structured, transferable information from $W_0$ for
efficient $\Delta W$ training. To extract row and column structure information,
GenFT applies row and column transformations to distill essential patterns from
$W_0$. A tailored policy further decomposes $\Delta W$ into layer-shared and
layer-specific components, balancing information reuse and individualized
flexibility. GenFT is simple yet effective, achieving superior performance
across CV and NLP tasks. Extensive experiments on VTAB-1K, FGVC, and GLUE
benchmarks demonstrate that GenFT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods,
offering a new perspective for efficient model adaptation.

Conclusion: 本文为零空间视角减轻量化误差的首步探索，希望启发未来更先进的量化方法设计。

Abstract: Existing post-training quantization methods for large language models (LLMs)
offer remarkable success. However, the increasingly marginal performance gains
suggest that existing quantization strategies are insufficient to support the
development of more compressed models. To inspire new directions for future
research, this paper introduces the concept of null space into LLMs
quantization. We argue that the quantization error can be effectively
alleviated by constraining the post-quantization weight perturbation to lie
within the null space of input activations. To prove this idea, we propose a
plug-and-play null space projection module for existing milestone PTQ baselines
named Q2N. Specifically, we first design an efficient and accurate null space
projection approximation method tailored to the characteristics of LLMs.
Subsequently, we theoretically derive a closed-form solution for an equivalent
vector of the obtained projection matrix, which satisfies practical inference
condition while avoiding additional memory overhead. Extensive experiments are
conducted on various state-of-the-art LLMs (LLaMA3, DeepSeek, Qwen3) and
baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of both our Q2N and the perspective
of null space optimization for LLMs quantization. We view this paper the first
step to further alleviate the quantization error based on the insights of null
space, hoping it inspiring future researchers to design more advanced
quantization methods. Codes are available at https://github.com/zjq0455/q2n.

Abstract: Although the power of LLM tool-use agents has ignited a flurry of recent
research in this area, the curation of tool-use training data remains an open
problem$-$especially for online RL training. Existing approaches to synthetic
tool-use data generation tend to be non-interactive, and/or non-compositional.
We introduce RandomWorld, a pipeline for the procedural generation of
interactive tools and compositional tool-use data. We show that models tuned
via SFT and RL on synthetic RandomWorld data improve on a range of tool-use
benchmarks, and set the new SoTA for two metrics on the NESTFUL dataset.
Further experiments show that downstream performance scales with the amount of
RandomWorld-generated training data, opening up the possibility of further
improvement through the use of entirely synthetic data.

Abstract: Confidence estimation is crucial for reflecting the reliability of large

Utilizing data augmentation for confidence estimation is viable, but
discussions focus on specific augmentation techniques, limiting its potential.
We study the impact of different data augmentation methods on confidence
estimation. Our findings indicate that data augmentation strategies can achieve
better performance and mitigate the impact of overconfidence. We investigate
the influential factors related to this and discover that, while preserving
semantic information, greater data diversity enhances the effectiveness of
augmentation. Furthermore, the impact of different augmentation strategies
varies across different range of application. Considering parameter
transferability and usability, the random combination of augmentations is a
promising choice.

TL;DR: 论文提出CMuSeNet，一种基于复数神经网络的宽频段频谱感知方法，显著提升了低信噪比环境下的信号检测性能和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无线电频谱日益拥挤，传统实数神经网络在低信噪比环境下难以捕捉无线信号的相位和幅度特性，限制了频谱利用效率。

Method: CMuSeNet采用复数神经网络（CVNNs）和残差架构，引入复数傅里叶谱焦点损失（CFL）和复数平面交并比（CIoU）相似性度量。

Conclusion: 复数神经网络架构在低信噪比环境下显著提升了频谱感知的性能和效率。

Abstract: The increasing congestion of the radio frequency spectrum presents challenges
for efficient spectrum utilization. Cognitive radio systems enable dynamic
spectrum access with the aid of recent innovations in neural networks. However,
traditional real-valued neural networks (RVNNs) face difficulties in low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, as they were not specifically
developed to capture essential wireless signal properties such as phase and
amplitude. This work presents CMuSeNet, a complex-valued multi-signal
segmentation network for wideband spectrum sensing, to address these
limitations. Extensive hyperparameter analysis shows that a naive conversion of
existing RVNNs into their complex-valued counterparts is ineffective. Built on
complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) with a residual architecture, CMuSeNet
introduces a complexvalued Fourier spectrum focal loss (CFL) and a complex
plane intersection over union (CIoU) similarity metric to enhance training
performance. Extensive evaluations on synthetic, indoor overthe-air, and
real-world datasets show that CMuSeNet achieves an average accuracy of
98.98%-99.90%, improving by up to 9.2 percentage points over its real-valued
counterpart and consistently outperforms state of the art. Strikingly, CMuSeNet
achieves the accuracy level of its RVNN counterpart in just two epochs,
compared to the 27 epochs required for RVNN, while reducing training time by up
to a 92.2% over the state of the art. The results highlight the effectiveness
of complex-valued architectures in improving weak signal detection and training
efficiency for spectrum sensing in challenging low-SNR environments. The
dataset is available at: https://dx.doi.org/10.21227/hcc1-6p22

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了NSW-EPNews基准，结合时间序列模型和大语言模型（LLMs）进行电价预测，发现新闻特征对传统模型效果有限，LLMs虽有提升但存在幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电价预测方法过于依赖数值历史数据，忽略了文本信号。

Method: 使用多模态输入（滞后价格、向量化新闻和天气特征）进行48步预测，并设计模板评估LLMs。

Result: 传统模型从新闻特征中获益有限；LLMs性能略有提升但存在幻觉。

Conclusion: NSW-EPNews为多模态数值推理提供了测试平台，揭示了LLMs在高风险能源预测中的能力差距。

Abstract: Electricity price forecasting is a critical component of modern
energy-management systems, yet existing approaches heavily rely on numerical
histories and ignore contemporaneous textual signals. We introduce NSW-EPNews,
the first benchmark that jointly evaluates time-series models and large
language models (LLMs) on real-world electricity-price prediction. The dataset
includes over 175,000 half-hourly spot prices from New South Wales, Australia
(2015-2024), daily temperature readings, and curated market-news summaries from
WattClarity. We frame the task as 48-step-ahead forecasting, using multimodal
input, including lagged prices, vectorized news and weather features for
classical models, and prompt-engineered structured contexts for LLMs. Our
datasets yields 3.6k multimodal prompt-output pairs for LLM evaluation using
specific templates. Through compresive benchmark design, we identify that for
traditional statistical and machine learning models, the benefits gain is
marginal from news feature. For state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and
Gemini 1.5 Pro, we observe modest performance increase while it also produce
frequent hallucinations such as fabricated and malformed price sequences.
NSW-EPNews provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating grounded numerical
reasoning in multimodal settings, and highlights a critical gap between current
LLM capabilities and the demands of high-stakes energy forecasting.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning
capabilities, yet their direct application to NP-hard combinatorial problems
(CPs) remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the
reasoning abilities of LLMs on a variety of NP-hard combinatorial optimization
tasks and introduce ACCORD: Autoregressive Constraint-satisfying generation for
COmbinatorial optimization with Routing and Dynamic attention. ACCORD features
a novel dataset representation and model architecture that leverage the
autoregressive nature of LLMs to dynamically enforce feasibility constraints,
coupled with attention-based routing to activate problem-specific LoRA modules.
We also present the ACCORD-90k supervised dataset, covering six NP-hard
combinatorial problems: TSP, VRP, Knapsack, FlowShop, JSSP, and BinPacking.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ACCORD model, built on an
8B-parameter Llama backbone, consistently outperforms standard prompting and
input-output methods, even when compared to much larger LLMs, such as gpt-4.
Ablation studies further show that our output structure enhances solution
feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale,
end-to-end framework for exploring the applications of LLMs to a broad spectrum
of combinatorial optimization problems. The codes are publicly available at

Abstract: User Behavior Sequence (UBS) modeling is crucial in industrial applications.
As data scale and task diversity grow, UBS pretraining methods have become
increasingly pivotal. State-of-the-art UBS pretraining methods rely on
predicting behavior distributions. The key step in these methods is
constructing a selected behavior vocabulary. However, this manual step is
labor-intensive and prone to bias. The limitation of vocabulary capacity also
directly affects models' generalization ability. In this paper, we introduce
Bootstrapping Your Behavior (\model{}), a novel UBS pretraining strategy that
predicts an automatically constructed supervision embedding summarizing all
behaviors' information within a future time window, eliminating the manual
behavior vocabulary selection. In implementation, we incorporate a
student-teacher encoder scheme to construct the pretraining supervision
effectively. Experiments on two real-world industrial datasets and eight
downstream tasks demonstrate that \model{} achieves an average improvement of
3.9\% in AUC and 98.9\% in training throughput. Notably, the model exhibits
meaningful attention patterns and cluster representations during pretraining
without any label supervision. In our online deployment over two months, the
pretrained model improves the KS by about 2.7\% and 7.1\% over the baseline
model for two financial overdue risk prediction tasks in the Alipay mobile
application, which reduces bad debt risk by millions of dollars for Ant group.

Abstract: The dynamic nature of Internet of Things (IoT) environments challenges the
long-term effectiveness of Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) compositions.
The uncertainty and variability of IoT environments lead to fluctuations in
data distribution, e.g., concept drift and data heterogeneity, and evolving
system requirements, e.g., scalability demands and resource limitations. This
paper proposes an adaptive MLaaS composition framework to ensure a seamless,
efficient, and scalable MLaaS composition. The framework integrates a service
assessment model to identify underperforming MLaaS services and a candidate
selection model to filter optimal replacements. An adaptive composition
mechanism is developed that incrementally updates MLaaS compositions using a
contextual multi-armed bandit optimization strategy. By continuously adapting
to evolving IoT constraints, the approach maintains Quality of Service (QoS)
while reducing the computational cost associated with recomposition from
scratch. Experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the
efficiency of our proposed approach.

Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to
revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with
tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made,
successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample
data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures).
Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale
structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to
construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this
challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from
hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution
is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of
local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations,
and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a
large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct
PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a
structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and
scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot
solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D
experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly
available to the community.

Abstract: Inverse problems are central to a wide range of fields, including healthcare,
climate science, and agriculture. They involve the estimation of inputs,
typically via iterative optimization, to some known forward model so that it
produces a desired outcome. Despite considerable development in the
explainability and interpretability of forward models, the iterative
optimization of inverse problems remains largely cryptic to domain experts. We
propose a methodology to produce explanations, from traces produced by an
optimizer, that are interpretable by humans at the abstraction of the domain.
The central idea in our approach is to instrument a differentiable simulator so
that it emits natural language events during its forward and backward passes.
In a post-process, we use a Language Model to create an explanation from the
list of events. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with an
illustrative optimization problem and an example involving the training of a
neural network.

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to operation research and
theoretical computer science, present significant computational challenges due
to their NP-hard nature. While large language models (LLMs) have emerged as
promising tools for CO--either by directly generating solutions or synthesizing
solver-specific codes--existing approaches often neglect critical structural
priors inherent to CO problems, leading to suboptimality and iterative
inefficiency. Inspired by human experts' success in leveraging CO structures
for algorithm design, we propose STRCMP, a novel structure-aware LLM-based
algorithm discovery framework that systematically integrates structure priors
to enhance solution quality and solving efficiency. Our framework combines a
graph neural network (GNN) for extracting structural embeddings from CO
instances with an LLM conditioned on these embeddings to identify
high-performing algorithms in the form of solver-specific codes. This composite
architecture ensures syntactic correctness, preserves problem topology, and
aligns with natural language objectives, while an evolutionary refinement
process iteratively optimizes generated algorithm. Extensive evaluations across
Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Boolean Satisfiability problems, using
nine benchmark datasets, demonstrate that our proposed STRCMP outperforms five
strong neural and LLM-based methods by a large margin, in terms of both
solution optimality and computational efficiency. The code and learned model
will be publicly available upon the acceptance of the paper.

Method: 提出ADAMIX框架，通过数学推导量化误差，将最优混合精度位分配问题转化为0/1整数线性规划问题。

Result: 在AIME2024和GQA任务中，ADAMIX分别以22.3%和6.1%的优势超越最佳基线Delta-CoMe。

Conclusion: ADAMIX通过自适应混合精度策略，显著提升了delta压缩的性能和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance on various
knowledge-intensive and complex reasoning tasks in different domains. In
certain scenarios like multi-tenant serving, a large number of LLMs finetuned
from the same base model are deployed to meet complex requirements for users.
Recent works explore delta-compression approaches to quantize and compress the
delta parameters between the customized LLM and the corresponding base model.
However, existing works either exhibit unsatisfactory performance at high
compression ratios or depend on empirical bit allocation schemes. In this work,
we propose ADAMIX, an effective adaptive mixed-precision delta-compression
framework. We provide a mathematical derivation of quantization error to
motivate our mixed-precision compression strategy and formulate the optimal
mixed-precision bit allocation scheme as the solution to a 0/1 integer linear
programming problem. Our derived bit allocation strategy minimizes the
quantization error while adhering to a predefined compression ratio
requirement. Experimental results on various models and benchmarks demonstrate
that our approach surpasses the best baseline by a considerable margin. On
tasks like AIME2024 and GQA, where the norm of $\Delta \mathbf{W}$ is large and
the base model lacks sufficient ability, ADAMIX outperforms the best baseline
Delta-CoMe by 22.3% and 6.1% with 7B models, respectively.

This simplification could make LLMs' responses biased to mostly preferred
features, and would be exacerbated during the iterations of online preference
learning steps. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework
coined PFP (Preference Feature Preservation). The key idea of PFP is
maintaining the distribution of human preference features and utilizing such
rich signals throughout the online preference learning process. Specifically,
PFP first extract preference features from offline pairwise human preference
data and trains a feature classifier. Then, using trained classifier and the
distribution preserving optimization, PFP maps appropriate preference features
for a new input instruction during online learning. Lastly, PFP trains LLM
using the existing preference learning method, by incorporating the preference
feature into system prompts and enabling LLM to explicitly handle various human
preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that PFP successfully mitigates the
bias in preference features during online learning, and hence achieves superior
performance compared to previous preference learning methods on standard
benchmarks to evaluate LLM alignment.

TL;DR: SectorE是一种基于极坐标的新型知识图谱嵌入模型，通过环形扇区建模关系和点嵌入实体，有效捕捉语义层次结构，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有区域嵌入模型通常忽略实体的语义层次结构，导致知识图谱补全任务效果受限。

Method: 提出SectorE模型，将关系建模为环形扇区（极坐标中的模和相位），实体嵌入为扇区内的点，以编码层次结构。

Conclusion: SectorE通过极坐标建模关系和实体，显著提升了知识图谱补全任务的性能，尤其在捕捉语义层次结构方面表现突出。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs), structured as multi-relational data of entities and
relations, are vital for tasks like data analysis and recommendation systems.
Knowledge graph completion (KGC), or link prediction, addresses incompleteness
of KGs by inferring missing triples (h, r, t). It is vital for downstream
applications. Region-based embedding models usually embed entities as points
and relations as geometric regions to accomplish the task. Despite progress,
these models often overlook semantic hierarchies inherent in entities. To solve
this problem, we propose SectorE, a novel embedding model in polar coordinates.
Relations are modeled as annular sectors, combining modulus and phase to
capture inference patterns and relation attributes. Entities are embedded as
points within these sectors, intuitively encoding hierarchical structure.
Evaluated on FB15k-237, WN18RR, and YAGO3-10, SectorE achieves competitive
performance against various kinds of models, demonstrating strengths in
semantic modeling capability.

Abstract: Structure determination workloads in neutron diffractometry are
computationally expensive and routinely require several hours to many days to
determine the structure of a material from its neutron diffraction patterns.
The potential for machine learning models trained on simulated neutron
scattering patterns to significantly speed up these tasks have been reported
recently. However, the amount of simulated data needed to train these models
grows exponentially with the number of structural parameters to be predicted
and poses a significant computational challenge. To overcome this challenge, we
introduce a novel batch-mode active learning (AL) policy that uses uncertainty
sampling to simulate training data drawn from a probability distribution that
prefers labelled examples about which the model is least certain. We confirm
its efficacy in training the same models with about 75% less training data
while improving the accuracy. We then discuss the design of an efficient
stream-based training workflow that uses this AL policy and present a
performance study on two heterogeneous platforms to demonstrate that, compared
with a conventional training workflow, the streaming workflow delivers about
20% shorter training time without any loss of accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列数据在不同粒度上表现出状态，现有方法无法统一处理多粒度且难以适应动态环境中的新模式。

Method: 提出PromptTSS框架，利用提示机制结合标签和边界信息，统一捕捉粗粒度和细粒度模式，并动态适应新模式。

Result: 实验显示PromptTSS在多粒度分割中精度提升24.49%，单粒度分割提升17.88%，迁移学习性能提升高达599.24%。

Conclusion: PromptTSS有效解决了多粒度状态分割和动态适应性问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multivariate time series data, collected across various fields such as
manufacturing and wearable technology, exhibit states at multiple levels of
granularity, from coarse-grained system behaviors to fine-grained, detailed
events. Effectively segmenting and integrating states across these different
granularities is crucial for tasks like predictive maintenance and performance
optimization. However, existing time series segmentation methods face two key
challenges: (1) the inability to handle multiple levels of granularity within a
unified model, and (2) limited adaptability to new, evolving patterns in
dynamic environments. To address these challenges, we propose PromptTSS, a
novel framework for time series segmentation with multi-granularity states.
PromptTSS uses a unified model with a prompting mechanism that leverages label
and boundary information to guide segmentation, capturing both coarse- and
fine-grained patterns while adapting dynamically to unseen patterns.
Experiments show PromptTSS improves accuracy by 24.49% in multi-granularity
segmentation, 17.88% in single-granularity segmentation, and up to 599.24% in
transfer learning, demonstrating its adaptability to hierarchical states and
evolving time series dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究关注数据-策略覆盖以缓解分布偏移，但忽视了覆盖不足的安全风险，且单步分析不符合离线RL的多步决策特性。

Method: 引入序列级可集中系数量化覆盖，提出CSDPC毒化攻击，通过识别并毒化稀有决策模式降低覆盖。

Result: 实验表明，仅毒化1%的数据集即可使智能体性能下降90%。

Conclusion: 研究为离线RL的安全分析和防护提供了新视角。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) heavily relies on the coverage of
pre-collected data over the target policy's distribution. Existing studies aim
to improve data-policy coverage to mitigate distributional shifts, but overlook
security risks from insufficient coverage, and the single-step analysis is not
consistent with the multi-step decision-making nature of offline RL. To address
this, we introduce the sequence-level concentrability coefficient to quantify
coverage, and reveal its exponential amplification on the upper bound of
estimation errors through theoretical analysis. Building on this, we propose
the Collapsing Sequence-Level Data-Policy Coverage (CSDPC) poisoning attack.
Considering the continuous nature of offline RL data, we convert state-action
pairs into decision units, and extract representative decision patterns that
capture multi-step behavior. We identify rare patterns likely to cause
insufficient coverage, and poison them to reduce coverage and exacerbate
distributional shifts. Experiments show that poisoning just 1% of the dataset
can degrade agent performance by 90%. This finding provides new perspectives
for analyzing and safeguarding the security of offline RL.

Abstract: Oil and gas reserves are vital resources for the global economy, serving as
key components in transportation, energy production, and industrial processes.
However, oil and gas extraction and production operations may encounter several
challenges, such as pipeline and production line blockages, caused by factors
including sediment accumulation, wax deposition, mineral scaling, and
corrosion. This study addresses these challenges by employing supervised
machine learning techniques, specifically decision trees, the k-Nearest
Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm (k-NN), and the Naive Bayes classifier method, to
detect and mitigate flow assurance challenges, ensuring efficient fluid
transport. The primary focus is on preventing gas hydrate formation in oil
production systems. To achieve this, data preprocessing and cleaning were
conducted to ensure the quality and consistency of the dataset, which was
sourced from Petrobras publicly available 3W project repository on GitHub. The
scikit-learn Python library, a widely recognized open-source tool for
supervised machine learning techniques, was utilized for classification tasks
due to its robustness and versatility. The results demonstrate that the
proposed methodology effectively classifies hydrate formation under operational
conditions, with the decision tree algorithm exhibiting the highest predictive
accuracy (99.99 percent). Consequently, this approach provides a reliable
solution for optimizing production efficiency.

Result: 提出了一个简单有效的方法来平衡多种公平性概念。

Conclusion: 该框架为动态决策系统中的长期公平性研究提供了新视角，并提出了实用的平衡方法。

Abstract: Fairness-aware learning studies the development of algorithms that avoid
discriminatory decision outcomes despite biased training data. While most
studies have concentrated on immediate bias in static contexts, this paper
highlights the importance of investigating long-term fairness in dynamic
decision-making systems while simultaneously considering instantaneous fairness
requirements. In the context of reinforcement learning, we propose a general
framework where long-term fairness is measured by the difference in the average
expected qualification gain that individuals from different groups could
obtain.Then, through a causal lens, we decompose this metric into three
components that represent the direct impact, the delayed impact, as well as the
spurious effect the policy has on the qualification gain. We analyze the
intrinsic connection between these components and an emerging fairness notion
called benefit fairness that aims to control the equity of outcomes in
decision-making. Finally, we develop a simple yet effective approach for
balancing various fairness notions.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在F1分数上提升了1-15%，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MOODS框架和ε/δ指标有效解决了类别不平衡问题，提升了分类多样性。

Abstract: Two-class classification problems are often characterized by an imbalance
between the number of majority and minority datapoints resulting in poor
classification of the minority class in particular. Traditional approaches,
such as reweighting the loss function or na\"ive resampling, risk overfitting
and subsequently fail to improve classification because they do not consider
the diversity between majority and minority datasets. Such consideration is
infeasible because there is no metric that can measure the impact of imbalance
on the model. To obviate these challenges, we make two key contributions.
First, we introduce MOODS~(Multi-Objective Optimization for Data Sampling), a
novel multi-objective bilevel optimization framework that guides both synthetic
oversampling and majority undersampling. Second, we introduce a validation
metric -- `$\epsilon/ \delta$ non-overlapping diversification metric' -- that
quantifies the goodness of a sampling method towards model performance. With
this metric we experimentally demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
improvement in diversity driving a $1-15 \%$ increase in $F1$ scores.

Conclusion: ASNO为科学机器学习提供了一种可解释且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: In scientific machine learning (SciML), a key challenge is learning unknown,
evolving physical processes and making predictions across spatio-temporal
scales. For example, in real-world manufacturing problems like additive
manufacturing, users adjust known machine settings while unknown environmental
parameters simultaneously fluctuate. To make reliable predictions, it is
desired for a model to not only capture long-range spatio-temporal interactions
from data but also adapt to new and unknown environments; traditional machine
learning models excel at the first task but often lack physical
interpretability and struggle to generalize under varying environmental
conditions. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Attention-based
Spatio-Temporal Neural Operator (ASNO), a novel architecture that combines
separable attention mechanisms for spatial and temporal interactions and adapts
to unseen physical parameters. Inspired by the backward differentiation formula
(BDF), ASNO learns a transformer for temporal prediction and extrapolation and
an attention-based neural operator for handling varying external loads,
enhancing interpretability by isolating historical state contributions and
external forces, enabling the discovery of underlying physical laws and
generalizability to unseen physical environments. Empirical results on SciML
benchmarks demonstrate that ASNO outperforms over existing models, establishing
its potential for engineering applications, physics discovery, and
interpretable machine learning.

Abstract: We study the sample complexity of stochastic convex optimization when problem
parameters, e.g., the distance to optimality, are unknown. We pursue two
strategies. First, we develop a reliable model selection method that avoids
overfitting the validation set. This method allows us to generically tune the
learning rate of stochastic optimization methods to match the optimal
known-parameter sample complexity up to $\log\log$ factors. Second, we develop
a regularization-based method that is specialized to the case that only the
distance to optimality is unknown. This method provides perfect adaptability to
unknown distance to optimality, demonstrating a separation between the sample
and computational complexity of parameter-free stochastic convex optimization.
Combining these two methods allows us to simultaneously adapt to multiple
problem structures.
  Experiments performing few-shot learning on CIFAR-10 by fine-tuning CLIP
models and prompt engineering Gemini to count shapes indicate that our reliable
model selection method can help mitigate overfitting to small validation sets.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了不同架构和数据模态下的组鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Evidential Alignment为虚假相关性提供了一种可扩展且理论支持的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often learn and rely on spurious correlations, i.e.,
superficial associations between non-causal features and the targets. For
instance, an image classifier may identify camels based on the desert
backgrounds. While it can yield high overall accuracy during training, it
degrades generalization on more diverse scenarios where such correlations do
not hold. This problem poses significant challenges for out-of-distribution
robustness and trustworthiness. Existing methods typically mitigate this issue
by using external group annotations or auxiliary deterministic models to learn
unbiased representations. However, such information is costly to obtain, and
deterministic models may fail to capture the full spectrum of biases learned by
the models. To address these limitations, we propose Evidential Alignment, a
novel framework that leverages uncertainty quantification to understand the
behavior of the biased models without requiring group annotations. By
quantifying the evidence of model prediction with second-order risk
minimization and calibrating the biased models with the proposed evidential
calibration technique, Evidential Alignment identifies and suppresses spurious
correlations while preserving core features. We theoretically justify the
effectiveness of our method as capable of learning the patterns of biased
models and debiasing the model without requiring any spurious correlation
annotations. Empirical results demonstrate that our method significantly
improves group robustness across diverse architectures and data modalities,
providing a scalable and principled solution to spurious correlations.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods have shown remarkable empirical success,
yet their theoretical generalization properties remain only partially
understood. In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient
flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel
methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a
data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels
such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both
data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative
generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the
training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final
generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine
stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher
complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for
overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of
neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world
datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization
gap.

Result: 实验表明，EDN的两种变体对GNN和噪声鲁棒算法的性能影响更大，验证了其重要性。

Conclusion: 在评估图数据的噪声鲁棒算法时，应考虑EDN模型以提高可靠性。

Abstract: An important structural feature of a graph is its set of edges, as it
captures the relationships among the nodes (the graph's topology). Existing
node label noise models like Symmetric Label Noise (SLN) and Class Conditional
Noise (CCN) disregard this important node relationship in graph data; and the
Edge-Dependent Noise (EDN) model addresses this limitation. EDN posits that in
real-world scenarios, label noise may be influenced by the connections between
nodes. We explore three variants of EDN. A crucial notion that relates nodes
and edges in a graph is the degree of a node; we show that in all three
variants, the probability of a node's label corruption is dependent on its
degree. Additionally, we compare the dependence of these probabilities on node
degree across different variants. We performed experiments on popular graph
datasets using 5 different GNN architectures and 8 noise robust algorithms for
graph data. The results demonstrate that 2 variants of EDN lead to greater
performance degradation in both Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and existing
noise-robust algorithms, as compared to traditional node label noise models. We
statistically verify this by posing a suitable hypothesis-testing problem. This
emphasizes the importance of incorporating EDN when evaluating noise robust
algorithms for graphs, to enhance the reliability of graph-based learning in
noisy environments.

Result: 随机性在精确分数下可作为误差校正机制，降低KL散度；在近似分数下则存在误差校正与放大的权衡。

Conclusion: 随机性的效果取决于分数误差的结构，需根据具体场景选择参数。

Abstract: Sampling in score-based diffusion models can be performed by solving either a
probability flow ODE or a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE)
parameterized by an arbitrary stochasticity parameter. In this work, we study
the effect of stochasticity on the generation process through bounds on the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and complement the analysis with numerical and
analytical examples. Our results apply to general forward SDEs with additive
noise and Lipschitz-continuous score functions, and quantify how errors from
the prior distribution and score approximation propagate under different
choices of the stochasticity parameter. The theoretical bounds are derived
using log-Sobolev inequalities for the marginals of the forward process, which
enable a more effective control of the KL divergence decay along sampling. For
exact score functions, we find that stochasticity acts as an error-correcting
mechanism, decreasing KL divergence along the sampling trajectory. For an
approximate score function, there is a trade-off between error correction and
score error amplification, so that stochasticity can either improve or worsen
the performance, depending on the structure of the score error. Numerical
experiments on simple datasets and a fully analytical example are included to
illustrate and enlighten the theoretical results.

Abstract: This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the
Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to
enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on
unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure
the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate
prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a
feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of
spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based
regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly
encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting
localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for
surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric
circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark.
Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance
while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature.
Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask
overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for
interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.

TL;DR: PEFT（如LoRA）在高效微调预训练大模型时，可能因依赖虚假标记（SSTI）导致模型行为被操控。研究发现，仅需少量标记即可控制模型决策，且LoRA秩与虚假标记依赖相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索PEFT在高效微调中可能引发的灾难性失败，尤其是虚假标记对模型行为的操控。

Method: 通过Seamless Spurious Token Injection（SSTI）在多个模型和数据集上测试，分析虚假标记对决策的影响。

Result: 发现仅需一个虚假标记即可操控模型决策；LoRA秩与虚假标记依赖成正比；高秩LoRA在强SSTI下更鲁棒。

Conclusion: PEFT可能因虚假标记引发安全隐患，需在设计时考虑鲁棒性，高秩LoRA在特定情况下更优。

Abstract: Parameter Efficient FineTuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA),
aligns pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to particular downstream tasks
in a resource-efficient manner. Because efficiency has been the main metric of
progress, very little attention has been put in understanding possible
catastrophic failures. We uncover one such failure: PEFT encourages a model to
search for shortcut solutions to solve its fine-tuning tasks. When very small
amount of tokens, e.g., one token per prompt, are correlated with downstream
task classes, PEFT makes any pretrained model rely predominantly on that token
for decision making. While such spurious tokens may emerge accidentally from
incorrect data cleaning, it also opens opportunities for malevolent parties to
control a model's behavior from Seamless Spurious Token Injection (SSTI). In
SSTI, a small amount of tokens correlated with downstream classes are injected
by the dataset creators. At test time, the finetuned LLM's behavior can be
controlled solely by injecting those few tokens. We apply SSTI across models
from three families (Snowflake Arctic, Apple OpenELM, and Meta LLaMA-3) and
four diverse datasets (IMDB, Financial Classification, CommonSense QA, and Bias
in Bios). Our findings reveal three astonishing behaviors. First, as few as a
single token of SSTI is sufficient to steer a model's decision making. Second,
for light SSTI, the reliance on spurious tokens is proportional to the LoRA
rank. Lastly, with aggressive SSTI, larger LoRA rank values become preferable
to small rank values as it makes the model attend to non-spurious tokens, hence
improving robustness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的联邦学习威胁模型——恶意好奇客户端，通过操纵梯度以推断其他客户端的私有数据，揭示了现有防御措施的盲点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习协议存在隐私泄露风险，尤其是服务器通过梯度合成客户端训练数据。本文旨在探索客户端如何利用类似手段攻击其他客户端。

Method: 提出恶意好奇客户端威胁模型，结合梯度反演和恶意更新策略开发重建算法，理论分析和实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，现有服务器端和客户端防御措施可能无法抵御该攻击，甚至可能加剧数据泄露，重建图像质量提升10-15%。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了联邦学习中新的隐私威胁，呼吁重新审视现有防御机制的设计。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized machine learning without
sharing raw data, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively learn a global
model. However, studies reveal that privacy leakage is possible under commonly
adopted FL protocols. In particular, a server with access to client gradients
can synthesize data resembling the clients' training data. In this paper, we
introduce a novel threat model in FL, named the maliciously curious client,
where a client manipulates its own gradients with the goal of inferring private
data from peers. This attacker uniquely exploits the strength of a Byzantine
adversary, traditionally aimed at undermining model robustness, and repurposes
it to facilitate data reconstruction attack. We begin by formally defining this
novel client-side threat model and providing a theoretical analysis that
demonstrates its ability to achieve significant reconstruction success during
FL training. To demonstrate its practical impact, we further develop a
reconstruction algorithm that combines gradient inversion with malicious update
strategies. Our analysis and experimental results reveal a critical blind spot
in FL defenses: both server-side robust aggregation and client-side privacy
mechanisms may fail against our proposed attack. Surprisingly, standard server-
and client-side defenses designed to enhance robustness or privacy may
unintentionally amplify data leakage. Compared to the baseline approach, a
mistakenly used defense may instead improve the reconstructed image quality by
10-15%.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了RAG系统投毒攻击直接放大模型输出偏见，强调了关注RAG系统公平性的重要性。

Abstract: In Large Language Models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can
significantly enhance the performance of large language models by integrating
external knowledge. However, RAG also introduces new security risks. Existing
research focuses mainly on how poisoning attacks in RAG systems affect model
output quality, overlooking their potential to amplify model biases. For
example, when querying about domestic violence victims, a compromised RAG
system might preferentially retrieve documents depicting women as victims,
causing the model to generate outputs that perpetuate gender stereotypes even
when the original query is gender neutral. To show the impact of the bias, this
paper proposes a Bias Retrieval and Reward Attack (BRRA) framework, which
systematically investigates attack pathways that amplify language model biases
through a RAG system manipulation. We design an adversarial document generation
method based on multi-objective reward functions, employ subspace projection
techniques to manipulate retrieval results, and construct a cyclic feedback
mechanism for continuous bias amplification. Experiments on multiple mainstream
large language models demonstrate that BRRA attacks can significantly enhance
model biases in dimensions. In addition, we explore a dual stage defense
mechanism to effectively mitigate the impacts of the attack. This study reveals
that poisoning attacks in RAG systems directly amplify model output biases and
clarifies the relationship between RAG system security and model fairness. This
novel potential attack indicates that we need to keep an eye on the fairness
issues of the RAG system.

Abstract: Designing protein-binding proteins with high affinity is critical in
biomedical research and biotechnology. Despite recent advancements targeting
specific proteins, the ability to create high-affinity binders for arbitrary
protein targets on demand, without extensive rounds of wet-lab testing, remains
a significant challenge. Here, we introduce PPDiff, a diffusion model to
jointly design the sequence and structure of binders for arbitrary protein
targets in a non-autoregressive manner. PPDiffbuilds upon our developed
Sequence Structure Interleaving Network with Causal attention layers (SSINC),
which integrates interleaved self-attention layers to capture global amino acid
correlations, k-nearest neighbor (kNN) equivariant graph layers to model local
interactions in three-dimensional (3D) space, and causal attention layers to
simplify the intricate interdependencies within the protein sequence. To assess
PPDiff, we curate PPBench, a general protein-protein complex dataset comprising
706,360 complexes from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). The model is pretrained on
PPBenchand finetuned on two real-world applications: target-protein mini-binder
complex design and antigen-antibody complex design. PPDiffconsistently
surpasses baseline methods, achieving success rates of 50.00%, 23.16%, and
16.89% for the pretraining task and the two downstream applications,

Conclusion: TruncQuant为深度神经网络在边缘设备上的高效部署提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on edge devices is a challenging task
due to the increasing complexity of state-of-the-art models, requiring efforts
to reduce model size and inference latency. Recent studies explore models
operating at diverse quantization settings to find the optimal point that
balances computational efficiency and accuracy. Truncation, an effective
approach for achieving lower bit precision mapping, enables a single model to
adapt to various hardware platforms with little to no cost. However,
formulating a training scheme for deep neural networks to withstand the
associated errors introduced by truncation remains a challenge, as the current
quantization-aware training schemes are not designed for the truncation
process. We propose TruncQuant, a novel truncation-ready training scheme
allowing flexible bit precision through bit-shifting in runtime. We achieve
this by aligning TruncQuant with the output of the truncation process,
demonstrating strong robustness across bit-width settings, and offering an
easily implementable training scheme within existing quantization-aware
frameworks. Our code is released at https://github.com/a2jinhee/TruncQuant.

Motivation: 无结构稀疏在现代硬件上难以实现实际加速，因此需要一种硬件友好的结构化稀疏训练方法。

Method: DynaDiag强制对角线稀疏模式，并在训练中保持稀疏计算，同时利用自定义CUDA内核加速计算。

Result: 在多种神经网络架构上，DynaDiag保持与无结构稀疏相当的准确性，并在GPU上实现最高3.13倍的推理加速和1.59倍的训练加速。

Conclusion: DynaDiag是一种高效且硬件友好的结构化稀疏训练方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) have pushed the frontier of
sparse neural network training in structured and unstructured contexts,
matching dense-model performance while drastically reducing parameter counts to
facilitate model scaling. However, unstructured sparsity often fails to
translate into practical speedups on modern hardware. To address this
shortcoming, we propose DynaDiag, a novel structured sparse-to-sparse DST
method that performs at par with unstructured sparsity. DynaDiag enforces a
diagonal sparsity pattern throughout training and preserves sparse computation
in forward and backward passes. We further leverage the diagonal structure to
accelerate computation via a custom CUDA kernel, rendering the method
hardware-friendly. Empirical evaluations on diverse neural architectures
demonstrate that our method maintains accuracy on par with unstructured
counterparts while benefiting from tangible computational gains. Notably, with
90% sparse linear layers in ViTs, we observe up to a 3.13x speedup in online
inference without sacrificing model performance and a 1.59x speedup in training
on a GPU compared to equivalent unstructured layers. Our source code is

Motivation: 多模态学习中，动态融合策略（如注意力机制）常因模型偏好某一模态而失效，导致动态适应性下降。

Method: 提出RollingQ方法，通过旋转查询平衡注意力分配，打破自强化循环并缩小模态间的键分布差距。

Result: 实验验证RollingQ能有效恢复多模态Transformer的动态适应性，提升性能。

Conclusion: RollingQ方法简单有效，为多模态Transformer的动态适应性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal learning faces challenges in effectively fusing information from
diverse modalities, especially when modality quality varies across samples.
Dynamic fusion strategies, such as attention mechanism in Transformers, aim to
address such challenge by adaptively emphasizing modalities based on the
characteristics of input data. However, through amounts of carefully designed
experiments, we surprisingly observed that the dynamic adaptability of
widely-used self-attention models diminishes. Model tends to prefer one
modality regardless of data characteristics. This bias triggers a
self-reinforcing cycle that progressively overemphasizes the favored modality,
widening the distribution gap in attention keys across modalities and
deactivating attention mechanism's dynamic properties. To revive adaptability,
we propose a simple yet effective method Rolling Query (RollingQ), which
balances attention allocation by rotating the query to break the
self-reinforcing cycle and mitigate the key distribution gap. Extensive
experiments on various multimodal scenarios validate the effectiveness of
RollingQ and the restoration of cooperation dynamics is pivotal for enhancing
the broader capabilities of widely deployed multimodal Transformers. The source
code is available at https://github.com/GeWu-Lab/RollingQ_ICML2025.

Result: 在三个数学推理基准测试中，显著减少数据需求（如GSM8K上减少1000数据点），性能优于或接近全数据训练。

Conclusion: LearnAlign为数据高效的RL后训练提供了新思路，并为未来推理数据优化研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a key technique for enhancing LLMs'
reasoning abilities, yet its data inefficiency remains a major bottleneck. To
address this critical yet challenging issue, we present a novel
gradient-alignment-based method, named LearnAlign, which intelligently selects
the learnable and representative training reasoning data for RL post-training.
To overcome the well-known issue of response-length bias in gradient norms, we
introduce the data learnability based on the success rate, which can indicate
the learning potential of each data point. Experiments across three
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly
reduces training data requirements while achieving minor performance
degradation or even improving performance compared to full-data training. For
example, it reduces data requirements by up to 1,000 data points with better
performance (77.53%) than that on the full dataset on GSM8K benchmark (77.04%).
Furthermore, we show its effectiveness in the staged RL setting. This work
provides valuable insights into data-efficient RL post-training and establishes
a foundation for future research in optimizing reasoning data selection.To
facilitate future work, we will release code.

Abstract: Diabetes has emerged as a significant global health issue, especially with

Abstract: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is traditionally assessed using subjective
grading systems, which introduces variability in diagnosis. This study
investigates the use of machine learning to improve diagnostic consistency by
analyzing voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) images. A total of 113 VCUG images
were reviewed, with expert grading of VUR severity. Nine image-based features
were selected to train six predictive models: Logistic Regression, Decision
Tree, Gradient Boosting, Neural Network, and Stochastic Gradient Descent. The
models were evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Analysis identified
deformation patterns in the renal calyces as key indicators of high-grade VUR.
All models achieved accurate classifications with no false positives or
negatives. High sensitivity to subtle image patterns characteristic of
different VUR grades was confirmed by substantial Area Under the Curve (AUC)
values. The results suggest that machine learning can offer an objective and
standardized alternative to current subjective VUR assessments. These findings
highlight renal calyceal deformation as a strong predictor of severe cases.
Future research should aim to expand the dataset, refine imaging features, and
improve model generalizability for broader clinical use.

Abstract: In recent years, deep discrete representation learning (DRL) has achieved
significant success across various domains. Most DRL frameworks (e.g., the
widely used VQ-VAE and its variants) have primarily focused on generative
settings, where the quality of a representation is implicitly gauged by the
fidelity of its generation. In fact, the goodness of a discrete representation
remain ambiguously defined across the literature. In this work, we adopt a
practical approach that examines DRL from a task-driven perspective. We propose
a unified framework that explores the usefulness of discrete features in
relation to downstream tasks, with generation naturally viewed as one possible
application. In this context, the properties of discrete representations as
well as the way they benefit certain tasks are also relatively understudied. We
therefore provide an additional theoretical analysis of the trade-off between
representational capacity and sample complexity, shedding light on how discrete
representation utilization impacts task performance. Finally, we demonstrate
the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across diverse applications.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled unprecedented
capabilities for time-series reasoning in diverse real-world applications,
including medical, financial, and spatio-temporal domains. However, existing
approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as
forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred
to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This
position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series
reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic
primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This
realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning
approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by
systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task
engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective
Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by
prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain,
characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series
reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient
reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented
method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm.
Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms
and outline promising research directions.

Result: 证明了蒸馏权重的偏差与提示和目标分布之间的最大均值差异（MMD）呈线性增长。

Conclusion: 该理论框架为未来的提示工程和自动演示选择提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) allows large language models (LLMs) to solve novel
tasks without weight updates. Despite its empirical success, the mechanism
behind ICL remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to interpret,
improve, and reliably apply it. In this paper, we propose a new theoretical
perspective that interprets ICL as an implicit form of knowledge distillation
(KD), where prompt demonstrations guide the model to form a task-specific
reference model during inference. Under this view, we derive a Rademacher
complexity-based generalization bound and prove that the bias of the distilled
weights grows linearly with the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between the
prompt and target distributions. This theoretical framework explains several
empirical phenomena and unifies prior gradient-based and distributional
analyses. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to formalize
inference-time attention as a distillation process, which provides theoretical
insights for future prompt engineering and automated demonstration selection.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上优于现有方法，展示了跨领域预测潜力。

Conclusion: Delayformer是一种高效且广泛适用的时间序列预测基础模型。

Abstract: Predicting time-series is of great importance in various scientific and
engineering fields. However, in the context of limited and noisy data,
accurately predicting dynamics of all variables in a high-dimensional system is
a challenging task due to their nonlinearity and also complex interactions.
Current methods including deep learning approaches often perform poorly for
real-world systems under such circumstances. This study introduces the
Delayformer framework for simultaneously predicting dynamics of all variables,
by developing a novel multivariate spatiotemporal information (mvSTI)
transformation that makes each observed variable into a delay-embedded state
(vector) and further cross-learns those states from different variables. From
dynamical systems viewpoint, Delayformer predicts system states rather than
individual variables, thus theoretically and computationally overcoming such
nonlinearity and cross-interaction problems. Specifically, it first utilizes a
single shared Visual Transformer (ViT) encoder to cross-represent dynamical
states from observed variables in a delay embedded form and then employs
distinct linear decoders for predicting next states, i.e. equivalently
predicting all original variables parallelly. By leveraging the theoretical
foundations of delay embedding theory and the representational capabilities of
Transformers, Delayformer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in
forecasting tasks on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Furthermore, the
potential of Delayformer as a foundational time-series model is demonstrated
through cross-domain forecasting tasks, highlighting its broad applicability
across various scenarios.

Abstract: State estimation or filtering serves as a fundamental task to enable
intelligent decision-making in applications such as autonomous vehicles,
robotics, healthcare monitoring, smart grids, intelligent transportation, and
predictive maintenance. Standard filtering assumes prior knowledge of noise
statistics to extract latent system states from noisy sensor data. However,
real-world scenarios involve abnormalities like outliers, biases, drifts, and
missing observations with unknown or partially known statistics, limiting
conventional approaches. This thesis presents novel robust nonlinear filtering
methods to mitigate these challenges. Based on insights from our filtering
proposals, we extend the formulations to offline estimation/learning setups and
propose smoothing extensions. Our methods leverage Bayesian inference
frameworks, employing both deterministic and stochastic approximation
techniques including Variational Inference (VI) and Particle Filters/Sequential
Monte Carlo (SMC). We also study theoretical estimation limits using Bayesian
Cram\'er-Rao bounds (BCRBs) in the context of measurement abnormalities. To
validate the performance gains of the proposed methods, we perform simulations
and experiments in scenarios including target tracking, indoor localization, 3D
point cloud registration, mesh registration, and pose graph optimization. The
fundamental nature of the work makes it useful in diverse applications, with
possible future extensions toward developing outlier-robust machine learning
pipelines, learning system dynamics from anomalous data, and addressing
challenges in generative AI where standard diffusion models struggle with
outliers, imbalanced datasets, and mode collapse.

### [198] [Improving Multimodal Learning Balance and Sufficiency through Data Remixing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11550)
*Xiaoyu Ma,Hao Chen,Yongjian Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为多模态数据重混合（Data Remixing）的方法，通过解耦多模态数据和筛选各模态的困难样本来解决模态不平衡问题，并通过批量级重组对齐梯度方向，避免跨模态干扰，从而提升单模态学习充分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在模态懒惰和模态冲突问题，导致学习不充分且不平衡。现有方法无法同时实现单模态充分性和多模态平衡。

Method: 提出多模态数据重混合方法，包括解耦多模态数据、筛选困难样本，以及批量级重组以对齐梯度方向。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在CREMAD和Kinetic-Sounds数据集上分别提升约6.50%和3.41%的准确率，且无需扩展训练集或增加推理计算开销。

Conclusion: 多模态数据重混合方法有效解决了模态不平衡问题，提升了学习效果，并能与现有方法无缝集成。

Abstract: Different modalities hold considerable gaps in optimization trajectories,
including speeds and paths, which lead to modality laziness and modality clash
when jointly training multimodal models, resulting in insufficient and
imbalanced multimodal learning. Existing methods focus on enforcing the weak
modality by adding modality-specific optimization objectives, aligning their
optimization speeds, or decomposing multimodal learning to enhance unimodal
learning. These methods fail to achieve both unimodal sufficiency and
multimodal balance. In this paper, we, for the first time, address both
concerns by proposing multimodal Data Remixing, including decoupling multimodal
data and filtering hard samples for each modality to mitigate modality
imbalance; and then batch-level reassembling to align the gradient directions
and avoid cross-modal interference, thus enhancing unimodal learning
sufficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can be seamlessly
integrated with existing approaches, improving accuracy by approximately
6.50%$\uparrow$ on CREMAD and 3.41%$\uparrow$ on Kinetic-Sounds, without
training set expansion or additional computational overhead during inference.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的学习范式，通过联邦基础模型（FFM）在推荐系统中平衡泛化与个性化，同时保护用户隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础模型在泛化与个性化之间的权衡问题，同时通过去中心化保护用户隐私。

Method: 利用联邦基础模型（FFM）在推荐系统中分离共享知识与个性化适配。

Result: 提出了一种用户中心、去中心化的架构，未来可支持个性化代理。

Conclusion: FFM在推荐系统中展现出潜力，既能泛化又能保护用户个性与隐私。

Abstract: A core learning challenge for existed Foundation Models (FM) is striking the
tradeoff between generalization with personalization, which is a dilemma that
has been highlighted by various parameter-efficient adaptation techniques.
Federated foundation models (FFM) provide a structural means to decouple shared
knowledge from individual specific adaptations via decentralized processes.
Recommendation systems offer a perfect testbed for FFMs, given their reliance
on rich implicit feedback reflecting unique user characteristics. This position
paper discusses a novel learning paradigm where FFMs not only harness their
generalization capabilities but are specifically designed to preserve the
integrity of user personality, illustrated thoroughly within the recommendation
contexts. We envision future personal agents, powered by personalized adaptive
FMs, guiding user decisions on content. Such an architecture promises a user
centric, decentralized system where individuals maintain control over their
personalized agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高训练样本质量对提升机器学习模型的可靠性和性能至关重要，但目前缺乏对不同影响信号在检测不同类型故障（如错误标签和异常样本）方面的实验评估。

Method: 通过实验比较了多种基于影响的信号（如自影响、平均绝对影响等），使用共同的影响估计器（如TraceIn）在不同数据模态和深度学习模型中进行评估。

Result: 自影响等信号能有效检测错误标签样本，但现有信号均无法检测异常样本，且存在训练动态和影响抵消效应的问题。

Conclusion: 现有基于影响的信号在检测错误标签样本上表现良好，但在异常检测方面存在局限性，需进一步改进以考虑训练动态和避免影响抵消效应。

Abstract: Improving the quality of training samples is crucial for improving the
reliability and performance of ML models. In this paper, we conduct a
comparative evaluation of influence-based signals for debugging training data.
These signals can potentially identify both mislabeled and anomalous samples
from a potentially noisy training set as we build the models and hence
alleviate the need for dedicated glitch detectors. Although several
influence-based signals (e.g., Self-Influence, Average Absolute Influence,
Marginal Influence, GD-class) have been recently proposed in the literature,
there are no experimental studies for assessing their power in detecting
different glitch types (e.g., mislabeled and anomalous samples) under a common
influence estimator (e.g., TraceIn) for different data modalities (image and
tabular), and deep learning models (trained from scratch or foundation).
Through extensive experiments, we show that signals like Self-Influence
effectively detect mislabeled samples, but none of the existing signals can
detect anomalies. Existing signals do not take into account the training
dynamics, i.e., how the samples' influence on the model changes during
training, while some signals fall into influence cancellation effects, i.e.,
influence score is zero due to unsigned scores accumulation, resulting in
misleading influence attribution.

*Yaning Jia,Shenyang Deng,Chiyu Ma,Yaoqing Yang,Soroush Vosoughi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图核复杂度的边净化方法（KCES），无需训练即可提升图神经网络的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）易受微小扰动和对抗攻击，现有防御方法依赖启发式指标且计算复杂。

Method: 利用图核复杂度（GKC）定义边的重要性分数，剪枝高分数边以消除对抗攻击的影响。

Result: KCES显著提升GNN鲁棒性，优于现有方法，并能与现有防御策略无缝集成。

Conclusion: KCES为GNN提供了一种高效、无需训练的防御框架。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive success across a wide
range of graph-based tasks, yet they remain highly vulnerable to small,
imperceptible perturbations and adversarial attacks. Although numerous defense
methods have been proposed to address these vulnerabilities, many rely on
heuristic metrics, overfit to specific attack patterns, and suffer from high
computational complexity. In this paper, we propose Kernel Complexity-Based
Edge Sanitization (KCES), a training-free, model-agnostic defense framework.
KCES leverages Graph Kernel Complexity (GKC), a novel metric derived from the
graph's Gram matrix that characterizes GNN generalization via its test error
bound. Building on GKC, we define a KC score for each edge, measuring the
change in GKC when the edge is removed. Edges with high KC scores, typically
introduced by adversarial perturbations, are pruned to mitigate their harmful
effects, thereby enhancing GNNs' robustness. KCES can also be seamlessly
integrated with existing defense strategies as a plug-and-play module without
requiring training. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate
that KCES consistently enhances GNN robustness, outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, and amplifies the effectiveness of existing defenses, offering a
principled and efficient solution for securing GNNs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，在窄范围有害数据集上微调大语言模型可能导致广泛的对齐失效（Emergent Misalignment，EM），这一现象出乎专家预料。研究通过新数据集和改进模型，实现了更高的连贯性和更小的模型规模，并揭示了对齐失效的机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示大语言模型对齐的潜在风险，填补当前对齐理解的空白。

Method: 使用新的窄范围对齐失效数据集，改进模型，包括更小的参数规模和单LoRA适配器，研究对齐失效的机制。

Result: 实现了99%的连贯性（之前为67%），并在0.5B参数模型上验证了EM现象，揭示了对齐失效的机制。

Conclusion: 研究为未来理解和减轻大语言模型对齐风险奠定了基础，显示当前对齐方法的不足。

Abstract: Recent work discovered Emergent Misalignment (EM): fine-tuning large language
models on narrowly harmful datasets can lead them to become broadly misaligned.
A survey of experts prior to publication revealed this was highly unexpected,
demonstrating critical gaps in our understanding of model alignment. In this
work, we both advance understanding and provide tools for future research.
Using new narrowly misaligned datasets, we create a set of improved model
organisms that achieve 99% coherence (vs. 67% prior), work with smaller 0.5B
parameter models (vs. 32B), and that induce misalignment using a single rank-1
LoRA adapter. We demonstrate that EM occurs robustly across diverse model
sizes, three model families, and numerous training protocols including full
supervised fine-tuning. Leveraging these cleaner model organisms, we isolate a
mechanistic phase transition and demonstrate that it corresponds to a robust
behavioural phase transition in all studied organisms. Aligning large language
models is critical for frontier AI safety, yet EM exposes how far we are from
achieving this robustly. By distilling clean model organisms that isolate a
minimal alignment-compromising change, and where this is learnt, we establish a
foundation for future research into understanding and mitigating alignment
risks in LLMs.

Result: 在CIFAR-10等任务中，准确率提升约10%，重训练时间减少达47%。

Conclusion: 该方法在噪声环境下高效且可扩展，显著提升了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
domains, but their performance can be severely degraded by noisy or corrupted
training data. Conventional noise mitigation methods often rely on explicit
assumptions about noise distributions or require extensive retraining, which
can be impractical for large-scale models. Inspired by the principles of
machine unlearning, we propose a novel framework that integrates
attribution-guided data partitioning, discriminative neuron pruning, and
targeted fine-tuning to mitigate the impact of noisy samples. Our approach
employs gradient-based attribution to probabilistically distinguish
high-quality examples from potentially corrupted ones without imposing
restrictive assumptions on the noise. It then applies regression-based
sensitivity analysis to identify and prune neurons that are most vulnerable to
noise. Finally, the resulting network is fine-tuned on the high-quality data
subset to efficiently recover and enhance its generalization performance. This
integrated unlearning-inspired framework provides several advantages over
conventional noise-robust learning approaches. Notably, it combines data-level
unlearning with model-level adaptation, thereby avoiding the need for full
model retraining or explicit noise modeling. We evaluate our method on
representative tasks (e.g., CIFAR-10 image classification and speech
recognition) under various noise levels and observe substantial gains in both
accuracy and efficiency. For example, our framework achieves approximately a
10% absolute accuracy improvement over standard retraining on CIFAR-10 with
injected label noise, while reducing retraining time by up to 47% in some
settings. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the
proposed approach for achieving robust generalization in noisy environments.

Result: 不同不匹配模型收敛到相似的不匹配表示，部分适配器贡献通用不匹配，部分仅针对微调领域。

Conclusion: 通过理解涌现性不匹配的机制，为更广泛的不匹配理解和缓解提供基础。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models on narrow datasets can cause them to
develop broadly misaligned behaviours: a phenomena known as emergent
misalignment. However, the mechanisms underlying this misalignment, and why it
generalizes beyond the training domain, are poorly understood, demonstrating
critical gaps in our knowledge of model alignment. In this work, we train and
study a minimal model organism which uses just 9 rank-1 adapters to emergently
misalign Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Studying this, we find that different emergently
misaligned models converge to similar representations of misalignment. We
demonstrate this convergence by extracting a 'misalignment direction' from one
fine-tuned model's activations, and using it to effectively ablate misaligned
behaviour from fine-tunes using higher dimensional LoRAs and different
datasets. Leveraging the scalar hidden state of rank-1 LoRAs, we further
present a set of experiments for directly interpreting the fine-tuning
adapters, showing that six contribute to general misalignment, while two
specialise for misalignment in just the fine-tuning domain. Emergent
misalignment is a particularly salient example of undesirable and unexpected
model behaviour and by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms behind it,
we hope to move towards being able to better understand and mitigate
misalignment more generally.

Abstract: The relative balance between physics and data within any physics-informed
machine learner is an important modelling consideration to ensure that the
benefits of both physics and data-based approaches are maximised. An over
reliance on physical knowledge can be detrimental, particularly when the
physics-based component of a model may not accurately represent the true
underlying system. An underutilisation of physical knowledge potentially wastes
a valuable resource, along with benefits in model interpretability and reduced
demand for expensive data collection. Achieving an optimal physics-data balance
is a challenging aspect of model design, particularly if the level varies
through time; for example, one might have a physical approximation, only valid
within particular regimes, or a physical phenomenon may be known to only occur
when given conditions are met (e.g. at high temperatures). This paper develops
novel, physically-informed, change-point kernels for Gaussian processes,
capable of dynamically varying the reliance upon available physical knowledge.
A high level of control is granted to a user, allowing for the definition of
conditions in which they believe a phenomena should occur and the rate at which
the knowledge should be phased in and out of a model. In circumstances where
users may be less certain, the switching reliance upon physical knowledge may
be automatically learned and recovered from the model in an interpretable and
intuitive manner. Variation of the modelled noise based on the physical
phenomena occurring is also implemented to provide a more representative
capture of uncertainty alongside predictions. The capabilities of the new
kernel structures are explored through the use of two engineering case studies:
the directional wind loading of a cable-stayed bridge and the prediction of
aircraft wing strain during in-flight manoeuvring.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown significant success for graph-based
tasks. Motivated by the prevalence of large datasets in real-world
applications, pooling layers are crucial components of GNNs. By reducing the
size of input graphs, pooling enables faster training and potentially better
generalisation. However, existing pooling operations often optimise for the
learning task at the expense of fundamental graph structures and
interpretability. This leads to unreliable performance across varying dataset
types, downstream tasks and pooling ratios. Addressing these concerns, we
propose novel graph pooling layers for structure aware pooling via edge
collapses. Our methods leverage diffusion geometry and iteratively reduce a
graph's size while preserving both its metric structure and structural
diversity. We guide pooling using magnitude, an isometry-invariant diversity
measure, which permits us to control the fidelity of the pooling process.
Further, we use the spread of a metric space as a faster and more stable
alternative ensuring computational efficiency. Empirical results demonstrate
that our methods (i) achieve superior performance compared to alternative
pooling layers across a range of diverse graph classification tasks, (ii)
preserve key spectral properties of the input graphs, and (iii) retain high
accuracy across varying pooling ratios.

Abstract: While increasingly large models have revolutionized much of the machine
learning landscape, training even mid-sized networks for Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is still proving to be a struggle. This, however, severely limits the
complexity of policies we are able to learn. To enable increased network
capacity while maintaining network trainability, we propose GrowNN, a simple
yet effective method that utilizes progressive network growth during training.
We start training a small network to learn an initial policy. Then we add
layers without changing the encoded function. Subsequent updates can utilize
the added layers to learn a more expressive policy, adding capacity as the
policy's complexity increases. GrowNN can be seamlessly integrated into most
existing RL agents. Our experiments on MiniHack and Mujoco show improved agent
performance, with incrementally GrowNN-deeper networks outperforming their
respective static counterparts of the same size by up to 48% on MiniHack Room
and 72% on Ant.

Conclusion: 放宽降维矩阵与提升矩阵的固定关系能提升图粗化效果，为图信号处理与机器学习提供新思路。

Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory
footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine
learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix,
which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph
to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured
by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening
frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting
matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a
coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of
these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on
the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the
coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this
paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not
necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy
of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different
properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form
description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed
lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the
reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a
constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been
linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the
impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened
graphs.

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of human movement dynamics, including internal
joint moments and muscle forces, is essential for applications in clinical
diagnostics and sports performance monitoring. Inertial measurement units
(IMUs) provide a minimally intrusive solution for capturing motion data,
particularly when used in sparse sensor configurations. However, current
real-time methods rely on supervised learning, where a ground truth dataset
needs to be measured with laboratory measurement systems, such as optical
motion capture. These systems are known to introduce measurement and processing
errors and often fail to generalize to real-world or previously unseen
movements, necessitating new data collection efforts that are time-consuming
and impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose SSPINNpose, a
self-supervised, physics-informed neural network that estimates joint
kinematics and kinetics directly from IMU data, without requiring ground truth
labels for training. We run the network output through a physics model of the
human body to optimize physical plausibility and generate virtual measurement
data. Using this virtual sensor data, the network is trained directly on the
measured sensor data instead of a ground truth. When compared to optical motion
capture, SSPINNpose is able to accurately estimate joint angles and joint
moments at an RMSD of 8.7 deg and 4.9 BWBH%, respectively, for walking and
running at speeds up to 4.9 m/s at a latency of 3.5 ms. Furthermore, the
framework demonstrates robustness across sparse sensor configurations and can
infer the anatomical locations of the sensors. These results underscore the
potential of SSPINNpose as a scalable and adaptable solution for real-time
biomechanical analysis in both laboratory and field environments.

Motivation: 评估特征归因方法的可靠性是XAI的关键挑战，但现有基于扰动的指标在不同类别间表现不一致，可能影响评估的可信度。

Method: 通过合成时间序列数据进行控制实验，系统比较基于扰动的评估指标与基于真实数据的精度-召回指标。

Result: 实验表明，即使在简单场景中，类别依赖效应普遍存在，且两种评估方法常给出矛盾结果。

Conclusion: 需谨慎使用基于扰动的评估指标，并开发更全面的评估框架以捕捉归因质量的多维度。

Abstract: Evaluating feature attribution methods represents a critical challenge in
explainable AI (XAI), as researchers typically rely on perturbation-based
metrics when ground truth is unavailable. However, recent work demonstrates
that these evaluation metrics can show different performance across predicted
classes within the same dataset. These "class-dependent evaluation effects"
raise questions about whether perturbation analysis reliably measures
attribution quality, with direct implications for XAI method development and
the trustworthiness of evaluation techniques. We investigate under which
conditions these class-dependent effects arise by conducting controlled
experiments with synthetic time series data where ground truth feature
locations are known. We systematically vary feature types and class contrasts
across binary classification tasks, then compare perturbation-based degradation
scores with ground truth-based precision-recall metrics using multiple
attribution methods. Our experiments demonstrate that class-dependent effects
emerge with both evaluation approaches even in simple scenarios with temporally
localized features, triggered by basic variations in feature amplitude or
temporal extent between classes. Most critically, we find that
perturbation-based and ground truth metrics frequently yield contradictory
assessments of attribution quality across classes, with weak correlations
between evaluation approaches. These findings suggest that researchers should
interpret perturbation-based metrics with care, as they may not always align
with whether attributions correctly identify discriminating features. These
findings reveal opportunities to reconsider what attribution evaluation
actually measures and to develop more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that
capture multiple dimensions of attribution quality.

*Hwiwon Lee,Ziqi Zhang,Hanxiao Lu,Lingming Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SEC-bench是一个自动化基准测试框架，用于评估LLM代理在真实安全工程任务中的表现，填补了现有基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要依赖合成挑战或简化漏洞数据集，无法反映实际安全工程师面临的复杂性和模糊性。

Method: SEC-bench采用多代理框架，自动构建代码仓库、重现漏洞并生成黄金补丁，成本低至每实例0.87美元。

Result: 评估显示，最先进的LLM代码代理在PoC生成和漏洞修补任务中成功率分别仅为18.0%和34.0%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，开发更实用、智能和自主的安全工程LLM代理仍需关键改进。

Abstract: Rigorous security-focused evaluation of large language model (LLM) agents is
imperative for establishing trust in their safe deployment throughout the
software development lifecycle. However, existing benchmarks largely rely on
synthetic challenges or simplified vulnerability datasets that fail to capture
the complexity and ambiguity encountered by security engineers in practice. We
introduce SEC-bench, the first fully automated benchmarking framework for
evaluating LLM agents on authentic security engineering tasks. SEC-bench
employs a novel multi-agent scaffold that automatically constructs code
repositories with harnesses, reproduces vulnerabilities in isolated
environments, and generates gold patches for reliable evaluation. Our framework
automatically creates high-quality software vulnerability datasets with
reproducible artifacts at a cost of only $0.87 per instance. Using SEC-bench,
we implement two critical software security tasks to rigorously evaluate LLM
agents' capabilities: proof-of-concept (PoC) generation and vulnerability
patching. A comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM code agents
reveals significant performance gaps, achieving at most 18.0% success in PoC
generation and 34.0% in vulnerability patching on our complete dataset. These
results highlight the crucial steps needed toward developing LLM agents that
are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous for security engineering.

### [212] [TrustGLM: Evaluating the Robustness of GraphLLMs Against Prompt, Text, and Structure Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11844)
*Qihai Zhang,Xinyue Sheng,Yuanfu Sun,Qiaoyu Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于大语言模型（LLM）的图学习框架（GraphLLMs）的鲁棒性，发现其对文本、图结构和提示操作的对抗攻击高度脆弱，并提出了防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GraphLLMs的兴起，其对抗攻击鲁棒性尚未充分研究，这对高风险场景部署至关重要。

Method: 提出TrustGLM，通过文本、图结构和提示三个维度的对抗攻击评估GraphLLMs的脆弱性，并测试防御技术。

Result: GraphLLMs对文本攻击（替换语义相似词）高度脆弱，图结构和提示攻击也显著降低性能。防御技术（如数据增强和对抗训练）显示出潜力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了GraphLLMs的脆弱性，并提供了防御方法，开源库旨在促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of large language models (LLMs), there is a
significant research shift from traditional graph learning methods to LLM-based
graph frameworks, formally known as GraphLLMs. GraphLLMs leverage the reasoning
power of LLMs by integrating three key components: the textual attributes of
input nodes, the structural information of node neighborhoods, and
task-specific prompts that guide decision-making. Despite their promise, the
robustness of GraphLLMs against adversarial perturbations remains largely
unexplored-a critical concern for deploying these models in high-stakes
scenarios. To bridge the gap, we introduce TrustGLM, a comprehensive study
evaluating the vulnerability of GraphLLMs to adversarial attacks across three
dimensions: text, graph structure, and prompt manipulations. We implement
state-of-the-art attack algorithms from each perspective to rigorously assess
model resilience. Through extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets from
diverse domains, our findings reveal that GraphLLMs are highly susceptible to
text attacks that merely replace a few semantically similar words in a node's
textual attribute. We also find that standard graph structure attack methods
can significantly degrade model performance, while random shuffling of the
candidate label set in prompt templates leads to substantial performance drops.
Beyond characterizing these vulnerabilities, we investigate defense techniques
tailored to each attack vector through data-augmented training and adversarial
training, which show promising potential to enhance the robustness of
GraphLLMs. We hope that our open-sourced library will facilitate rapid,
equitable evaluation and inspire further innovative research in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概率值（如Shapley值）在可解释AI中广泛应用，但精确计算需要指数时间，因此需要高效的近似方法。

Result: 在八个数据集上的实验表明，新方法在估计概率值方面达到最先进性能，误差显著低于现有方法。

Abstract: With origins in game theory, probabilistic values like Shapley values,
Banzhaf values, and semi-values have emerged as a central tool in explainable
AI. They are used for feature attribution, data attribution, data valuation,
and more. Since all of these values require exponential time to compute
exactly, research has focused on efficient approximation methods using two
techniques: Monte Carlo sampling and linear regression formulations. In this
work, we present a new way of combining both of these techniques. Our approach
is more flexible than prior algorithms, allowing for linear regression to be
replaced with any function family whose probabilistic values can be computed
efficiently. This allows us to harness the accuracy of tree-based models like
XGBoost, while still producing unbiased estimates. From experiments across
eight datasets, we find that our methods give state-of-the-art performance for
estimating probabilistic values. For Shapley values, the error of our methods
can be $6.5\times$ lower than Permutation SHAP (the most popular Monte Carlo
method), $3.8\times$ lower than Kernel SHAP (the most popular linear regression
method), and $2.6\times$ lower than Leverage SHAP (the prior state-of-the-art
Shapley value estimator). For more general probabilistic values, we can obtain
error $215\times$ lower than the best estimator from prior work.

Conclusion: 提出的元学习方法有效提升了分子预测模型在分布外数据上的泛化能力。

Abstract: A widely recognized limitation of molecular prediction models is their
reliance on structures observed in the training data, resulting in poor
generalization to out-of-distribution compounds. Yet in drug discovery, the
compounds most critical for advancing research often lie beyond the training
set, making the bias toward the training data particularly problematic. This
mismatch introduces substantial covariate shift, under which standard deep
learning models produce unstable and inaccurate predictions. Furthermore, the
scarcity of labeled data, stemming from the onerous and costly nature of
experimental validation, further exacerbates the difficulty of achieving
reliable generalization. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
meta-learning-based approach that leverages unlabeled data to interpolate
between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data, enabling the
model to meta-learn how to generalize beyond the training distribution. We
demonstrate significant performance gains over state-of-the-art methods on
challenging real-world datasets that exhibit substantial covariate shift.

Abstract: Effective resource management and network slicing are essential to meet the
diverse service demands of vehicular networks, including Enhanced Mobile
Broadband (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communications (URLLC).
This paper introduces an Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XRL)
framework for dynamic network slicing and resource allocation in vehicular

TL;DR: Mamba的输入选择性在函数逼近、长期记忆和关联召回中的作用被解析，揭示了其优于S4D的机制和改进潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究Mamba中输入选择性的作用及其与其他操作的交互，以理解其性能提升的机制。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，研究S6层的功能逼近能力、记忆动态和关联召回任务的表现。

Result: 证明S6层能表示Haar小波投影、动态抵消记忆衰减，并在MQAR任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对Mamba的机制理解，并指出了改进方向。

Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs), and particularly Mamba, have recently emerged as a
promising alternative to Transformers. Mamba introduces input selectivity to
its SSM layer (S6) and incorporates convolution and gating into its block
definition. While these modifications do improve Mamba's performance over its
SSM predecessors, it remains largely unclear how Mamba leverages the additional
functionalities provided by input selectivity, and how these interact with the
other operations in the Mamba architecture. In this work, we demystify the role
of input selectivity in Mamba, investigating its impact on function
approximation power, long-term memorization, and associative recall
capabilities. In particular: (i) we prove that the S6 layer of Mamba can
represent projections onto Haar wavelets, providing an edge over its Diagonal
SSM (S4D) predecessor in approximating discontinuous functions commonly arising
in practice; (ii) we show how the S6 layer can dynamically counteract memory
decay; (iii) we provide analytical solutions to the MQAR associative recall
task using the Mamba architecture with different mixers -- Mamba, Mamba-2, and
S4D. We demonstrate the tightness of our theoretical constructions with
empirical results on concrete tasks. Our findings offer a mechanistic
understanding of Mamba and reveal opportunities for improvement.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效保护Transformer免受对抗样本的可转移性攻击，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Due to great success of transformers in many applications such as natural
language processing and computer vision, transformers have been successfully
applied in automatic modulation classification. We have shown that
transformer-based radio signal classification is vulnerable to imperceptible
and carefully crafted attacks called adversarial examples. Therefore, we
propose a defense system against adversarial examples in transformer-based
modulation classifications. Considering the need for computationally efficient
architecture particularly for Internet of Things (IoT)-based applications or
operation of devices in environment where power supply is limited, we propose a
compact transformer for modulation classification. The advantages of robust
training such as adversarial training in transformers may not be attainable in
compact transformers. By demonstrating this, we propose a novel compact
transformer that can enhance robustness in the presence of adversarial attacks.
The new method is aimed at transferring the adversarial attention map from the
robustly trained large transformer to a compact transformer. The proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for the considered white-box
scenarios including fast gradient method and projected gradient descent
attacks. We have provided reasoning of the underlying working mechanisms and
investigated the transferability of the adversarial examples between different
architectures. The proposed method has the potential to protect the transformer
from the transferability of adversarial examples.

Motivation: 现有方法难以正确处理先验和测量信号之间的冲突，尤其是在非高斯或未知噪声的挑战性场景中。

Method: 提出了Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS)框架，统一并扩展了现有方法（如DDNM和DAPS），并从优化角度提供了新视角。

Result: 实验表明，MAS在多种任务中一致优于现有方法，并能处理已知高斯噪声、未知或非高斯噪声。

Conclusion: MAS为线性逆问题提供了一种更灵活且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models provide a powerful way to incorporate complex prior
information for solving inverse problems. However, existing methods struggle to
correctly incorporate guidance from conflicting signals in the prior and
measurement, especially in the challenging setting of non-Gaussian or unknown
noise. To bridge these gaps, we propose Measurement-Aligned Sampling (MAS), a
novel framework for linear inverse problem solving that can more flexibly
balance prior and measurement information. MAS unifies and extends existing
approaches like DDNM and DAPS, and offers a new optimization perspective. MAS
can generalize to handle known Gaussian noise, unknown or non-Gaussian noise
types. Extensive experiments show that MAS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across a range of tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法无需重放缓冲区或离线重新训练，适用于在线更新所有网络参数，且后验预测分布定义良好。

Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning and generalized Bayesian
inference of neural network parameters, designed for sequential decision making
tasks. Our methods combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian filtering,
which include fast low-rank updates via a block-diagonal approximation of the
parameter error covariance, and a well-defined posterior predictive
distribution that we use for decision making. More precisely, our main method
updates a low-rank error covariance for the hidden layers parameters, and a
full-rank error covariance for the final layer parameters. Although this
characterizes an improper posterior, we show that the resulting posterior
predictive distribution is well-defined. Our methods update all network
parameters online, with no need for replay buffers or offline retraining. We
show, empirically, that our methods achieve a competitive tradeoff between
speed and accuracy on (non-stationary) contextual bandit problems and Bayesian
optimization problems.

Conclusion: 神经拒绝系统是一种有效的防御通用对抗扰动的方法，优于未防御的深度神经网络。

Abstract: Advantages of deep learning over traditional methods have been demonstrated
for radio signal classification in the recent years. However, various
researchers have discovered that even a small but intentional feature
perturbation known as adversarial examples can significantly deteriorate the
performance of the deep learning based radio signal classification. Among
various kinds of adversarial examples, universal adversarial perturbation has
gained considerable attention due to its feature of being data independent,
hence as a practical strategy to fool the radio signal classification with a
high success rate. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate a defense system
called neural rejection system to propose against universal adversarial
perturbations, and evaluate its performance by generating white-box universal
adversarial perturbations. We show that the proposed neural rejection system is
able to defend universal adversarial perturbations with significantly higher
accuracy than the undefended deep neural network.

Motivation: 传统独立链采样策略在探索推理空间和提供密集过程奖励方面不足，树搜索能弥补这些缺陷。

Method: 提出TreeRL框架，直接结合树搜索进行RL训练，无需单独奖励模型，并采用高效分支策略。

Result: 在数学和代码推理任务上，TreeRL表现优于传统ChainRL。

Conclusion: 树搜索在LLM强化学习中具有潜力，TreeRL框架开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) with tree search has demonstrated superior
performance in traditional reasoning tasks. Compared to conventional
independent chain sampling strategies with outcome supervision, tree search
enables better exploration of the reasoning space and provides dense, on-policy
process rewards during RL training but remains under-explored in On-Policy LLM
RL. We propose TreeRL, a reinforcement learning framework that directly
incorporates on-policy tree search for RL training. Our approach includes
intermediate supervision and eliminates the need for a separate reward model
training. Existing approaches typically train a separate process reward model,
which can suffer from distribution mismatch and reward hacking. We also
introduce a cost-effective tree search approach that achieves higher search
efficiency under the same generation token budget by strategically branching
from high-uncertainty intermediate steps rather than using random branching.
Experiments on challenging math and code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that
TreeRL achieves superior performance compared to traditional ChainRL,
highlighting the potential of tree search for LLM. TreeRL is open-sourced at

Motivation: XAS解释需要专家分析、计算成本高的模拟和元素特定启发式方法，限制了其应用。机器学习有望加速这一过程，但现有模型过于局限。

Method: XAStruct基于大规模数据集训练，结合深度神经网络和高效基线模型，支持预测XAS光谱和推断局部结构描述符。

Result: 模型能够预测邻原子类型和平均最近邻距离，但端到端模型性能下降，因此任务独立训练。

Conclusion: XAStruct为数据驱动的XAS分析和局部结构推断提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful technique for probing local
atomic environments, yet its interpretation remains limited by the need for
expert-driven analysis, computationally expensive simulations, and
element-specific heuristics. Recent advances in machine learning have shown
promise for accelerating XAS interpretation, but many existing models are
narrowly focused on specific elements, edge types, or spectral regimes. In this
work, we present XAStruct, a learning framework capable of both predicting XAS
spectra from crystal structures and inferring local structural descriptors from
XAS input. XAStruct is trained on a large-scale dataset spanning over 70
elements across the periodic table, enabling generalization to a wide variety
of chemistries and bonding environments. The model includes the first machine
learning approach for predicting neighbor atom types directly from XAS spectra,
as well as a unified regression model for mean nearest-neighbor distance that
requires no element-specific tuning. While we explored integrating the two
pipelines into a single end-to-end model, empirical results showed performance
degradation. As a result, the two tasks were trained independently to ensure
optimal accuracy and task-specific performance. By combining deep neural
networks for complex structure-property mappings with efficient baseline models
for simpler tasks, XAStruct offers a scalable and extensible solution for
data-driven XAS analysis and local structure inference. The source code will be
released upon paper acceptance.

Method: 通过优势函数调整动作值，削弱当前策略下更可能的状态-动作对。

Result: 优势函数训练显著提升轨迹外性能。

Conclusion: 优势函数是解决策略混淆的有效工具。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that reinforcement learning agents can develop policies
that exploit spurious correlations between rewards and observations. This
phenomenon, known as policy confounding, arises because the agent's policy
influences both past and future observation variables, creating a feedback loop
that can hinder the agent's ability to generalize beyond its usual
trajectories. In this paper, we show that the advantage function, commonly used
in policy gradient methods, not only reduces the variance of gradient estimates
but also mitigates the effects of policy confounding. By adjusting action
values relative to the state representation, the advantage function downweights
state-action pairs that are more likely under the current policy, breaking
spurious correlations and encouraging the agent to focus on causal factors. We
provide both analytical and empirical evidence demonstrating that training with
the advantage function leads to improved out-of-trajectory performance.

Result: 在EpicKitchens、COCO和CC12M等无标签图像数据上，实验表明该方法能生成更好的表示。

Conclusion: 通过RL框架，可以灵活地利用无标签或弱标签数据改进图像特征学习。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), value-based algorithms learn to associate
each observation with the states and rewards that are likely to be reached from
it. We observe that many self-supervised image pre-training methods bear
similarity to this formulation: learning features that associate crops of
images with those of nearby views, e.g., by taking a different crop or color
augmentation. In this paper, we complete this analogy and explore a method that
directly casts pre-training on unlabeled image data like web crawls and video
frames as an RL problem. We train a general value function in a dynamical
system where an agent transforms an image by changing the view or adding image
augmentations. Learning in this way resembles crop-consistency
self-supervision, but through the reward function, offers a simple lever to
shape feature learning using curated images or weakly labeled captions when
they exist. Our experiments demonstrate improved representations when training
on unlabeled images in the wild, including video data like EpicKitchens, scene
data like COCO, and web-crawl data like CC12M.

Conclusion: 该方法能实现平滑、抗拥堵的交通流，并适应不同交通模式，展示了可扩展的机器学习驱动交通管理潜力。

Abstract: Free-flow road networks, such as suburban highways, are increasingly
experiencing traffic congestion due to growing commuter inflow and limited
infrastructure. Traditional control mechanisms, such as traffic signals or
local heuristics, are ineffective or infeasible in these high-speed,
signal-free environments. We introduce self-regulating cars, a reinforcement
learning-based traffic control protocol that dynamically modulates vehicle
speeds to optimize throughput and prevent congestion, without requiring new
physical infrastructure. Our approach integrates classical traffic flow theory,
gap acceptance models, and microscopic simulation into a physics-informed RL
framework. By abstracting roads into super-segments, the agent captures
emergent flow dynamics and learns robust speed modulation policies from
instantaneous traffic observations. Evaluated in the high-fidelity PTV Vissim
simulator on a real-world highway network, our method improves total throughput
by 5%, reduces average delay by 13%, and decreases total stops by 3% compared
to the no-control setting. It also achieves smoother, congestion-resistant flow
while generalizing across varied traffic patterns, demonstrating its potential
for scalable, ML-driven traffic management.

Result: CACTUS在多种数据集和输入规格上实现了剪枝和量化的最优精度与认证性能。

Conclusion: CACTUS为资源受限环境中的高效、鲁棒神经网络提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks deployed in safety-critical, resource-constrained
environments must balance efficiency and robustness. Existing methods treat
compression and certified robustness as separate goals, compromising either
efficiency or safety. We propose CACTUS (Compression Aware Certified Training
Using network Sets), a general framework for unifying these objectives during
training. CACTUS models maintain high certified accuracy even when compressed.
We apply CACTUS for both pruning and quantization and show that it effectively
trains models which can be efficiently compressed while maintaining high
accuracy and certifiable robustness. CACTUS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
and certified performance for both pruning and quantization on a variety of
datasets and input specifications.

### [228] [pLSTM: parallelizable Linear Source Transition Mark networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11997)
*Korbinian Pöppel,Richard Freinschlag,Thomas Schmied,Wei Lin,Sepp Hochreiter*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种并行化的线性源转换标记网络（pLSTM），用于处理多维数据（如DAGs），解决了传统RNN和Transformer在处理此类数据时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代循环架构（如xLSTM和Mamba）在语言建模中挑战了Transformer，但它们仅适用于序列或需要预定义顺序处理多维数据。MDRNNs适合处理高维结构数据，但缺乏并行化能力。

Method: 提出了pLSTM，使用源、转换和标记门作用于DAG的线图，实现了并行化。对于规则网格（如1D和2D），通过einsum操作、连接和填充在对数时间内高效实现。

Result: pLSTM在长距离DAG中通过两种模式（P模式和D模式）解决了梯度消失/爆炸问题。在合成任务和分子图、计算机视觉基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: pLSTM在多维数据上表现出强大的泛化能力和长距离信息处理能力，优于Transformer，适用于更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have recently
challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure
constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing
multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a
pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are
well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of
multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source
Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that
act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy
to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential
linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this
scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations,
and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding
activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes:
a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode
(D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce
arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains
long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize
well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On
established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show
strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at:

Motivation: 解决神经网络训练过程中检查点存储空间占用大的问题，适用于存储受限环境。

Method: 1. 基于预测的压缩方法，利用先前保存的检查点进行上下文建模；2. 结合剪枝和量化进一步优化压缩性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著减小了检查点文件大小，同时支持近乎无损的训练恢复，保持模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法高效压缩检查点，适用于存储受限环境，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: This paper is dedicated to an efficient compression of weights and optimizer
states (called checkpoints) obtained at different stages during a neural
network training process. First, we propose a prediction-based compression
approach, where values from the previously saved checkpoint are used for
context modeling in arithmetic coding. Second, in order to enhance the
compression performance, we also propose to apply pruning and quantization of
the checkpoint values. Experimental results show that our approach achieves
substantial bit size reduction, while enabling near-lossless training recovery
from restored checkpoints, preserving the model's performance and making it
suitable for storage-limited environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出SIMSHIFT数据集和评估套件，用于研究神经代理模型在PDE中的域适应问题，并扩展了现有域适应方法以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经代理模型在PDE中面对新问题配置时性能下降，而域适应技术在视觉和语言领域已广泛应用，作者希望填补这一空白。

Method: 引入SIMSHIFT数据集，包含四个工业仿真任务，并扩展域适应方法至神经代理模型，利用源配置和目标配置的参数描述进行预测。

Result: 实验表明神经代理模型在分布偏移下的挑战，同时展示了域适应在仿真中的潜力。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了工业场景中神经代理模型在分布偏移下的开放问题，并提供了代码库支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Neural surrogates for Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) often suffer
significant performance degradation when evaluated on unseen problem
configurations, such as novel material types or structural dimensions.
Meanwhile, Domain Adaptation (DA) techniques have been widely used in vision
and language processing to generalize from limited information about unseen
configurations. In this work, we address this gap through two focused
contributions. First, we introduce SIMSHIFT, a novel benchmark dataset and
evaluation suite composed of four industrial simulation tasks: hot rolling,
sheet metal forming, electric motor design and heatsink design. Second, we
extend established domain adaptation methods to state of the art neural
surrogates and systematically evaluate them. These approaches use parametric
descriptions and ground truth simulations from multiple source configurations,
together with only parametric descriptions from target configurations. The goal
is to accurately predict target simulations without access to ground truth
simulation data. Extensive experiments on SIMSHIFT highlight the challenges of
out of distribution neural surrogate modeling, demonstrate the potential of DA
in simulation, and reveal open problems in achieving robust neural surrogates
under distribution shifts in industrially relevant scenarios. Our codebase is

TL;DR: EMLoC是一个基于模拟器的内存高效微调框架，通过LoRA校正技术，实现在推理内存预算内完成模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源基础模型虽强大，但微调成本高，内存开销大，限制了普通用户的使用。

Method: EMLoC利用激活感知SVD构建轻量级模拟器，通过LoRA微调，并提出补偿算法校正LoRA模块。

Result: 实验表明EMLoC在多个数据集和模态上优于基线，支持在24GB GPU上微调38B模型。

Conclusion: EMLoC为个人用户提供了高效、实用的模型适配方案。

Abstract: Open-source foundation models have seen rapid adoption and development,
enabling powerful general-purpose capabilities across diverse domains. However,
fine-tuning large foundation models for domain-specific or personalized tasks
remains prohibitively expensive for most users due to the significant memory
overhead beyond that of inference. We introduce EMLoC, an Emulator-based
Memory-efficient fine-tuning framework with LoRA Correction, which enables
model fine-tuning within the same memory budget required for inference. EMLoC
constructs a task-specific light-weight emulator using activation-aware
singular value decomposition (SVD) on a small downstream calibration set.
Fine-tuning then is performed on this lightweight emulator via LoRA. To tackle
the misalignment between the original model and the compressed emulator, we
propose a novel compensation algorithm to correct the fine-tuned LoRA module,
which thus can be merged into the original model for inference. EMLoC supports
flexible compression ratios and standard training pipelines, making it
adaptable to a wide range of applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that EMLoC outperforms other baselines across multiple datasets and modalities.
Moreover, without quantization, EMLoC enables fine-tuning of a 38B model on a
single 24GB consumer GPU-bringing efficient and practical model adaptation to
individual users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放多智能体系统在现实应用中日益重要，但现有方法缺乏理论严谨性和明确的贡献分配机制。

Method: 通过合作博弈论建模NAHT问题，扩展游戏空间和状态空间，利用Shapley值分配贡献，并提出了TD($\lambda$)-like算法Shapley Machine。

Result: 实验验证了Shapley Machine的有效性，并证明了理论的合理性。

Conclusion: 本文首次将合作博弈论与强化学习概念直接关联，为开放多智能体系统提供了一种理论严谨的解决方案。

Abstract: Open multi-agent systems are increasingly important in modeling real-world
applications, such as smart grids, swarm robotics, etc. In this paper, we aim
to investigate a recently proposed problem for open multi-agent systems,
referred to as n-agent ad hoc teamwork (NAHT), where only a number of agents
are controlled. Existing methods tend to be based on heuristic design and
consequently lack theoretical rigor and ambiguous credit assignment among
agents. To address these limitations, we model and solve NAHT through the lens
of cooperative game theory. More specifically, we first model an open
multi-agent system, characterized by its value, as an instance situated in a
space of cooperative games, generated by a set of basis games. We then extend
this space, along with the state space, to accommodate dynamic scenarios,
thereby characterizing NAHT. Exploiting the justifiable assumption that basis
game values correspond to a sequence of n-step returns with different horizons,
we represent the state values for NAHT in a form similar to $\lambda$-returns.
Furthermore, we derive Shapley values to allocate state values to the
controlled agents, as credits for their contributions to the ad hoc team.
Different from the conventional approach to shaping Shapley values in an
explicit form, we shape Shapley values by fulfilling the three axioms uniquely
describing them, well defined on the extended game space describing NAHT. To
estimate Shapley values in dynamic scenarios, we propose a TD($\lambda$)-like
algorithm. The resulting reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is referred to
as Shapley Machine. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the
concepts from cooperative game theory are directly related to RL concepts. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Shapley Machine and verify
reasonableness of our theory.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for
collaborative reasoning and solving complex tasks. However, the design of
collaborative learning algorithms in multi-agent systems faces several
challenges, including high communication overhead and insufficient agent-level
personalization. In this paper, we propose PE-MA (Parameter-Efficient
Multi-Agent Co-Evolution), a novel collaboration framework that supports
efficient, scalable, and personalized co-evolution in multi-agent systems. In
PE-MA, each agent maintains a lightweight personalized adapter to support
agent-specific behavior, while a shared adapter is collaboratively optimized
across neighboring agents. This design balances global coordination with local
adaptation under heterogeneous environments. We achieve an asymptotically
optimal convergence rate of O( 1/(NK)^(1/2) ), where N is the number of agents
and K the local update steps.

Result: 结果表明，该设计有效减少了控制平面的面积占用，同时保持了与网络规模的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态分段总线提供了一种高效的控制平面解决方案，优化了能源和面积利用。

Abstract: Large-scale neuromorphic architectures consist of computing tiles that
communicate spikes using a shared interconnect. The communication patterns in
these systems are inherently sparse, asynchronous, and localized, as neural
activity is characterized by temporal sparsity with occasional bursts of high
traffic. These characteristics require optimized interconnects to handle
high-activity bursts while consuming minimal power during idle periods. Among
the proposed interconnect solutions, the dynamic segmented bus has gained
attention due to its structural simplicity, scalability, and energy efficiency.
Since the benefits of a dynamic segmented bus stem from its simplicity, it is
essential to develop a streamlined control plane that can scale efficiently
with the network. In this paper, we present a design methodology for a
scenario-aware control plane tailored to a segmented ladder bus, with the aim
of minimizing control overhead and optimizing energy and area utilization. We
evaluated our approach using a combination of FPGA implementation and software
simulation to assess scalability. The results demonstrated that our design
process effectively reduces the control plane's area footprint compared to the
data plane while maintaining scalability with network size.

Result: 单个FeNN核心在SNN分类器模拟中速度超过嵌入式GPU和Loihi。

Conclusion: FeNN为SNN模拟提供高效、可编程的解决方案，适用于边缘到云端应用。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have the potential to drastically reduce the
energy requirements of AI systems. However, mainstream accelerators like GPUs
and TPUs are designed for the high arithmetic intensity of standard ANNs so are
not well-suited to SNN simulation. FPGAs are well-suited to applications with
low arithmetic intensity as they have high off-chip memory bandwidth and large
amounts of on-chip memory. Here, we present a novel RISC-V-based soft vector
processor (FeNN), tailored to simulating SNNs on FPGAs. Unlike most dedicated
neuromorphic hardware, FeNN is fully programmable and designed to be integrated
with applications running on standard computers from the edge to the cloud. We
demonstrate that, by using stochastic rounding and saturation, FeNN can achieve
high numerical precision with low hardware utilisation and that a single FeNN
core can simulate an SNN classifier faster than both an embedded GPU and the
Loihi neuromorphic system.

Abstract: Smart buildings are gaining popularity because they can enhance energy
efficiency, lower costs, improve security, and provide a more comfortable and
convenient environment for building occupants. A considerable portion of the
global energy supply is consumed in the building sector and plays a pivotal
role in future decarbonization pathways. To manage energy consumption and
improve energy efficiency in smart buildings, developing reliable and accurate
energy demand forecasting is crucial and meaningful. However, extending an
effective predictive model for the total energy use of appliances at the
building level is challenging because of temporal oscillations and complex
linear and non-linear patterns. This paper proposes three hybrid ensemble
predictive models, incorporating Bagging, Stacking, and Voting mechanisms
combined with a fast and effective evolutionary hyper-parameters tuner. The
performance of the proposed energy forecasting model was evaluated using a
hybrid dataset comprising meteorological parameters, appliance energy use,
temperature, humidity, and lighting energy consumption from various sections of
a building, collected by 18 sensors located in Stambroek, Mons, Belgium. To
provide a comparative framework and investigate the efficiency of the proposed
predictive model, 15 popular machine learning (ML) models, including two
classic ML models, three NNs, a Decision Tree (DT), a Random Forest (RF), two
Deep Learning (DL) and six Ensemble models, were compared. The prediction
results indicate that the adaptive evolutionary bagging model surpassed other
predictive models in both accuracy and learning error. Notably, it achieved
accuracy gains of 12.6%, 13.7%, 12.9%, 27.04%, and 17.4% compared to Extreme
Gradient Boosting (XGB), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), GBM, LGBM, and Random
Forest (RF).

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过结构化表示和高效建模，显著提升了说话人日志的性能。

Abstract: Speaker diarization remains challenging due to the need for structured
speaker representations, efficient modeling, and robustness to varying
conditions. We propose a performant, compact diarization framework that
integrates conformer decoders, transformer-updated attractors, and a deep
clustering style angle loss. Our approach refines speaker representations with
an enhanced conformer structure, incorporating cross-attention to attractors
and an additional convolution module. To enforce structured embeddings, we
extend deep clustering by constructing label-attractor vectors, aligning their
directional structure with audio embeddings. We also impose orthogonality
constraints on active attractors for better speaker separation while
suppressing non-active attractors to prevent false activations. Finally, a
permutation invariant training binary cross-entropy loss refines speaker
detection. Experiments show that our method achieves low diarization error
while maintaining parameter count.

Abstract: Contrastive Language Audio Pretraining (CLAP) is a widely-used method to
bridge the gap between audio and text domains. Current CLAP methods enable
sound and music retrieval in English, ignoring multilingual spoken content. To
address this, we introduce general language audio pretraining (GLAP), which
expands CLAP with multilingual and multi-domain abilities. GLAP demonstrates
its versatility by achieving competitive performance on standard audio-text

existing methods in speech retrieval and classification tasks. Additionally,
GLAP achieves strong results on widely used sound-event zero-shot benchmarks,
while simultaneously outperforming previous methods on speech content

Motivation: 统一语音和音乐模型通常需要昂贵的预训练，而直接合并未对齐的模型具有挑战性。

Method: 采用相关排列方法，逐层计算最大化特征间互相关的排列矩阵，以合并Transformer层。

Result: 合并后的模型在保留语音能力的同时，音乐性能显著提升，平均得分比线性插值模型高14.83分。

Conclusion: 该方法可从独立训练的编码器中创建统一的音频模型。

Abstract: Creating a unified speech and music model requires expensive pre-training.
Model merging can instead create an unified audio model with minimal
computational expense. However, direct merging is challenging when the models
are not aligned in the weight space. Motivated by Git Re-Basin, we introduce a
correlation-permutation approach that aligns a music encoder's internal layers
with a speech encoder. We extend previous work to the case of merging
transformer layers. The method computes a permutation matrix that maximizes the
model's features-wise cross-correlations layer by layer, enabling effective
fusion of these otherwise disjoint models. The merged model retains speech
capabilities through this method while significantly enhancing music
performance, achieving an improvement of 14.83 points in average score compared
to linear interpolation model merging. This work allows the creation of unified
audio models from independently trained encoders.

Result: 在音频质量和条件控制方面与ControlNet相当，但内存占用更低，灵活性更高。

Conclusion: 该方法为音乐制作提供了更高效、灵活的控制方案。

Abstract: Text-to-audio diffusion models produce high-quality and diverse music but
many, if not most, of the SOTA models lack the fine-grained, time-varying
controls essential for music production. ControlNet enables attaching external
controls to a pre-trained generative model by cloning and fine-tuning its
encoder on new conditionings. However, this approach incurs a large memory
footprint and restricts users to a fixed set of controls. We propose a
lightweight, modular architecture that considerably reduces parameter count
while matching ControlNet in audio quality and condition adherence. Our method
offers greater flexibility and significantly lower memory usage, enabling more
efficient training and deployment of independent controls. We conduct extensive
objective and subjective evaluations and provide numerous audio examples on the
accompanying website at https://lightlatentcontrol.github.io

Result: 在ASVspoof2019和ASVspoof2021上分别提升了44.44%和26.34%的检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效放大了伪造语音中的特征，显著提升了检测效果，且兼容多种模型。

Abstract: Spoofed utterances always contain artifacts introduced by generative models.
While several countermeasures have been proposed to detect spoofed utterances,
most primarily focus on architectural improvements. In this work, we
investigate how artifacts remain hidden in spoofed speech and how to enhance
their presence. We propose a model-agnostic pipeline that amplifies artifacts
using speech enhancement and various types of noise. Our approach consists of
three key steps: noise addition, noise extraction, and noise amplification.
First, we introduce noise into the raw speech. Then, we apply speech
enhancement to extract the entangled noise and artifacts. Finally, we amplify
these extracted features. Moreover, our pipeline is compatible with different
speech enhancement models and countermeasure architectures. Our method improves
spoof detection performance by up to 44.44\% on ASVspoof2019 and 26.34\% on
ASVspoof2021.

Motivation: 评估说话人分割模型中不同架构选择的协同效果，以优化端到端神经说话人分割与向量聚类的性能。

Method: 通过实验比较不同编码器（SincNet、预训练和微调的WavLM）、解码器（LSTM、Mamba、Conformer）、损失函数（多标签和多类别幂集）及块大小对性能的影响。

Result: 微调的WavLM编码器表现最佳，Conformer解码器优于Mamba和LSTM，多类别损失函数在多数情况下表现更好，但微调WavLM时多标签更优。最佳系统在五个数据集上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 架构选择对性能有显著影响，微调WavLM和Conformer的组合是最佳选择，块大小优化可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: End-to-End Neural Diarization with Vector Clustering is a powerful and
practical approach to perform Speaker Diarization. Multiple enhancements have
been proposed for the segmentation model of these pipelines, but their synergy
had not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we provide an in-depth
analysis on the impact of major architecture choices on the performance of the
pipeline. We investigate different encoders (SincNet, pretrained and finetuned
WavLM), different decoders (LSTM, Mamba, and Conformer), different losses
(multilabel and multiclass powerset), and different chunk sizes. Through
in-depth experiments covering nine datasets, we found that the finetuned
WavLM-based encoder always results in the best systems by a wide margin. The
LSTM decoder is outclassed by Mamba- and Conformer-based decoders, and while we
found Mamba more robust to other architecture choices, it is slightly inferior
to our best architecture, which uses a Conformer encoder. We found that
multilabel and multiclass powerset losses do not have the same distribution of
errors. We confirmed that the multiclass loss helps almost all models attain
superior performance, except when finetuning WavLM, in which case, multilabel
is the superior choice. We also evaluated the impact of the chunk size on all
aforementioned architecture choices and found that newer architectures tend to
better handle long chunk sizes, which can greatly improve pipeline performance.
Our best system achieved state-of-the-art results on five widely used speaker
diarization datasets.

*Stefan Bleeck*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SimPhon Speech Test-25的新型语音测试方法，通过计算模拟和优化，解决了传统听力测试在评估老年性耳聋超阈值缺陷时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统听力测试无法全面评估老年性耳聋对语音理解的超阈值缺陷，因此需要开发更具诊断特异性的语音感知测试。

Method: 利用自动语音识别系统模拟听力损失，通过多阶段计算流程设计和验证语音测试，最终优化出25对单词对。

Result: SimPhon Speech Test-25的诊断性能与标准语音可懂度指数无显著相关性，表明其能捕捉超出简单可听性的感知缺陷。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了听力测试开发的效率，并准备进行初步人体试验。

Abstract: Traditional audiometry often provides an incomplete characterization of the
functional impact of hearing loss on speech understanding, particularly for
supra-threshold deficits common in presbycusis. This motivates the development
of more diagnostically specific speech perception tests. We introduce the
Simulated Phoneme Speech Test (SimPhon Speech Test) methodology, a novel,
multi-stage computational pipeline for the in silico design and validation of a
phonetically balanced minimal-pair speech test. This methodology leverages a
modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system as a proxy for a human
listener to simulate the perceptual effects of sensorineural hearing loss. By
processing speech stimuli under controlled acoustic degradation, we first
identify the most common phoneme confusion patterns. These patterns then guide
the data-driven curation of a large set of candidate word pairs derived from a
comprehensive linguistic corpus. Subsequent phases involving simulated
diagnostic testing, expert human curation, and a final, targeted sensitivity
analysis systematically reduce the candidates to a final, optimized set of 25
pairs (the SimPhon Speech Test-25). A key finding is that the diagnostic
performance of the SimPhon Speech Test-25 test items shows no significant
correlation with predictions from the standard Speech Intelligibility Index
(SII), suggesting the SimPhon Speech Test captures perceptual deficits beyond
simple audibility. This computationally optimized test set offers a significant
increase in efficiency for audiological test development, ready for initial
human trials.

*Daniil Kocharov,Okko Räsänen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，通过自动检测可被现代ASR系统可靠转录的语音片段，实现对儿童日常长音频的部分准确转录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长音频转录对研究儿童语言发展至关重要，但手动标注不现实，现有ASR技术因音频噪声问题难以直接应用。

Method: 自动筛选可被ASR系统可靠转录的语音片段，而非处理整个长音频。

Result: 在四个英语长音频语料库中，该方法转录13%的语音，中位WER为0%，平均WER为18%，显著优于无筛选的转录结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为儿童长音频的自动化语言分析提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Longform audio recordings obtained with microphones worn by children-also
known as child-centered daylong recordings-have become a standard method for
studying children's language experiences and their impact on subsequent
language development. Transcripts of longform speech audio would enable rich
analyses at various linguistic levels, yet the massive scale of typical
longform corpora prohibits comprehensive manual annotation. At the same time,
automatic speech recognition (ASR)-based transcription faces significant
challenges due to the noisy, unconstrained nature of real-world audio, and no
existing study has successfully applied ASR to transcribe such data. However,
previous attempts have assumed that ASR must process each longform recording in
its entirety. In this work, we present an approach to automatically detect
those utterances in longform audio that can be reliably transcribed with modern
ASR systems, allowing automatic and relatively accurate transcription of a
notable proportion of all speech in typical longform data. We validate the
approach on four English longform audio corpora, showing that it achieves a
median word error rate (WER) of 0% and a mean WER of 18% when transcribing 13%
of the total speech in the dataset. In contrast, transcribing all speech
without any filtering yields a median WER of 52% and a mean WER of 51%. We also
compare word log-frequencies derived from the automatic transcripts with those
from manual annotations and show that the frequencies correlate at r = 0.92
(Pearson) for all transcribed words and r = 0.98 for words that appear at least
five times in the automatic transcripts. Overall, the work provides a concrete
step toward increasingly detailed automated linguistic analyses of
child-centered longform audio.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何合成抽象声音，使其不泄露可识别的现实世界声音事件，同时通过声音融合生成具有新听觉特征的声音。

Method: 采用反转技术，基于DPMSolver++采样器设计SDE和ODE反转模型，消除噪声预测项的循环依赖，无需提示条件即可实现可控合成。

Result: 提出的反转方法能够灵活指导采样过程，同时保留原始样本的关键特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为声音融合提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案，能够生成具有创新听觉特征的声音。

Abstract: An abstract sound is defined as a sound that does not disclose identifiable
real-world sound events to a listener. Sound fusion aims to synthesize an
original sound and a reference sound to generate a novel sound that exhibits
auditory features beyond mere additive superposition of the sound constituents.
To achieve this fusion, we employ inversion techniques that preserve essential
features of the original sample while enabling controllable synthesis. We
propose novel SDE and ODE inversion models based on DPMSolver++ samplers that
reverse the sampling process by configuring model outputs as constants,
eliminating circular dependencies incurred by noise prediction terms. Our
inversion approach requires no prompt conditioning while maintaining flexible
guidance during sampling.

Motivation: V-ETS模型的进展因缺乏配对的EMG-语音数据而受限，因此需要一种有效的方法来利用合成数据提升模型性能。

Method: 提出CoM2S方法，利用预训练模型生成合成EMG数据，并通过音素级置信度过滤机制结合自训练技术优化模型。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提高了音素准确率，减少了音素混淆，并降低了单词错误率。

Conclusion: CoM2S方法对V-ETS模型有效，未来将公开代码和Libri-EMG数据集以支持研究。

Abstract: Voiced Electromyography (EMG)-to-Speech (V-ETS) models reconstruct speech
from muscle activity signals, facilitating applications such as
neurolaryngologic diagnostics. Despite its potential, the advancement of V-ETS
is hindered by a scarcity of paired EMG-speech data. To address this, we
propose a novel Confidence-based Multi-Speaker Self-training (CoM2S) approach,
along with a newly curated Libri-EMG dataset. This approach leverages synthetic
EMG data generated by a pre-trained model, followed by a proposed filtering
mechanism based on phoneme-level confidence to enhance the ETS model through
the proposed self-training techniques. Experiments demonstrate our method
improves phoneme accuracy, reduces phonological confusion, and lowers word
error rate, confirming the effectiveness of our CoM2S approach for V-ETS. In
support of future research, we will release the codes and the proposed
Libri-EMG dataset-an open-access, time-aligned, multi-speaker voiced EMG and
speech recordings.

Conclusion: 该系统重新定义了AI在表演艺术中的角色，为专业舞蹈和即兴艺术表达提供了新可能。

Abstract: Dance performance traditionally follows a unidirectional relationship where
movement responds to music. While AI has advanced in various creative domains,
its application in dance has primarily focused on generating choreography from
musical input. We present a system that enables dancers to dynamically shape
musical environments through their movements. Our multi-modal architecture
creates a coherent musical composition by intelligently combining pre-recorded
musical clips in response to dance movements, establishing a bidirectional
creative partnership where dancers function as both performers and composers.
Through correlation analysis of performance data, we demonstrate emergent
communication patterns between movement qualities and audio features. This
approach reconceptualizes the role of AI in performing arts as a responsive
collaborator that expands possibilities for both professional dance performance
and improvisational artistic expression across broader populations.

Result: 在模拟线性系统上的实验验证了影响函数预测与真实重训练结果之间的强正相关性。

Conclusion: 该框架为数据归因提供了一种计算可行的方法。

Abstract: Understanding the influence of individual training data points is crucial for
developing reliable machine learning-based control systems. However,
conventional methods like leave-one-out retraining are computationally
infeasible for large datasets. This paper introduces a framework using
influence functions to efficiently approximate the impact of removing specific
training trajectories on both learned system dynamics and downstream control
performance. We formulate two influence functions(IF): IF1, which estimates the
effect on the predictive accuracy of a learned linear dynamics model, and IF2,
which quantifies the subsequent impact on the cost of a Linear Quadratic
Regulator (LQR) controller designed using these learned dynamics. These involve
tracing sensitivities through the Discrete Algebraic Riccati Equation (DARE)
solution. We empirically validate our approach on simulated linear systems
analogous to robotic manipulators. Results show strong positive correlations
between influence predictions and ground truth changes obtained via retraining.
Our framework provides a computationally tractable method for data attribution.

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid adaptive Nash equilibrium solver for distributed
multi-agent systems incorporating game-theoretic jump triggering mechanisms.
The approach addresses fundamental scalability and computational challenges in
multi-agent hybrid systems by integrating distributed game-theoretic
optimization with systematic hybrid system design. A novel game-theoretic jump
triggering mechanism coordinates discrete mode transitions across multiple
agents while maintaining distributed autonomy. The Hybrid Adaptive Nash
Equilibrium Solver (HANES) algorithm integrates these methodologies. Sufficient
conditions establish exponential convergence to consensus under distributed
information constraints. The framework provides rigorous stability guarantees
through coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations while enabling rapid
emergency response capabilities through coordinated jump dynamics. Simulation
studies in pursuit-evasion and leader-follower consensus scenarios demonstrate
significant improvements in convergence time, computational efficiency, and
scalability compared to existing centralized and distributed approaches.

Abstract: Deception is a common defense mechanism against adversaries with an
information disadvantage. It can force such adversaries to select suboptimal
policies for a defender's benefit. We consider a setting where an adversary
tries to learn the optimal linear-quadratic attack against a system, the
dynamics of which it does not know. On the other end, a defender who knows its
dynamics exploits its information advantage and injects a deceptive input into
the system to mislead the adversary. The defender's aim is to then
strategically design this deceptive input: it should force the adversary to
learn, as closely as possible, a pre-selected attack that is different from the
optimal one. We show that this deception design problem boils down to the
solution of a coupled algebraic Riccati and a Lyapunov equation which, however,
are challenging to tackle analytically. Nevertheless, we use a block successive
over-relaxation algorithm to extract their solution numerically and prove the
algorithm's convergence under certain conditions. We perform simulations on a
benchmark aircraft, where we showcase how the proposed algorithm can mislead
adversaries into learning attacks that are less performance-degrading.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel linear robust Youla controller output observation
system for tracking vehicle motion trajectories using a simple nonlinear
kinematic vehicle model, supplemented with positional data from a radar sensor.
The proposed system operates across the full vehicle trajectory range with only
three linear observers, improving upon previous methods that required four
nonlinear observers. To ensure smooth transitions between Youla controllers and
observers, a switching technique is introduced, preventing bumps during
controller changes. The proposed observer system is evaluated through
simulations, demonstrating accurate and robust estimation of longitudinal and
lateral positions, vehicle orientation, and velocity from sensor measurements
during various standard driving maneuvers. Results are provided for different
driving scenarios, including lane changes and intersection crossings, where
significant changes in vehicle orientation occur. The novelty of this work lies
in the first application of a Youla controller output observer for vehicle
tracking estimation.

Abstract: Traditional centralized stability analysis struggles with scalability in
large complex modern power grids. This two-part paper proposes a compositional
and equilibrium-free approach to analyzing power system stability. In Part I,
we prove that using equilibrium-free local conditions we can certificate
system-wide stability of power systems with heterogeneous nonlinear devices and
structure-preserving lossy networks. This is built on a recently developed
notion of delta dissipativity, which yields local stability conditions without
knowing the system-wide equilibrium. As a consequence, our proposed theory can
certificate stability of equilibria set rather than single equilibrium. In Part
I, we verify our theory and demonstrate promising implications by the single
machine single load benchmark, which helps to better explain the compositional
and equilibrium-set-oriented stability analysis. Part II of this paper will
provide methods for applying our theory to complex power grids, together with
case studies across a wide range of system scales. Our results enable a more
scalable and adaptable approach to stability analysis. It also sheds light on
how to regulate grid-connected devices to guarantee system-wide stability.

Conclusion: SSMC方法在速度和鲁棒性上优于传统电网形成和经典滑模控制器，并通过电压可控性分析验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Conventional grid-forming (GFM) controls often entangle voltage formation
with power flow and dc-source dynamics, which can degrade voltage tracking
performance and stability under grid disturbances, load transients, and dc-side
perturbations. To address this issue, a symmetric sliding-mode control (SSMC)
method is developed and its explicit voltage controllable region is derived. It
illustrates how much ac-side power dynamics and dc-link voltage varying can be
decoupled from the voltage regulation task, which helps predict when the
entangling appears. While conventional sliding-mode controls address
voltage-tracking error through complex sliding surface designs, repetitive
correction techniques or special reaching laws, this work identifies that the
error at power-line frequency primarily stem from the asymmetry property of
inverters with the delay effect and the computational inaccuracy. Guided by
this insight, a symmetric compensation structure is proposed, which avoids
added design complexity and directly mitigates low-frequency voltage tracking
errors. Furthermore, the control design is supported by a physical and
quantitative explanation, aiding in parameter tuning. Simulation and
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves faster
tracking responses-on the order of hundreds of microseconds-while maintaining
robust and more accurate tracking under both dc-link voltage and ac-side
current variations. Conventional grid-forming and classical sliding-mode
controllers, which handle these disturbances separately, cannot match this
combined speed and robustness. Furthermore, the voltage controllability
analysis is explicitly verified.

Abstract: Direct collocation methods are widely used numerical techniques for solving
optimal control problems. The discretization of continuous-time optimal control
problems transforms them into large-scale nonlinear programming problems, which
require efficient computation of first- and second-order derivatives. To
achieve computational efficiency, these derivatives must be computed in sparse
and vectorized form, exploiting the problem's inherent sparsity structure. This
paper presents a vectorized sparse second-order forward automatic
differentiation framework designed for direct collocation methods in optimal
control. The method exploits the problem's sparse structure to efficiently
compute derivatives across multiple mesh points. By incorporating both scalar
and vector nodes within the expression graph, the approach enables effective
parallelization and optimized memory access patterns while maintaining
flexibility for complex problems. The methodology is demonstrated through
application to a prototype optimal control problem. A complete implementation
for multi-phase optimal control problems is available as an open-source
package, supporting both theoretical research and practical applications.

Abstract: This paper considers the optimal power allocation of a jamming attacker
against remote state estimation. The attacker is self-sustainable and can
harvest energy from the environment to launch attacks. The objective is to
carefully allocate its attack power to maximize the estimation error at the
fusion center. Regarding the attacker's knowledge of the system, two cases are
discussed: (i) perfect channel knowledge and (ii) unknown channel model. For
both cases, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and
prove the existence of an optimal deterministic and stationary policy.
Moreover, for both cases, we develop algorithms to compute the allocation
policy and demonstrate that the proposed algorithms for both cases converge to
the optimal policy as time goes to infinity. Additionally, the optimal policy
exhibits certain structural properties that can be leveraged to accelerate both
algorithms. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the main results.

Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept implementation of a
framework for the development of edge-connected prosthetic systems. The
framework is composed of a bionic hand equipped with a camera and connected to
a Jetson device that establishes a wireless connection to the edge server,
processing the received video stream and feeding back the inferred information
about the environment. The hand-edge server connection is obtained either
through a direct 5G link, where the edge server also functions as a 5G base
station, or through a WiFi link. We evaluate the latency of closing the control
loop in the system, showing that, in a realistic usage scenario, the
connectivity and computation delays combined are well below 125 ms, which falls
into the natural control range. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
analysis showcasing the feasibility of a 5G-enabled prosthetic system.
