This study\ninvestigates multiple artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to help\nstandardize transtibial prosthetic socket design. Data from 118 patients were\ncollected by prosthetists working in the Dutch healthcare system. This data\nconsists of a three-dimensional (3D) scan of the residual limb and a\ncorresponding 3D model of the prosthetist-designed socket. Multiple data\npre-processing steps are performed for alignment, standardization and\noptionally compression using Morphable Models and Principal Component Analysis.\nAfterward, three different algorithms - a 3D neural network, Feedforward neural\nnetwork, and random forest - are developed to either predict 1) the final\nsocket shape or 2) the adaptations performed by a prosthetist to predict the\nsocket shape based on the 3D scan of the residual limb. Each algorithm's\nperformance was evaluated by comparing the prosthetist-designed socket with the\nAI-generated socket, using two metrics in combination with the error location.\nFirst, we measure the surface-to-surface distance to assess the overall surface\nerror between the AI-generated socket and the prosthetist-designed socket.\nSecond, distance maps between the AI-generated and prosthetist sockets are\nutilized to analyze the error's location. For all algorithms, estimating the\nrequired adaptations outperformed direct prediction of the final socket shape.\nThe random forest model applied to adaptation prediction yields the lowest\nerror with a median surface-to-surface distance of 1.24 millimeters, a first\nquartile of 1.03 millimeters, and a third quartile of 1.54 millimeters."}

Fair compromises are\nfound through optimising voter actions towards greater representation of voter\npreferences in the winning set. Experimental evaluation with real-world\nparticipatory budgeting data reveals a pattern in fair compromise: that it is\nachievable through projects with smaller cost."}

To address this, recent work has focused on few-step or\none-step generation by learning the average velocity field, which directly maps\nnoise to data. MeanFlow, a leading method in this area, learns this field by\nenforcing a differential identity that connects the average and instantaneous\nvelocities. In this work, we argue that this differential formulation is a\nlimiting special case of a more fundamental principle. We return to the first\nprinciples of average velocity and leverage the additivity property of definite\nintegrals. This leads us to derive a novel, purely algebraic identity we term\nInterval Splitting Consistency. This identity establishes a self-referential\nrelationship for the average velocity field across different time intervals\nwithout resorting to any differential operators. Based on this principle, we\nintroduce SplitMeanFlow, a new training framework that enforces this algebraic\nconsistency directly as a learning objective. We formally prove that the\ndifferential identity at the core of MeanFlow is recovered by taking the limit\nof our algebraic consistency as the interval split becomes infinitesimal. This\nestablishes SplitMeanFlow as a direct and more general foundation for learning\naverage velocity fields. From a practical standpoint, our algebraic approach is\nsignificantly more efficient, as it eliminates the need for JVP computations,\nresulting in simpler implementation, more stable training, and broader hardware\ncompatibility. One-step and two-step SplitMeanFlow models have been\nsuccessfully deployed in large-scale speech synthesis products (such as\nDoubao), achieving speedups of 20x."}

Specifically, we develop an incremental parameter-varying output\nfeedback control law to address control rate constraints, as well as state and\ncontrol amplitude constraints. The proposal is based on the concept of robust\npositively invariant sets and applies the extended Farkas' lemma to derive a\nset of algebraic conditions that define both the control gains and a robust\npositively invariant polyhedron that satisfies the control and state\nconstraints. These algebraic conditions are formulated into a bilinear\noptimization problem aimed at determining the output feedback gains and the\nassociated polyedral robust positively invariant region. The obtained\ncontroller ensures that any closed-loop trajectory originating from the\npolyhedron converges to another smaller inner polyhedral set around the origin\nin finite time, where the trajectory remains ultimately bounded regardless of\nthe persistent disturbances and variations in system parameters. Furthermore,\nby including the sizes of the two polyhedral sets inside the objective\nfunction, the proposed optimization can also jointly enlarge the outer set\nwhile minimizing the inner one. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our proposal in managing the specified constraints,\ndisturbances, and parameter variations."}

The first stage is modeled as a marginal prediction\nprocess, which classifies queries by trajectory type to encourage the model to\nlearn all categories of trajectories, providing comprehensive mode information\nfor the joint prediction module.

This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot\nlearn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's\nlifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a\nfactor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element\nAnalysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based\non accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide\npolicy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL\ncan only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward\nNormalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on\nestimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across\nsimulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and\nDoor-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies\nconsistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer\neffectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of\nlearning lifespan-guided tool use strategies."}

In this\nwork, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset\ndistillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes\ndecoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of\nquantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss\nas the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable\nfair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise\nstorage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\\times$\ngreater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy. Across\ndiverse bpc budgets, distillation losses, and backbone architectures, our\napproach consistently establishes better rate-utility trade-offs."}

As the state-of-the-art, branch and bound (BaB) is\na \"divide-and-conquer\" strategy that applies off-the-shelf verifiers to\nsub-problems for which they perform better. While BaB can identify the\nsub-problems that are necessary to be split, it explores the space of these\nsub-problems in a naive \"first-come-first-serve\" manner, thereby suffering from\nan issue of inefficiency to reach a verification conclusion. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce an order over different sub-problems produced by BaB,\nconcerning with their different likelihoods of containing counterexamples.\nBased on this order, we propose a novel verification framework Oliva that\nexplores the sub-problem space by prioritizing those sub-problems that are more\nlikely to find counterexamples, in order to efficiently reach the conclusion of\nthe verification. Even if no counterexample can be found in any sub-problem, it\nonly changes the order of visiting different sub-problem and so will not lead\nto a performance degradation. Specifically, Oliva has two variants, including\n$Oliva^{GR}$, a greedy strategy that always prioritizes the sub-problems that\nare more likely to find counterexamples, and $Oliva^{SA}$, a balanced strategy\ninspired by simulated annealing that gradually shifts from exploration to\nexploitation to locate the globally optimal sub-problems. We experimentally\nevaluate the performance of Oliva on 690 verification problems spanning over 5\nmodels with datasets MNIST and CIFAR10.

Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,\noverlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its\napplication to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The\nvariability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the\nlabel space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM\nfocuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained\nspatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations\nand cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing\npre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge\nto alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a\nfeature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same\nfeature space and efficiently combine different representations.

While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they\nrequire large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world\nfield deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant\nhuman resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this\nchallenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during\nmodel training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to\ndiversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we\nhypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to\nsuboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with\nfrequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we\npropose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)\nwhich masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed\naround crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level\ncontextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our\nextensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that\nmasking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and\nsignificantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual\nnavigation. In particular, we show that biasing the mask distribution toward\ncrop rows in CA-Cut is critical for enhancing both prediction accuracy and\ngeneralizability across diverse environments achieving up to a 36.9% reduction\nin prediction error. In addition, we conduct ablation studies to determine the\nnumber of masks, the size of each mask, and the spatial distribution of masks\nto maximize overall performance."}

However, achieving them jointly remains a\nchallenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for\nsimultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network\ncompressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce\ndesirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization,\nclass separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate\nthat large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and\nregularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem.\nIn addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across\ndiverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present\nstrong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates\nin standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing\nhidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset."}
