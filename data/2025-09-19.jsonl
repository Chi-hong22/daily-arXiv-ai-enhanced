However, this\npotential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric\ninconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical\nuse in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or\nfine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high\ncomputational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free,\ninference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step\nRecursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during\ninference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising\nstep to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages\noptical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space\nand selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels.\nDual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths\nto adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural\nsignals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned\nguidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and\nphotorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse\nbenchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory\nconsistency, and visual fidelity.

We argue that current\nperformance-based definitions are inadequate because they provide no clear,\nmechanism-focused roadmap for research, and they fail to properly define the\nqualitative nature of genuine intelligence. Drawing inspiration from the human\nbrain, we propose a new paradigm that shifts the focus from external mimicry to\nthe development of foundational cognitive architectures. We define True\nIntelligence (TI) as a system characterized by six core components: embodied\nsensory fusion, core directives, dynamic schemata creation, a\nhighly-interconnected multi-expert architecture, an orchestration layer, and\nlastly, the unmeasurable quality of Interconnectedness, which we hypothesize\nresults in consciousness and a subjective experience. We propose a practical,\nfive-level taxonomy of AGI based on the number of the first five measurable\ncomponents a system exhibits. This framework provides a clear path forward with\ndevelopmental milestones that directly address the challenge of building\ngenuinely intelligent systems. We contend that once a system achieves Level-5\nAGI by implementing all five measurable components, the difference between it\nand TI remains as a purely philosophical debate. For practical purposes - and\ngiven theories indicate consciousness is an emergent byproduct of integrated,\nhigher-order cognition - we conclude that a fifth-level AGI is functionally and\npractically equivalent to TI. This work synthesizes diverse insights from\nanalytical psychology, schema theory, metacognition, modern brain architectures\nand latest works in AI to provide the first holistic, mechanism-based\ndefinition of AGI that offers a clear and actionable path for the research\ncommunity."}

A central component of\nthis framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed\nsecurity layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large\nlanguage models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification,\nand cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee\ninter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and\naccess controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the\nidea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator\nAgent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In\naddition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on\nthese alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,\nand contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This\ndual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel\nAgents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic\nand adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt\ninjection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy\nbreaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural\ndesign, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different\nfamilies (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected\ninto a multi-agent conversational environment.

In this extended work, we present\nadvancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the\nnoise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.\nBuilding on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight\nTrajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending\nits applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual\nreality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera\ncalibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of\nvisual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an\nunsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB\ndatasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory\ndenoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.\nAdditionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such\nas Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,\nproviding a comprehensive benchmark. This work represents the first initiative\nto integrate vision-positioning projection for denoising noisy sensor\ntrajectories of out-of-sight agents, paving the way for future advances.

Despite their success, conventional skip connections\nexhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature\nconstraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of\nfeature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is\ntransmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The\nintra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale\nfeature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global\ncontextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\nDynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer\nconnectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two\ncomplementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module\naddresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden\nrepresentations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature\nrefinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the\nintra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on\nglobal contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature\nintegration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly\nincorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across\nCNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like\nnetworks."}

In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.\nSpecifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly\nparticipate in re-ranking candidate images.

By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method\nsupports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable\ndecision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To\nenable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query\ndeconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple\nsemantic components.

Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data\nefficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field\nof single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training\ndatasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR\nwas proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the\ncurrent method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific\ninformation, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these\nissues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does\nnot need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract\nhigh-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then\nfine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution\nand synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less\ntraining data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we\ntrain a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\\% of the original\ndataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB. In this case, diffusion model\nfine-tuning takes 4 hours, and SR model training completes within 1 hour, much\nshorter than the 11-hour training time with the full dataset."}

To overcome the aforementioned issues, we deliver a\nnovel one-step multi-view clustering method with adaptive low-rank anchor-graph\nlearning (OMCAL). To construct a high-quality CAG, OMCAL provides a nuclear\nnorm-based adaptive CAG learning model against information redundancy and noise\ninterference.

Recently, the Model Predictive Path\nIntegral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the\nfirst two challenges.

Nevertheless, the majority of current solutions are\nlimited to one technology (mostly Wi-Fi or 5G), constraining the maximum\naccuracy reachable. As different technologies work with different spectrums, we\nsee a necessity in integrating more than one technology to augment the coverage\narea. Hence, we take the advantage of ISAC passive sensing, to present FAWN, a\nMultiEncoder Fusion-Attention Wave Network for ISAC indoor scene inference.\nFAWN is based on the original transformers architecture, to fuse information\nfrom Wi-Fi and 5G, making the network capable of understanding the physical\nworld without interfering with the current communication. To test our solution,\nwe have built a prototype and integrated it in a real scenario. Results show\nerrors below 0.6 m around 84% of times."}

We propose a diverse query generation strategy that\nsimulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the\ndiscovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.\nBuilding on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to\nevolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and\nstealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR\nwhile preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and\npreviously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to\nreassess the shared instructional prompts."}

Traditional\ngradient-based training methods are inefficient, requiring numerous iterative\nupdates and high power consumption. To address these limitations, we propose a\nhybrid framework that combines hierarchical decomposition with FPGA-based\ndirect equation solving and incremental learning. Our method divides the neural\nnetwork into two functional tiers: lower layers are optimized via single-step\nequation solving on FPGAs for efficient and parallelizable feature extraction,\nwhile higher layers employ adaptive incremental learning to support continual\nupdates without full retraining. Building upon this foundation, we introduce\nthe Compound LLM framework, which explicitly deploys LLM modules across both\nhierarchy levels. The lower-level LLM handles reusable representation learning\nwith minimal energy overhead, while the upper-level LLM performs adaptive\ndecision-making through energy-aware updates.

However, the optimal configuration of this network of\nsensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for\nplacing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of\nthe hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile\nfeedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand\nobject reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different\nparts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning\ncontrol policies and investigate the relationship between object\ncharacteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing\nconfigurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of\nmanipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of\nanthropomorphic end-effectors with enhanced manipulation capabilities."}

The methodology\ninvolves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition,\nand model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high,\nthey proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently,\nmodels were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of\npredictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to\nguide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle\ncompetition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity,\nspecifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined\nwith carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain\ngap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded\nand diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's\nhidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only\ntraining approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully\ncapturing real-world variability."}

However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful\ntool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world\ntends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies\nacross different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a\nmethod, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque\nfeatures from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect\nanomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms\nof F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)\non four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better\nperformance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method\nof parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and\ndemonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several\nforceful tool use experiments."}

We\nfocus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical\nimages are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle\nthis, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills\nknowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from\nscratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models\nusing pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning\nrate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and\nunlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction\naccuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate\npseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets\ndemonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming\nthirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different\nsettings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic,\nallowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its\nadaptability as more advanced models emerge.

A key\nelement in sound simulation is the room impulse response (RIR), which\ncharacterizes how sound propagates from a source to a listener within a given\nspace. Recent studies have applied neural implicit methods to learn RIR using\ncontext information collected from the environment, such as scene images.\nHowever, these approaches do not effectively leverage explicit geometric\ninformation from the environment. To further exploit the potential of neural\nimplicit models with direct geometric features, we present Mesh-infused Neural\nAcoustic Field (MiNAF), which queries a rough room mesh at given locations and\nextracts distance distributions as an explicit representation of local context.\nOur approach demonstrates that incorporating explicit local geometric features\ncan better guide the neural network in generating more accurate RIR\npredictions. Through comparisons with conventional and state-of-the-art\nbaseline methods, we show that MiNAF performs competitively across various\nevaluation metrics.

A key challenge stems from\nthe lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric\nimages.

In this\npaper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of\nReinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation\npipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized\nfrom 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from\nmathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key\nfeatures of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization\nand yields non-trivial improvements.

These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable\nprediction in real-world scenarios.
