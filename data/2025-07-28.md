### [4] [Adapt, But Don't Forget: Fine-Tuning and Contrastive Routing for Lane Detection under Distribution Shift](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18653)
*Mohammed Abdul Hafeez Khan,Parth Ganeriwala,Sarah M. Lehman,Siddhartha Bhattacharyya,Amy Alvarez,Natasha Neogi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种解决跨数据集分布偏移导致灾难性遗忘的方法，通过分支微调和动态路由实现高效参数适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有车道检测模型在跨数据集分布偏移时会出现灾难性遗忘问题，需要一种参数高效的适应方法。

Method: 训练基础模型后，为目标分布创建分支并微调部分组件，使用监督对比学习动态路由输入。

Result: 框架在显著减少参数的同时实现了接近最优的F1分数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨数据集适应问题，同时保持了参数效率。

Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

### [5] [Part Segmentation of Human Meshes via Multi-View Human Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18655)
*James Dickens,Kamyar Hamad*

Main category: cs.CV

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在将点云深度学习与人体解析领域结合，实现大规模人体网格的顶点级语义分割。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不依赖纹理信息的情况下，实现人体网格的高精度语义分割。

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

### [6] [ShrinkBox: Backdoor Attack on Object Detection to Disrupt Collision Avoidance in Machine Learning-based Advanced Driver Assistance Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18656)
*Muhammad Zaeem Shahzad,Muhammad Abdullah Hanif,Bassem Ouni,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ShrinkBox的新型后门攻击，针对基于机器学习的ADAS中的物体检测系统，通过缩小边界框来干扰距离估计，攻击成功率高且隐蔽。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ADAS依赖昂贵传感器，限制了普及；ML-ADAS基于摄像头和DNN提供低成本方案，但其物体检测系统存在安全漏洞。

Method: 提出ShrinkBox攻击，通过轻微缩小边界框干扰距离估计，攻击YOLOv9m模型，仅需少量训练数据污染。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，攻击成功率达96%，污染率仅4%，下游距离估计误差增加3倍以上。

Conclusion: ShrinkBox攻击隐蔽且高效，凸显了ML-ADAS安全性的脆弱性，需加强防御措施。

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations,
such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class
imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant
advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ
from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model
for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the
Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with
77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for
l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER
of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve
a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.
Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust
performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the
KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing
suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the
digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural
diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music
traditions.

### [8] [VGS-ATD: Robust Distributed Learning for Multi-Label Medical Image Classification Under Heterogeneous and Imbalanced Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18657)
*Zehui Zhao,Laith Alzubaidi,Haider A. Alwzwazy,Jinglan Zhang,Yuantong Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为VGS-ATD的新型分布式学习框架，解决了传统集中式和分散式学习在隐私、数据异构性和效率方面的不足，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式学习存在隐私风险，而分散式方法（如联邦学习和群体学习）在处理异构数据时效率低下且易受灾难性遗忘影响。临床环境的动态复杂性需要可扩展的AI系统。

Method: 提出VGS-ATD框架，通过分布式学习在本地节点上训练模型，仅共享模型权重，同时解决数据异构性和灾难性遗忘问题。

Result: 在30个数据集和80个独立标签的实验中，VGS-ATD准确率达92.7%，优于集中式学习（84.9%）和群体学习（72.99%），且扩展后仅损失1%准确率。

Conclusion: VGS-ATD在隐私保护、效率和可扩展性方面表现优异，是解决医疗影像任务中分布式学习挑战的有效方案。

Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its
resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational
costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming
its superior efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Computer vision applications are omnipresent nowadays. The current paper
explores the use of fuzzy logic in computer vision, stressing its role in
handling uncertainty, noise, and imprecision in image data. Fuzzy logic is able
to model gradual transitions and human-like reasoning and provides a promising
approach to computer vision. Fuzzy approaches offer a way to improve object
recognition, image segmentation, and feature extraction by providing more
adaptable and interpretable solutions compared to traditional methods. We
discuss key fuzzy techniques, including fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference
systems, type-2 fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rule-based decision-making. The paper
also discusses various applications, including medical imaging, autonomous
systems, and industrial inspection. Additionally, we explore the integration of
fuzzy logic with deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to enhance performance in complex vision tasks. Finally, we examine
emerging trends such as hybrid fuzzy-deep learning models and explainable AI.

### [10] [Eyes Will Shut: A Vision-Based Next GPS Location Prediction Model by Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feed Back](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18661)

Result: 在四个城市的数据集上，方法达到了SOTA性能，并展现出优于其他基于LLM方法的跨城市泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结合视觉推理和强化学习的方法能够有效提升位置预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual
inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual
Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction
ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on
datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city
generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI如何自动化并提升嫌疑人素描的准确性和效率。

Method: 开发并评估三种模型：基础Stable Diffusion模型、结合CLIP的模型，以及引入LoRA微调的CLIP模型。

Result: 基础模型在SSIM和PSNR上表现最优，LoRA微调模型在感知相似性上有提升。

Conclusion: 基础模型在素描生成中表现最稳健，但微调方法仍有潜力。

Abstract: This project investigates the use of multimodal AI-driven approaches to
automate and enhance suspect sketching. Three pipelines were developed and
evaluated: (1) baseline image-to-image Stable Diffusion model, (2) same model
integrated with a pre-trained CLIP model for text-image alignment, and (3)
novel approach incorporating LoRA fine-tuning of the CLIP model, applied to
self-attention and cross-attention layers, and integrated with Stable
Diffusion. An ablation study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and
cross-attention layers yielded the best alignment between text descriptions and
sketches. Performance testing revealed that Model 1 achieved the highest
structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.72 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
25 dB, outperforming Model 2 and Model 3. Iterative refinement enhanced
perceptual similarity (LPIPS), with Model 3 showing improvement over Model 2
but still trailing Model 1. Qualitatively, sketches generated by Model 1
demonstrated the clearest facial features, highlighting its robustness as a
baseline despite its simplicity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了CLIP模型在UCF-101数据集上的动作识别表现，分析了三种掩码策略的影响，并提出通过类特定噪声增强模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在复杂动作识别中泛化能力不足，CLIP模型展现出潜力，但其在视频数据中的表现需进一步验证。

Method: 采用三种掩码策略（百分比/形状掩码、特征特定掩码、隔离掩码）测试CLIP模型，并提出类特定噪声增强方法。

Result: CLIP在视觉线索被遮挡时表现不稳定，类特定噪声方法提升了分类准确性和模型信心。

Conclusion: CLIP在临床应用中存在挑战，未来需改进其泛化能力以适应医疗场景。

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HeartUnloadNet是一种深度学习框架，用于直接从舒张末期网格预测左心室的无负载形状，结合生物物理先验，显著提高了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无负载心脏几何形状对个性化心脏功能建模至关重要，但传统方法计算成本高且复杂。

Method: 采用图注意力架构和循环一致性策略，结合生理参数，实现双向预测，减少对大数据集的依赖。

Result: 在20,700个有限元模拟上测试，精度达亚毫米级，推理时间仅0.02秒，比传统方法快10^5倍。

Conclusion: HeartUnloadNet是一种可扩展且准确的替代方案，支持未来实时临床应用。

Abstract: The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal
pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is
critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to
understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of
cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical
images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse
finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep
learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape
directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating
biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with
physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and
fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts
a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to
enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial
self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training
datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV
geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing
inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and
significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the
cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as
few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate
surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in
the future.

Conclusion: 该流程为开发感知和理解物理环境的AI系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it
remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the
abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors
and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that
converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic
3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and
pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale
calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery
and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically
generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce
data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.
We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can
benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based
reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for
developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting
with physical environments.

Conclusion: SaLF在保持真实感的同时提高了效率和功能，适用于更广泛的自动驾驶传感器仿真。

Abstract: High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance
field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting
of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving
scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through
rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,
preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both
NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit
networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing
interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present
Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports
rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D
voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast
training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS
LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,
and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that
SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods
while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable
simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于单目摄像头的自监督方法，用于预测可驾驶自由空间走廊，通过扩散模型和轮廓点表示改进预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖BEV表示，难以获取；而图像感知任务缺乏对应数据，需解决这些问题。

Method: 利用未来自车轨迹和图像生成自由空间样本，采用扩散模型（ContourDiff）基于轮廓点去噪预测。

Result: 在nuScenes和CARLA数据集上验证了方法的多模态导航走廊预测准确性。

Conclusion: ContourDiff通过结构化轮廓点表示，实现了更直观和高效的自由空间预测。

Abstract: Drivable Free-space prediction is a fundamental and crucial problem in
autonomous driving. Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the
entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to
estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road
region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a
BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame
drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using
only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several
challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space
corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel
self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future
ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual
corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion
process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the
existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.
Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture
that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask
representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.
We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and
CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal
navigable corridors in the image.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模高质量的SAR图像-文本数据集，SAR图像的语义理解受到限制。

Method: 设计了SAR-Narrator框架，通过多阶段渐进迁移学习生成SAR图像的文本描述，并构建了SAR-Text数据集。

Result: 在图像-文本检索、图像描述和视觉问答任务中，SAR-RS-CLIP、SAR-RS-CoCa和SAR-GPT模型表现显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SAR-Text数据集和SAR-Narrator框架为SAR图像的语义理解提供了有效工具，并展示了在视觉语言任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the
field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet
the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its
semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and
high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To
construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which
generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive
transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT
dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:
image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).
Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:
SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable
improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and
10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the
captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding
those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In
the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple
SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning
ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,
as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the
community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

Conclusion: 3D几何先验有效弥合模态差异，提升定位精度，方法高效且无需额外标注。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,
and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within
the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans
are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric
differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this
task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose
filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization
errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously
shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan
Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric
priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we
first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,
i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints
between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the
view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color
correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB
frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised
contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are
required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the
modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the
computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released
after the anonymous review.

Result: 实验证明该方法在新视角合成和新姿势动画中高效且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: Human Gaussian Graph能有效建模高斯与网格关系，提升动画效果。

Abstract: Modeling animatable human avatars from videos is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While conventional methods require per-instance
optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D
Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians
for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of
Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian
Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,
so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable
human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual
layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the
second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node
operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and
inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.
Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

Motivation: 解决车联网中传输原始点云或完整特征图导致的高延迟和可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用两阶段减少管道：选择性传输（ST）和自适应网格减少（AGR），结合软门控混合专家（MoE）注意力层进行特征融合。

Result: 在OPV2V基准测试中，EffiComm达到0.84 mAP@0.7，每帧仅传输约1.5 MB数据。

Conclusion: EffiComm展示了自适应学习通信在可扩展车联网感知中的价值。

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor
information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.
These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for
scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.

Conclusion: 迭代设计过程验证了注意力机制的必要性，为现代视觉语言任务提供了清晰的架构蓝图。

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural
language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural
principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于CNN的3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）初始化方法，解决了传统方法需要精确姿态和高计算成本的问题，适用于空间应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的新视角合成技术（如NeRF和3DGS）需要精确的姿态信息且计算成本高，限制了其在空间应用中的使用。

Method: 1. 使用CNN从单目图像初始化3DGS；2. 支持噪声或隐式姿态估计的训练流程；3. 分析不同初始化变体以减少训练成本。

Result: 方法显著减少了训练迭代次数和输入图像需求（至少一个数量级），并在不完美姿态监督下仍能学习高保真3D表示。

Conclusion: 该技术为空间应用中的新视角合成提供了可行性。

Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.

Conclusion: 研究挑战了直接图像处理的必要性，提出了一种更高效且参数更少的面部特征提取方法，适用于多种神经网络模型。

Abstract: The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the
authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images
generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more
difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new
models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted
to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional
neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly
interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using
solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of
both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an
approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on
identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image
processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction
technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial
landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance
metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings
discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models
with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering
around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing
is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature
extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while
requiring fewer parameters.

low-rank parameterisation of previous methods and show that Flow-SSNs can
estimate arbitrarily high-rank pixel-wise covariances without assuming the rank
or storing the distributional parameters. Flow-SSNs are also more efficient to
sample from than standard diffusion-based segmentation models, thanks to most
of the model capacity being allocated to learning the base distribution of the
flow, constituting an expressive prior. We apply Flow-SSNs to challenging
medical imaging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Code

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with
the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges
in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While
ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally
intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To
address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token
Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt
tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in
an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,
using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity
while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based
pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in
classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong
interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自动语音识别（V-ASR）因缺乏听觉线索和音素的视觉模糊性而具有挑战性，现有方法错误率高且需要大量数据。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过V-ASR预测音素并提取面部特征；第二阶段使用LLM模型NLLB将音素重建为单词。

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3数据集上分别实现了17.4%和21.0%的词错误率（WER）。

Conclusion: 提出的PV-ASR方法通过结合视觉和音素特征，显著提升了性能，为V-ASR任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that
involves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as
lip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to
the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit
similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing
methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but
they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require
large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage
framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM
model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of
V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training
complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific
facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,
that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large
visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates
superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the
LRS3 dataset.

Conclusion: MAT-Adv通过结构级扰动有效提升了对抗攻击的迁移性和不可防御性。

Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and
improving the robustness of 3D deep learning models. However, most existing
attack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer
from limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness
against common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel
adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and
undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)
representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting
point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point
clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric
structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,
MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain
effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting
and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the
optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and
undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and
undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

<details>

Motivation: 由于数据收集和标注成本高，伪装目标检测（COD）的数据集较少，尤其是某些特殊类别。合成数据可以缓解数据不足问题，但直接使用合成数据训练会导致模型性能下降。

Result: 实验证明CSRDA框架有效缓解了COD中数据不足和手工标注的问题。

Conclusion: CSRDA框架通过域适应方法提升了模型在真实场景中的性能，解决了合成数据与真实数据之间的性能差距问题。

Abstract: Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few
datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain
specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently
populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of
limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets
compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely
Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the
model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic
camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be
utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA
propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.
Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of
pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an

TL;DR: HQ-SMem是一种基于智能记忆的高质量视频分割与跟踪方法，通过结合SAM-HQ、动态智能记忆和动态外观模型更新，显著提升了视频对象分割的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象分割模型在精确掩码划分、可变形对象、拓扑变换对象、跟踪漂移和长视频序列处理方面存在不足。

Method: 1. 使用SAM-HQ和基于外观的候选选择优化粗分割掩码；2. 动态智能记忆机制选择存储关键帧；3. 动态更新外观模型处理复杂对象变化。

Result: 在多个公开数据集和基准测试中表现优异，尤其在VOTS和VOTSt 2024数据集上排名前二，并在长视频数据集上创下新纪录。

Conclusion: HQ-SMem有效解决了现有模型的局限性，在复杂场景和长视频中表现出色。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision
applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and
generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with
precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming
objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce
HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a
novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing
these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)
leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based
candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved
object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that
selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby
optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and
(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex
topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These
contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,
coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update
schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues
associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public
datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method
consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,
HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its
effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object
dynamics over extended temporal durations.

*Zhentao Huang,Di Wu,Zhenbang He,Minglun Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSSR提出了一种新方法，通过均匀分布高斯并优化其几何对齐，显著提升了3D高斯重建的几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯重建方法（如3DGS和PGSR）在几何重建上存在不足，高斯分布不均匀且偏离潜在表面，影响重建和编辑。

Method: GSSR结合像素级和高斯级的单视角法线一致性及多视角光度一致性，优化高斯分布和几何对齐，并引入不透明度正则化和周期性高斯重新初始化。

Result: 实验表明GSSR显著提升了高斯放置的几何精度，支持直观场景编辑和高效生成新3D环境。

Conclusion: GSSR在保持高质量渲染的同时，显著提升了几何重建的准确性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its
flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry.
While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper
depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual
placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that
deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement
and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we
propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to
distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their
dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric
alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view
normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both
local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we
introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and
apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a
cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results
demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,
enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel
Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's
effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving
high-quality rendering performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决红外图像目标检测中因RGB预训练权重与红外数据模态差异导致的鲁棒性下降问题。

Method: 提出WiSE-OD方法，包含两种变体：WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$和WiSE-OD$_{LP}$，通过集成RGB零样本和红外微调权重提升性能。

Result: WiSE-OD在不增加训练或推理成本的情况下，显著提升了跨模态和抗干扰鲁棒性。

Conclusion: WiSE-OD方法有效解决了红外目标检测中的模态差异问题，为实际应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and
nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces
models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR
improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts
due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we
introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)
benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,
to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained
models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:
WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and
WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across
three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both
cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or
inference cost.

Motivation: 现有预训练视觉模型在贴图情感理解上表现不足，因其依赖多视角信息（如背景知识和风格线索）。

Method: 利用多模态大语言模型生成多视角文本描述，设计分层融合策略，结合金字塔视觉变换器提取全局和局部特征，并通过对比学习和注意力机制注入文本特征。

Conclusion: MGHFT通过多视角文本引导和分层融合，有效提升了贴图情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding
remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as
background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view
sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,
inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple
views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by
providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a
hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual
understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both
global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive
learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different
stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and
local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce
a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall
multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on
2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly
outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher
accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best
pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%
on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管点云在几何数据结构中很重要，但从无序点云中提取有意义的结构信息并将其转换为语义分布仍是一个未充分探索的问题。

Method: PDT利用扩散模型，通过新颖的架构和学习策略，将原始几何分布转换为目标分布。

Result: 实验表明，PDT能成功将点云转换为多种结构化输出（如关键点、稀疏关节和连续特征线）。

Conclusion: PDT能够捕捉几何和语义特征，为3D几何处理任务提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in
geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods
typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the
underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural
information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into
semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.
We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with
diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the
point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution
that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with
novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the
source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input
point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from
surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.
The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and
semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing
tasks where structured point distributions are desired. Code will be available

Abstract: Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS)
technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as
a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods
demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion,
particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To
address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of
downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment
video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby
named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is
proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors
captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can
generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by
highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation
is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed
method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive
inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the
F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6

Abstract: Apical periodontitis is a prevalent oral pathology that presents significant
public health challenges. Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems
across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of
a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we
release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called "PerioXrays",
comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical
periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark
dataset for automated apical periodontitis diagnosis. This paper further
proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet)
paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and
IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by
background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive
experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet
in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection. Additionally, a
well-designed human-computer collaborative experiment underscores the clinical
applicability of our method as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for professional
dentists.

Abstract: Accurate identification of vehicle attributes such as make, colour, and shape
is critical for law enforcement and intelligence applications. This study
evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image
dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained
conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)
approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To
conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each
of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.
The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to
1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by
varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,
and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and
colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use
MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings
indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed
classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO
variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial
efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust
baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models
can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required
to search large vehicle images datasets.

Abstract: Underwater pollution is one of today's most significant environmental
concerns, with vast volumes of garbage found in seas, rivers, and landscapes
around the world. Accurate detection of these waste materials is crucial for
successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation
strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge
object recognition algorithms, namely YOLO (You Only Look Once) models,
including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional
Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at
recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly
trained and tested on a large dataset containing fifteen different classes
under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average
Precision (mAP) of 80.9%, indicating a significant performance. This increased
performance is attributed to YOLOv8's architecture, which incorporates advanced
features such as improved anchor-free mechanisms and self-supervised learning,
allowing for more precise and efficient recognition of items in a variety of
settings. These findings highlight the YOLOv8 model's potential as an effective

Result: 在八种顶级潜在扩散模型上的实验表明，AEDR比现有方法归因准确率提高25.5%，计算时间仅需1%。

Conclusion: AEDR为生成模型图像溯源提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible
for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising
significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of
such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a
promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high
computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address
these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel
training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous
autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the
value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive
reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these
two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further
calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which
inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with
autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.
Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%
higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while
requiring only 1% of the computational time.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过提示机制有效提升了点云分析的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in
various downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from
low-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common
issue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data
collected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point
cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,
due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,
these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the
conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the
ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above
challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates
point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust
analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a
Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted
rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving
intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we
further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts
based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and
adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently
unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point
cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete
point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
released at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-UPP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像超分辨率因低对比度和稀疏纹理而具有挑战性，需要长程建模以保持全局一致性。现有方法如Mamba的1D因果扫描机制会破坏2D图像的全局上下文。

Method: 提出GPSMamba框架，包括自适应语义-频率状态空间模块（ASF-SSM）和热谱注意力与相位一致性损失，以整合非局部上下文并强制全局结构保真。

Result: 实验表明GPSMamba在红外图像恢复任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GPSMamba为红外图像恢复提供了一种新的有效范式，解决了因果建模的局限性。

Abstract: Infrared Image Super-Resolution (IRSR) is challenged by the low contrast and
sparse textures of infrared data, requiring robust long-range modeling to
maintain global coherence. While State-Space Models like Mamba offer
proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent
1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images,
hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and
Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes
architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive
Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused
semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local
context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and
Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce
global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,
our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal
modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new
paradigm for infrared image restoration. Code is available at

Abstract: Contemporary image generation systems have achieved high fidelity and
superior aesthetic quality beyond basic text-image alignment. However, existing
evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals
that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP
architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to
images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant
discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we
design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that
achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the
degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this
foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely
the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while
maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing
methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art
text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support
for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic
preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/BarretBa/ICTHP.

and employs an automatic prompt strategy that aligns upstream physical
parameter pre-training with downstream expert annotation fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MedIQA significantly outperforms baselines in
multiple downstream tasks, establishing a scalable framework for medical IQA

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination,
producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or
established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of
hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text
(I2T) and Text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Specifically, we first propose
a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating
the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an
overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T
tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and
employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination
detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance
level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation.
Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection
methods, and outline potential directions for future research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的单次联邦学习框架，结合特征引导的修正流模型和双层知识蒸馏方法，显著提升了医疗影像场景下的训练效率和隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生成模型在单次联邦学习中训练效率低、隐私泄露风险高以及在非独立同分布数据下难以收敛的问题。

Method: 开发了特征引导的修正流模型（FG-RF）和双层知识蒸馏（DLKD）聚合方法，前者加速生成建模并保护隐私，后者处理非独立同分布数据。

Result: 在三个非独立同分布医疗影像数据集上，新框架性能优于多轮联邦学习方法，提升达21.73%，且隐私泄露风险显著降低。

Conclusion: 新框架在单次联邦学习中实现了高效训练和隐私保护，适用于医疗影像场景。

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索计算神经科学中多模态刺激下大脑活动的预测，并评估模型在新环境中的泛化能力。

Method: 使用X-CLIP（视觉）和Whisper（听觉）特征提取器构建编码模型，并在ID和OOD数据上进行评估。

Result: 高容量注意力模型在ID数据上表现优异，但线性模型在OOD数据上更稳健，提升18%。语言特征未提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 严格的OOD测试对构建稳健的神经AI模型至关重要，模型架构、刺激特性和感官层级共同影响多模态世界的神经编码。

Abstract: Predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli is
a key challenge in computational neuroscience. While encoding models are
becoming more powerful, their ability to generalize to truly novel contexts
remains a critical, often untested, question. In this work, we developed brain
encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper)
feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID)
and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental
trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity
attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more
robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\% on the OOD set.
Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive
accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be
dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual
information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the
auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech
representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD
testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced
insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory
hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.

Motivation: 混合模态搜索（跨图像、文本和多模态文档检索）是重要但未充分研究的应用，CLIP等模型在此任务中存在模态间隙问题。

Method: 提出GR-CLIP，一种轻量级后校准方法，消除CLIP嵌入空间中的模态间隙。

Result: 在MixBench基准上，GR-CLIP比CLIP提升NDCG@10达26个百分点，优于其他模型且计算量减少75倍。

Conclusion: GR-CLIP有效解决了模态间隙问题，显著提升了混合模态搜索性能。

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖外推模块生成连续视图，但会因累积偏差导致语义漂移，影响生成质量。

Method: 引入SceneConceptGraph层次化图结构，动态构建多级场景概念关系，指导外推模块生成一致且多样的新视图。

Result: 实验表明，ScenePainter能有效克服语义漂移问题，生成更一致和沉浸的3D视图序列。

Conclusion: ScenePainter通过场景概念图提升了3D场景生成的语义一致性和多样性。

Abstract: Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view
sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and
rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view
sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated
deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,
which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of
the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure
dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene
concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be
dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more
consistent and immersive 3D view sequences. Project Page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的噪声鲁棒查询优化（NRQO）范式，结合噪声容忍特征金字塔网络（NT-FPN）和成对相似性区域提议网络（PS-RPN），以解决小目标检测中的噪声敏感性和查询质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based检测器在小目标检测中仍面临特征金字塔网络的噪声敏感性和标签分配策略中查询质量下降的问题。

Method: NRQO结合NT-FPN（通过保留空间和语义信息完整性减少噪声）和PS-RPN（通过位置和形状相似性增强锚点-真实匹配，生成高质量查询）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，NRQO优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: NRQO通过创新的噪声容忍和查询优化策略，显著提升了小目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Transformer-based detectors for small object
detection (SOD), recent studies show that these detectors still face challenges
due to inherent noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks (FPN) and
diminished query quality in existing label assignment strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm,
which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network
(NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN).
Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving
spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment
strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive
queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape
similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of
NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）中较少被探讨的否定理解问题，提出了一种低资源消耗的否定感知测试时适应方法（NEAT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中需要模型识别虚假或不存在的内容（如医学图像排除特定条件），但现有VLMs在否定理解上表现不佳，且数据驱动的解决方案资源消耗大。

Method: 提出NEAT方法，通过调整推理过程中与分布相关的参数，减少肯定与否定分布间的概念偏移。

Result: 在多种否定理解任务上的实验验证了NEAT的有效性。

Conclusion: NEAT提供了一种低资源消耗的解决方案，显著提升了VLMs的否定理解能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many
real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or
non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific
conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale
training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.
To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the
scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive
data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions
demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable
widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically
observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the
affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware
Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related
parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in
consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in
unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation
understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code
is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/NEAT.

Conclusion: 框架有效提升了解码的准确性和重建质量，适用于多被试场景。

Abstract: Decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals has advanced with pre-trained
generative models. However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject
mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This
challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate
partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models,
accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we
propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate
decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects
through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping
to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To
further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we
introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and
a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual
representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits
strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.

Result: 在三个医学异常检测基准测试中表现最优，验证了其高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SP-Mamba为医学异常检测提供了高效且稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiography imaging protocols target on specific anatomical regions,
resulting in highly consistent images with recurrent structural patterns across
patients. Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the
effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit
limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer
from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models,
leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and
linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To
capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study
introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised
medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and
Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit
consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical
anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast
characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive
experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the
proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and
robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/Ray-RuiPan/SP-Mamba.

Motivation: 多任务学习在密集预测中表现良好，但共享表示与任务特定专业化之间的平衡仍具挑战性。

Method: 1. 提出任务内专家，沿MLP的中间隐藏维度划分；2. 引入共享专家，整合任务内不同上下文的共同信息；3. 设计全局专家，促进任务间自适应知识转移。此外，采用微调方法仅训练解码器参数以提高效率。

Result: 在NYUD-v2和PASCAL-Context数据集上，FGMoE使用更少参数，性能显著优于当前基于MoE的竞争模型。

Conclusion: FGMoE通过细粒度专家设计和微调方法，有效平衡了共享与专业化，提升了密集预测任务的性能。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) for dense prediction has shown promising results
but still faces challenges in balancing shared representations with
task-specific specialization. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fine-Grained
Mixture of Experts (FGMoE) architecture that explores MoE-based MTL models
through a combination of three key innovations and fine-tuning. First, we
propose intra-task experts that partition along intermediate hidden dimensions
of MLPs, enabling finer decomposition of task information while maintaining
parameter efficiency. Second, we introduce shared experts that consolidate
common information across different contexts of the same task, reducing
redundancy, and allowing routing experts to focus on unique aspects. Third, we
design a global expert that facilitates adaptive knowledge transfer across
tasks based on both input feature and task requirements, promoting beneficial
information sharing while preventing harmful interference. In addition, we use
the fine-tuning approach to improve parameter efficiency only by training the
parameters of the decoder. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed FGMoE uses fewer parameters and significantly outperforms current
MoE-based competitive MTL models on two dense prediction datasets
(\textit{i.e.,} NYUD-v2, PASCAL-Context) in various metrics.

Abstract: Reliable medical image classification requires accurate predictions and
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially in high-stakes clinical
settings. This work presents MedSymmFlow, a generative-discriminative hybrid
model built on Symmetrical Flow Matching, designed to unify classification,

leverages a latent-space formulation that scales to high-resolution inputs and
introduces a semantic mask conditioning mechanism to enhance diagnostic
relevance. Unlike standard discriminative models, it naturally estimates
uncertainty through its generative sampling process. The model is evaluated on
four MedMNIST datasets, covering a range of modalities and pathologies. The
results show that MedSymmFlow matches or exceeds the performance of established
baselines in classification accuracy and AUC, while also delivering reliable
uncertainty estimates validated by performance improvements under selective

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但容易产生对象幻觉，即描述图像中不存在的对象。

Result: 实验表明，LISA在CHAIR_I基准上减少幻觉达53.6%，POPE F1提升4.5%。

Conclusion: LISA是一种即插即用的方法，能有效减少对象幻觉并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such
as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they
describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose
\textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and
\textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency
through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the
functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual
grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify
spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention
by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving
alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected
layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and
soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully
\textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs,
including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces
hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by
4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

Result: 在HRSC2016和DOTA数据集上，CSTF分别达到90.99%和90.86%的平均mAP，推理速度为12.5 FPS。

Conclusion: CSTF显著提升了跨模态特征匹配效果，并直接增强了遥感应用（如目标检测）的性能。

Abstract: Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching
remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric
differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract
features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal
similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)
mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant
keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our
approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating
correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions
simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as
a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive
local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in
robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the
practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object
detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method
achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016
and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains
computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results
validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances
downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.

Motivation: 现有基于点和网格的方法在建模人类运动动态时存在局限性，无法平衡局部运动细节与长程时空依赖，且时间表示缺乏与频域的交互。

Result: 在ETH-UCY、SDD、NBA和JRDB数据集上实现了最先进的性能和高效率。

Conclusion: PatchTraj通过统一时域和频域表示，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key
limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to
balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and
the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling
trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a
dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain
and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory
into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch
partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical
motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with
scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to
model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two
branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of
temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates
both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive
experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性上均优于现有采样和恢复方法。

Conclusion: TopGeoFormer通过结合拓扑和几何特征，显著提升了点云恢复的性能。

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and
restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both
topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical
features throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit
traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using
a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and
integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space.
Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge
topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness
in both phases to form a learnable shape context facilitated with point-wise,
point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry
loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both
Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching
between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better
geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for
better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we
comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and
learning-based sampling/upsampling algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling
and recovery methods.

*Weitian Wang,Rai Shubham,Cecilia De La Parra,Akash Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixA-Q是一种混合精度激活量化框架，利用窗口视觉变换器中的激活稀疏性，提升量化模型的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过利用激活稀疏性，优化量化窗口视觉变换器的推理效率，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 提出Two-Branch Swin Block，将激活分为高精度和低精度分支处理，兼容QAT和PTQ方法。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，MixA-Q在PTQ配置下实现1.35倍计算加速且无精度损失；QAT下实现1.25倍加速（无损失）或1.53倍加速（仅1% mAP下降）。

Conclusion: MixA-Q通过稀疏感知量化适应，显著减少量化误差，提升低精度模型的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization
framework that leverages intra-layer activation sparsity (a concept widely
explored in activation pruning methods) for efficient inference of quantized
window-based vision transformers. For a given uniform-bit quantization
configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin
blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important
windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We
introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in
high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with
most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the
COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x
computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,
MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP
drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization
error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves
the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit
precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种原型-亲和力混合网络（PAHNet），通过平衡原型学习和亲和力学习两种方法的保守与激进特性，提升了少样本分割任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现原型学习方法预测保守，而亲和力学习方法预测激进，因此希望通过结合两者优势提升分割性能。

Method: PAHNet引入了原型引导特征增强（PFE）模块和注意力分数校准（ASC）模块，利用预训练原型预测器的输出优化亲和力学习模型。

Result: 实验表明，PAHNet在PASCAL-5$^i$和COCO-20$^i$数据集上的1-shot和5-shot设置中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAHNet通过平衡保守与激进信息，显著提高了少样本分割的准确性。

Abstract: This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to
segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a
model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two
mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype
learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning
methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance
the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS
frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we
propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which
introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention
Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning
model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions
generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype
predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image
representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)
relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of
the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually
increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results
show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and
5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its
effectiveness. The code is available at: [GitHub - tianyu-zou/PAHNet: Balancing

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIDE是一种新型方法，通过稀疏训练和剪枝方案提高原型部分的解释性，显著减少解释规模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在高风险领域缺乏透明度，现有原型方法要么局限于细粒度任务，要么解释复杂。

Method: SIDE采用稀疏训练和剪枝方案，结合sigmoid激活函数，使每个类仅关联少量原型。

Result: SIDE在保持准确性的同时，将解释规模减少90%以上。

Conclusion: SIDE显著提升了原型解释的可理解性。

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.

*Jie Chen,Zhangchi Hu,Peixi Wu,Huyue Zhu,Hebei Li,Xiaoyan Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DASH是一个实时动态场景渲染框架，通过4D哈希编码和自监督分解解决动态高斯泼溅中的特征重叠和渲染质量问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态高斯泼溅方法因低秩假设导致特征重叠和渲染质量差，4D哈希编码虽无低秩约束但直接应用会导致哈希冲突和冗余。

Method: 采用自监督分解分离动态和静态成分，引入多分辨率4D哈希编码动态元素，并使用时空调平滑正则化策略。

Result: 在真实数据集上实现264 FPS的实时渲染，视觉质量显著提升。

Conclusion: DASH通过创新方法解决了动态场景渲染的挑战，实现了高性能和高质量渲染。

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing
plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable
low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.
Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank
constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to
substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we
present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D
hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins
with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and
static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we
introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an
explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we
present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate
unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting
enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

*Yuki Igaue,Hiroaki Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多头自注意力权重的方差评估补丁重要性的剪枝策略，提高计算效率同时保持分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头自注意力在视觉Transformer中计算复杂度高，补丁剪枝是解决这一问题的有效方法。

Method: 通过评估多头自注意力权重的方差（或中位数绝对偏差）确定补丁重要性，并结合重叠补丁嵌入提升性能。

Result: 在保持分类精度的同时提高了计算吞吐量，重叠补丁嵌入进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡，适用于预训练模型的微调场景。

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of
vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input
patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is
known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number
of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,
which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant
patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the
importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across
multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head
self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across
different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be
easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved
throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as
fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using
robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of
variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.
Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves
better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that
utilize all patches.

TL;DR: LOTUS是一个评估详细图像描述的新基准，填补了现有评估的标准化、偏见意识和用户偏好三大空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述评估缺乏标准化、偏见意识和用户偏好考量，LOTUS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LOTUS通过多维度评估（如描述质量、风险、社会偏见）和用户偏好定制，全面分析大型视觉语言模型。

Result: 分析显示，没有单一模型在所有标准上表现优异，且描述细节与偏见风险相关。用户偏好影响最佳模型选择。

Conclusion: LOTUS为详细图像描述评估提供了全面框架，强调用户偏好在模型选择中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning,
shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a
leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in
existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments,
and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various
aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user
preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across
all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.
Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection
depends on user priorities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于持续学习的统一图像修复框架，适用于多种天气条件下的图像修复，通过选择性核融合层、弹性权重巩固和循环对比损失实现高效修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多针对单一天气条件修复，而自动驾驶等应用需要统一模型处理多种天气条件下的图像退化问题。

Method: 提出选择性核融合层动态结合全局和局部特征，弹性权重巩固防止任务间遗忘，循环对比损失增强特征区分度。

Result: 在去雾、去雪和去雨任务中，PSNR、SSIM和感知质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为多天气条件下的图像修复提供了一种高效且统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Restoration of images contaminated by different adverse weather conditions
such as fog, snow, and rain is a challenging task due to the varying nature of
the weather conditions. Most of the existing methods focus on any one
particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous
driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted
images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning
approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed
framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers
that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature
selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3)
a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while
preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose
an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed
approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant
improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 当前对LVLMs中时空理解的内在推理机制研究不足，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了三种电路（视觉审计电路、语义追踪电路和注意力流电路）来系统分析LVLMs中的时空语义处理。

Result: 发现视觉语义集中于特定对象标记（移除后性能下降92.6%），且对象和动作的可解释概念在中后期层逐步细化。

Conclusion: 研究为LVLMs的时空语义分析提供了机制性见解，为设计更鲁棒和可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在单目语义场景补全中存在特征纠缠和几何不一致的问题，VisHall3D旨在通过两阶段设计解决这些问题。

Method: VisHall3D分为两阶段：1) 使用VisFrontierNet重建可见区域；2) 使用OcclusionMAE推断不可见区域。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和SSCBench-KITTI-360基准测试中，VisHall3D表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VisHall3D通过两阶段设计有效提升了场景补全的准确性和可靠性，为自动驾驶等应用提供了更好的场景理解。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular
semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature
entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.
VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing
the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions
(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware
projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while
preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a
hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the
invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene
completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates
feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly
improved reconstruction quality.
  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on
two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a
significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene
understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出CounterNet，一种基于热图的网络，用于提高大规模点云数据中物体计数的准确性，从而优化查询结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆生成大量点云数据，但只有部分数据对特定任务（如碰撞检测、交通分析）相关。现有方法在3D点云数据中计数不准确，导致查询结果错误。

Method: 提出CounterNet，通过检测物体中心而非精确定位来提高计数准确性，并采用特征图分区策略和动态模型选择策略。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CounterNet将计数准确性提高了5%至20%，显著改善了查询结果的可靠性。

Conclusion: CounterNet通过改进计数准确性，为点云数据查询提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a
subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic
analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential
to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying
by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each
aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on
accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object
counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on
indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide
accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,
state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object
counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this
limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for
accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing
on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding
object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance
with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling
better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To
adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model
selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each
input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that
CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,
resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

Result: 在SPA-ADV和其他基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SPA-ADV和PRE-MAP为个性化视觉注意力研究提供了新工具，解决了现有模型的局限性。

Abstract: Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human
prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms
with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation
and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models
and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive
diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,
typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to
generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which
limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.
Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it
very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving
multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is
challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized
Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal
dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age
and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel
eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities
through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and
guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs
produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,
we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired
by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.
Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成多人类上下文运动需要对动态关系进行整体推理，现有方法难以处理大规模和多样性。

Result: 框架在基准测试和用户研究中表现出高效捕捉场景上下文的能力，具有高扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架首次在大规模和多样性上解决了多人类动态场景生成问题，并提供了评估基准。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework that creates a lively virtual dynamic
scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human
contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among
human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large
language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input
and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate
multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.
Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a
dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a
well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we
synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial
guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive
context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the
retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale
and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of
contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our
framework effectively captures scene context with high scalability. The code
and benchmark, along with result videos, are available at our project page:

Conclusion: CoopTrack通过实例级特征传输和高效关联机制，显著提升了协同感知能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of
single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among
multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame
perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential
perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully
instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring
learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing
approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that
significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low
transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:
Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and
Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation
with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and
fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin
datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.
Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP

Result: 在MVTec-3D AD和Eyecandies数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效桥接2D和3D异常检测，无需复杂融合即可利用多模态特征。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention
and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying
3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite
explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud
backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to
adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the
disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the
scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal
scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world
abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly
detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key
aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data
simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth
and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the
flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly
Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies
in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,
effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can
directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.
Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD
and Eyecandies datasets. Code available at:

Result: 在OV-Fact过滤的数据集上训练的模型，显著提升了事实性精度，同时保持了描述的丰富性。

Conclusion: OV-Fact为长描述的事实性评估提供了新工具，并支持基于事实性的数据过滤应用。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and
factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and
factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and
in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We
introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long
captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based
verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves
agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness
(recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous
metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards
factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an
OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated)
pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing
caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.

*Sijie Li,Chen Chen,Jungong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimMLM是一个简单而强大的多模态学习框架，专注于处理缺失模态问题，通过动态混合模态专家架构和MoFe排名损失提升准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂架构或数据填补技术，SimMLM旨在提供通用且高效的解决方案，适应不同缺失模态场景。

Method: 采用动态混合模态专家（DMoME）架构和MoFe排名损失，动态调整模态贡献并确保任务准确性随模态增加而提升。

Result: 在BraTS 2018、UPMC Food-101和avMNIST任务中表现优于现有方法，展示了高准确性、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SimMLM为多模态学习提供了一种高效、通用的解决方案，适用于完整和缺失模态场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for
multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that
rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation
techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to
various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.
Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts
(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that
automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial
modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer
(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains
stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an
intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase
accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS
2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it
consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,
interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing
modality scenarios at test time.

Abstract: Self-supervised image encoders such as DINO have recently gained significant
interest for learning robust visual features without labels. However, most SSL
methods train on static images and miss the temporal cues inherent in videos.
We introduce a video-distilled single-image encoder trained to predict the
next-frame representation from the current frame. This simple objective injects
3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking. When
pre-training on a single 2-hour video, our approach raises the mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4 while
remaining a drop-in replacement for image-only pipelines. Our results highlight
video self-distillation as a lightweight route to geometry-aware perception an
essential ingredient for physically plausible world models and Physical AI.

Conclusion: RemoteReasoner为遥感推理提供了灵活且强大的解决方案，超越了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,
demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and
contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim
to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by
reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it
should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do
not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be
unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks
with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote
sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on
supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To
this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote
sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal
large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing
targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity
output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained
with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for
precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable
diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific
decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity
reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our
framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond
the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

Abstract: Generating realistic group interactions involving multiple characters remains
challenging due to increasing complexity as group size expands. While existing
conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on
previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting
nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,
we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,
training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable
interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group
interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages
pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose
group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts
such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs
physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise
user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships
without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO
generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person
interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.

Conclusion: ABCD方法高效且适用于实时应用，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Detection of blood cells in microscopic images has become a major focus of
medical image analysis, playing a crucial role in gaining valuable insights
into a patient's health. Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are
known to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these
limitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors
can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic
blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an
object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to
enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the
Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which
optimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the
network. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the
Intersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over
Union (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.
Compared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5
and 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and
increased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time
applications.

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中取得了新的最优或竞争性结果，同时保持了高效性。

Conclusion: MuStD网络通过多模态特征融合显著提升了3D物体检测性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Fusion of LiDAR and RGB data has the potential to enhance outdoor 3D object
detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object
detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,
effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task
still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream
Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information
from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its
LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input
while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An
additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV
mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing
comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused
and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation

Abstract: Creating a virtual avatar with semantically coherent gestures that are
aligned with speech is a challenging task. Existing gesture generation research
mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic
context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic
information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with
learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder.
Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate
gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures
consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and
co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and
coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks
in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics. The
qualitative results of our model, code, dataset and pre-trained models can be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViTs在计算机视觉中表现优异，但为适应不同资源约束需多次训练，耗时耗能。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 增强预训练ViT的弹性架构；2) 设计轻量级路由器选择子模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了EA-ViT的有效性和多功能性。

Conclusion: EA-ViT提供了一种高效且灵活的ViT部署方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer
vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks.
However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically
requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming
and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT
adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate
multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various
resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables
structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,
embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and
ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that
progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a
lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and
downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived
via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with
the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has the potential to transform transportation,
but its wide adoption depends on the development of interpretable and
transparent decision-making systems. Scene captioning, which generates natural
language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in
enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM,
a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM
leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,
incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene
descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves
competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art
by up to 5\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView
(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on
object grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving
scenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial
benchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光片在疾病诊断中至关重要，但临床数据的长尾分布导致自监督深度学习模型对罕见类别的分类效果不佳。

Method: 采用类加权机制，结合GMM聚类和Student t分布优化潜在空间分布，并使用度量损失调整嵌入。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR-JPG数据集的40个类别中，零样本AUC得分平均提升7%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了罕见类别的识别准确性，为长尾分布问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various
diseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical
findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep
learning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed
classes. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image
Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the
latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP
performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals
that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed
distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly
aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method
ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with
particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely
observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by
Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered
embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the
features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in
zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from
previous SOTA models.

Motivation: 解决现有长上下文处理技术在单设备上计算和内存开销高的问题，同时克服模态特定方法的局限性。

Method: MAELRE结合token合并和注意力近似，逐步合并token并在不同阶段切换注意力机制。

Result: 在文本、时间序列、音频和视觉等多模态分类任务中，MAELRE在降低计算成本的同时实现了更高的精度。

Conclusion: MAELRE为长上下文处理提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于多种模态。

Abstract: The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be
surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as
hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to
scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic
computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this
paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device
using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and
inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic
single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions
-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE
(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient
transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse
modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,
progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational
blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of
tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence
becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE
achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to
existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple
modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.

Result: 在合成和真实失真数据集上的实验验证了DEFNet的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DEFNet具有强泛化能力和对未知场景的适应性。

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary
tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due
to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation,
leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which
performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion
type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable
representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It
first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance
information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by
balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet
exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential
learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation
and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability
and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖LiDAR标注和网格表示，限制了可扩展性和利用众包数据的能力。GS-Occ3D旨在通过纯视觉方法解决这些问题。

Method: 采用Octree高斯曲面优化显式占用表示，并将场景分解为静态背景、地面和动态物体，分别建模以提高一致性。

Conclusion: GS-Occ3D展示了大规模视觉占用重建作为自动驾驶感知新范式的潜力。

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric
priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and
prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for
auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only
framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy
reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic
scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing
vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from
incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To
overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation
using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and
scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,
and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is
explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly
improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled
to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on
the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry
reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from
diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy
models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.
It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy
reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project

Conclusion: DINO-SLAM通过EDINO特征显著提升了SLAM系统的性能。

Abstract: This paper presents DINO-SLAM, a DINO-informed design strategy to enhance
neural implicit (Neural Radiance Field -- NeRF) and explicit representations
(3D Gaussian Splatting -- 3DGS) in SLAM systems through more comprehensive
scene representations. Purposely, we rely on a Scene Structure Encoder (SSE)
that enriches DINO features into Enhanced DINO ones (EDINO) to capture
hierarchical scene elements and their structural relationships. Building upon
it, we propose two foundational paradigms for NeRF and 3DGS SLAM systems
integrating EDINO features. Our DINO-informed pipelines achieve superior
performance on the Replica, ScanNet, and TUM compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 评估GUI自动化代理在不同平台上的表现，并解决任务效率不足的问题。

Method: 提出MMBench-GUI基准和EQA指标，涵盖GUI内容理解、元素定位、任务自动化和协作四个层级。

Result: 发现视觉定位对任务成功至关重要，任务效率普遍不足，冗余步骤多。

Conclusion: 强调精准定位、任务规划和效率策略的整合对高效GUI自动化的必要性。

Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI
automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element
Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills
for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)
metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.
Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical
determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of
modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,
to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and
cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad
action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,
task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models
suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even
when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,
effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable
truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation
data, and running environment will be publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种具有明确头发组合性的3D头部虚拟形象通用先验模型，解决了现有方法难以分离脸部和头发表示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将脸部和头发视为不可分割的整体，忽略了其组合性，导致难以灵活支持3D脸部和发型交换等应用。

Method: 通过合成无头发数据集，分别学习脸部和头发的潜在空间，并利用组合性作为归纳偏置实现有效分离。

Result: 模型能够无缝转移脸部和头发组件，同时保留身份特征，并支持少样本微调生成高保真3D头部虚拟形象。

Conclusion: 该方法为灵活且富有表现力的3D虚拟形象生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair
compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head
avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as
an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the
human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and
hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such
holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle
swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we
introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of
face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this
approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair
from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture
derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and
hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,
incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective
separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of
face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot
manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D
head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical
applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for
flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.

Abstract: Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of death among children

In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual

Activation Mapping (BayesGrad-CAM), which quantifies uncertainty in visual

decision-making process of the model. Our ResNet-50 model, trained on a large
paediatric chest X-rays dataset, achieves high classification accuracy
(95.94%), AUC-ROC (98.91%), and Cohen's Kappa (0.913), accompanied by
clinically meaningful visual explanations. Our findings demonstrate that high
performance and interpretability are not only achievable but critical for
clinical AI deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单像素成像中，图像重建速度和质量受限于测量向量和重建方法，因此需要一种更高效的方法来优化压缩、重建质量和速度。

Method: 通过自监督训练一个自动编码器，学习编码器（测量矩阵）和解码器，并在实际获取的多光谱和强度数据上进行测试。

Result: 该方法将重建时间缩短了两个数量级，实现了更优的图像质量，并支持多光谱重建。

Conclusion: 学习型单像素荧光显微镜技术有望推动诊断和生物学研究，以低成本实现多光谱成像。

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence
microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this
context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In
practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image
from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling
pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to
learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing
compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through
self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We
then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During
acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our
approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by
reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior
image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned
single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological
research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了潜在扩散模型生成图像过于平滑的问题，提升了脑部MRI图像的真实性和细节表现。

Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.

Motivation: 手动标注针在患者图像上耗时且困难，现有后处理技术对分割错误不够鲁棒。

Method: 采用两阶段流程（分割+后处理），改进现有后处理技术以应对分割错误。

Conclusion: 改进的后处理技术能有效管理分割错误，提高重建精度。

Abstract: Brachytherapy involves bringing a radioactive source near tumor tissue using
implanted needles. Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others,
the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient
images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals.
For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted,
comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep
learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain
errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all
possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing
post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and
thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer
dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate
that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation
errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median
needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\pm
1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error
of $0.75$ (IQR $\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative
needles on a test set of 261 needles.

Motivation: 医学图像中的噪声会影响诊断和治疗效果，现有方法通常仅针对单一模态或噪声类型，缺乏通用性。

Method: 采用双路径学习（DPL）架构，同时利用噪声特征和图像上下文信息进行去噪。

Result: DPL在多种模态和噪声类型下表现稳健，PSNR比基线UNet提高3.35%。

Conclusion: DPL是一种通用且高效的医学图像去噪方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling
clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment
plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image
quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.
Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or
on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed
and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng
et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a
Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises
medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to
generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities
and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on
Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at

Abstract: Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of
the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography
(CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using
a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is
proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of
pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the
in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the
semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of
labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher
model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which
reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the
student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is
iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:
Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD
patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed
method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by
2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is
conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the
differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.
Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of
pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The

Abstract: Context modeling is essential in learned image compression for accurately
estimating the distribution of latents. While recent advanced methods have
expanded context modeling capacity, they still struggle to efficiently exploit
long-range dependency and diverse context information across different coding
steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Progressive Context
Model (HPCM) for more efficient context information acquisition. Specifically,
HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model the
contextual dependencies among latents at multiple scales, which enables more
efficient long-range context modeling. Furthermore, we propose a progressive
context fusion mechanism that incorporates contextual information from previous
coding steps into the current step, effectively exploiting diverse contextual
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and strikes a better balance
between compression performance and computational complexity. The code is

Abstract: In medical imaging, generative models are increasingly relied upon for two
distinct but equally critical tasks: reconstruction, where the goal is to
restore medical imaging (usually inverse problems like inpainting or
superresolution), and generation, where synthetic data is created to augment
datasets or carry out counterfactual analysis. Despite shared architecture and
learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high
perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity
and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and
systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive
models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of
generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing
on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as
well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models
offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to
hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain
stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally
lower fidelity.

Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer
screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support
large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods
is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in
lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for
data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize
lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel
framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and
localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,
where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that
represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical
coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize
lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that
guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most
relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing
their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise
control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of
synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool
for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at

Method: 使用公开临床数据集评估ULS23模型的分割和跟踪能力，并通过人为位移实验验证模型对中心假设的依赖性。

Conclusion: 需开发端到端模型，专门设计用于时间序列分析，以提升纵向病变跟踪的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Longitudinal lesion analysis is crucial for oncological care, yet automated
tools often struggle with temporal consistency. While universal lesion
segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time
points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model
in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and
follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track
lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a
sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan
registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence
process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled
experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the
true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is
highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy
collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal
data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift
away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models
inherently designed for temporal analysis.

Conclusion: NerT-CA为稀疏视角冠状动脉造影的4D重建提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary
arteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve
clinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,
most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel
distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art
reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone
automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches
based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic
reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long
training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose
NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for
accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the
previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank
and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static
reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our
approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction
accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram
views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on
representative 4D phantom datasets.

Method: 设计了优化的向量量化空间，采用非对称编码器-解码器架构（Audio-VQ-Mel-Audio），结合双监督和渐进训练。

Result: 在0.3kbps带宽下实现语音重建的SOTA性能，验证了模块的必要性。

Conclusion: HH-Codec在压缩效率和重建质量上表现优异，适用于生成模型适配。

Abstract: Discrete speech tokenization is a fundamental component in speech codecs.
However, in large-scale speech-to-speech systems, the complexity of parallel
streams from multiple quantizers and the computational cost of
high-time-dimensional codecs pose significant challenges. In this paper, we
introduce HH-Codec, a neural codec that achieves extreme compression at 24
tokens per second for 24 kHz audio while relying on single-quantizer inference.
Our approach involves a carefully designed Vector Quantization space for Spoken
Language Modeling, optimizing compression efficiency while minimizing
information loss. Building on this, we propose an asymmetric encoder-decoder
architecture (Audio-VQ-Mel-Audio) that leverages dual supervision and
progressive training to enhance reconstruction stability and fidelity. HH-Codec
achieves state-of-the-art performance in speech reconstruction with an
ultra-low bandwidth of 0.3 kbps. We further evaluate its effectiveness in
codebook utilization and generative model adaptation, with extensive ablations
validating the necessity of each module. HH-Codec is available at

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在噪声环境下提升自动语音识别（ASR）准确性的条件和架构研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态输入在噪声环境中如何提升ASR准确性，以弥补单一模态的不足。

Method: 通过合成和真实数据实验，分析不同模态（如语音、文本、图像）对ASR的影响，并研究同步与非同步模态的作用。

Result: 多模态通常能提升ASR准确性，但效果依赖噪声水平；同步模态在高噪声下更有效，非同步模态在中等噪声下更优；视觉表示质量对准确性至关重要。

Conclusion: 多模态输入的顺序和损失函数权重显著影响ASR准确性，为噪声环境下的多模态语音识别提供了实践和理论指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
possibilities for unified modeling of speech, text, images, and other
modalities. Building on our prior work, this paper examines the conditions and
model architectures under which multiple input modalities can improve automatic
speech recognition (ASR) accuracy in noisy environments. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world data, we find that (1) harnessing more modalities
usually improves ASR accuracy, as each modality provides complementary
information, but the improvement depends on the amount of auditory noise. (2)
Synchronized modalities (e.g., lip movements) are more useful at high noise
levels whereas unsynchronized modalities (e.g., image context) are most helpful
at moderate noise levels. (3) Higher-quality visual representations
consistently improve ASR accuracy, highlighting the importance of developing
more powerful visual encoders. (4) Mamba exhibits similar trends regarding the
benefits of multimodality as do Transformers. (5) The input order of modalities
as well as their weights in the loss function can significantly impact
accuracy. These findings both offer practical insights and help to deepen our
understanding of multi-modal speech recognition under challenging conditions.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: OmniGSE是一种新型通用语音增强框架，通过两阶段架构结合判别式和生成式方法，有效处理多种语音失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常仅针对单一失真优化，难以应对复杂场景中多种失真同时存在的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：第一阶段使用NAC-RoFormer增强连续特征；第二阶段通过分层语言模型（RootLM和BranchLMs）生成离散令牌重构高质量语音。

Result: 实验表明，OmniGSE在多个基准测试中优于现有模型，尤其在复合失真场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: OmniGSE展示了在现实应用中实现稳健且多功能语音增强的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniGSE, a novel general speech enhancement (GSE)
framework designed to mitigate the diverse distortions that speech signals
encounter in real-world scenarios. These distortions include background noise,
reverberation, bandwidth limitations, signal clipping, and network packet loss.
Existing methods typically focus on optimizing for a single type of distortion,
often struggling to effectively handle the simultaneous presence of multiple
distortions in complex scenarios. OmniGSE bridges this gap by integrating the
strengths of discriminative and generative approaches through a two-stage
architecture that enables cross-domain collaborative optimization. In the first
stage, continuous features are enhanced using a lightweight channel-split
NAC-RoFormer. In the second stage, discrete tokens are generated to reconstruct
high-quality speech through language models. Specifically, we designed a
hierarchical language model structure consisting of a RootLM and multiple
BranchLMs. The RootLM models general acoustic features across codebook layers,
while the BranchLMs explicitly capture the progressive relationships between
different codebook levels. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniGSE
surpasses existing models across multiple benchmarks, particularly excelling in
scenarios involving compound distortions. These findings underscore the
framework's potential for robust and versatile speech enhancement in real-world
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统拼接合成中的不连续性问题，同时保留目标音频的时间结构和源音频的音色特征。

Method: 通过编码源音频语料库创建“颗粒码本”，匹配目标音频的潜在颗粒到码本中最接近的对应部分，解码生成混合音频。

Result: 生成的音频保留了目标的时间结构，同时具备源音频的音色特征，避免了传统方法的不连续性。

Conclusion: 该技术提供了一种高效且灵活的音频重合成方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce a novel technique for creative audio resynthesis that operates
by reworking the concept of granular synthesis at the latent vector level. Our
approach creates a "granular codebook" by encoding a source audio corpus into
latent vector segments, then matches each latent grain of a target audio signal
to its closest counterpart in the codebook. The resulting hybrid sequence is
decoded to produce audio that preserves the target's temporal structure while
adopting the source's timbral characteristics. This technique requires no model
training, works with diverse audio materials, and naturally avoids the
discontinuities typical of traditional concatenative synthesis through the
codec's implicit interpolation during decoding. We include supplementary
material at https://github.com/naotokui/latentgranular/ , as well as a
proof-of-concept implementation to allow users to experiment with their own
sounds at https://huggingface.co/spaces/naotokui/latentgranular .

Method: 提出Face2VoiceSync框架，包括语音-面部对齐、多样性控制、高效训练（轻量VAE桥接视觉与音频预训练模型）和新评估指标。

Result: 实验显示Face2VoiceSync在单40GB GPU上实现视觉和音频的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Face2VoiceSync成功解决了语音和面部生成的同步问题，并提供了多样性和高效性。

Abstract: Recent studies in speech-driven talking face generation achieve promising
results, but their reliance on fixed-driven speech limits further applications
(e.g., face-voice mismatch). Thus, we extend the task to a more challenging
setting: given a face image and text to speak, generating both talking face
animation and its corresponding speeches. Accordingly, we propose a novel
framework, Face2VoiceSync, with several novel contributions: 1) Voice-Face
Alignment, ensuring generated voices match facial appearance; 2) Diversity \&
Manipulation, enabling generated voice control over paralinguistic features
space; 3) Efficient Training, using a lightweight VAE to bridge visual and
audio large-pretrained models, with significantly fewer trainable parameters
than existing methods; 4) New Evaluation Metric, fairly assessing the diversity
and identity consistency. Experiments show Face2VoiceSync achieves both visual
and audio state-of-the-art performances on a single 40GB GPU.

Method: 提出LIGHT框架，结合个体动作分布和人类专家偏好分布，设计基于Q学习的个体内在奖励。

Result: 实验证明LIGHT在性能和知识复用性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LIGHT有效整合人类知识，提升MARL在复杂任务中的学习和泛化能力。

Abstract: Efficient exploration in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a
challenging problem when receiving only a team reward, especially in
environments with sparse rewards. A powerful method to mitigate this issue
involves crafting dense individual rewards to guide the agents toward efficient
exploration. However, individual rewards generally rely on manually engineered
shaping-reward functions that lack high-order intelligence, thus it behaves
ineffectively than humans regarding learning and generalization in complex
problems. To tackle these issues, we combine the above two paradigms and
propose a novel framework, LIGHT (Learning Individual Intrinsic reward via
Incorporating Generalized Human experTise), which can integrate human knowledge
into MARL algorithms in an end-to-end manner. LIGHT guides each agent to avoid
unnecessary exploration by considering both individual action distribution and
human expertise preference distribution. Then, LIGHT designs individual
intrinsic rewards for each agent based on actionable representational
transformation relevant to Q-learning so that the agents align their action
preferences with the human expertise while maximizing the joint action value.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over
representative baselines regarding performance and better knowledge reusability
across different sparse-reward tasks on challenging scenarios.

Method: 采用分段引导方案，根据扩散时间步定义引导项，适应高噪声和低噪声阶段的不同需求。

Result: 在图像修复任务中，推理时间显著减少（25%至24%），PSNR和SSIM损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 该框架通用性强，计算高效，适用于多种逆问题，且能显式处理测量噪声。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

Result: 实验表明DGAKT性能优于现有模型，且显著提升了资源效率。

Conclusion: DGAKT为知识追踪领域提供了高效且性能优越的新方法。

Abstract: The rise of online learning has led to the development of various knowledge
tracing (KT) methods. However, existing methods have overlooked the problem of
increasing computational cost when utilizing large graphs and long learning
sequences. To address this issue, we introduce Dual Graph Attention-based
Knowledge Tracing (DGAKT), a graph neural network model designed to leverage
high-order information from subgraphs representing student-exercise-KC
relationships. DGAKT incorporates a subgraph-based approach to enhance
computational efficiency. By processing only relevant subgraphs for each target
interaction, DGAKT significantly reduces memory and computational requirements
compared to full global graph models. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that DGAKT not only outperforms existing KT models but also sets a
new standard in resource efficiency, addressing a critical need that has been
largely overlooked by prior KT approaches.

Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek
into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing,
additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a
model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of
these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe
from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In
this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's
representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for
a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular
the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings
through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models
and datasets.

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) with knowledge in both scientific and general
tasks is the foundation of science general intelligence. However, directly
continued pretraining an LLM using science data usually leads to catastrophic
forgetting, which indicates severe degradation in general ability. In this
report, we present Innovator, which solves this problem by upcycling a
pre-trained dense LLM into a fine-grained Mixtures-of-Experts model during
continued pretraining, where different experts are expected to learn science
knowledge in different disciplines, and a shared expert is utilized for general
tasks. Innovator introduces a four-stage upcycle training paradigm: (1)
Scientific Expert Induction on discipline-specific data, (2) Fine-grained
Expert Splitting via FFN dimension decomposition, (3) Science-Aware Routing
warmup, and (4) Generalist-Scientist Integration training on hybrid datasets.
Such a paradigm enables knowledge in the general domain, and different
scientific disciplines can be decoupled, avoiding the negative influence among
knowledge in different domains. With 53.3B total parameters and 13.3B
activated, Innovator extends Qwen2.5-7B using a shared general expert and 64
specialized scientific experts with 8 activated. Trained on 300B tokens with
tri-level quality-controlled data, Innovator achieves 25% average improvement
across 30 scientific tasks with a win rate as 70%, while retaining 99%
performance in general tasks. Furthermore, Innovator-Reason, which is
post-trained from Innovator for reasoning boosting, exhibits excellent
reasoning performance in solving complex scientific problems with improvements
over 30%.

Abstract: This thesis presents the results of a comprehensive research project focused
on applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the problem of market making in
financial markets. Market makers (MMs) play a fundamental role in providing
liquidity, yet face significant challenges arising from inventory risk,
competition, and non-stationary market dynamics. This research explores how RL,
particularly Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), can be employed to develop
autonomous, adaptive, and profitable market making strategies.
  The study begins by formulating the MM task as a reinforcement learning
problem, designing agents capable of operating in both single-agent and
multi-agent settings within a simulated financial environment. It then
addresses the complex issue of inventory management using two complementary
approaches: reward engineering and Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
(MORL). While the former uses dynamic reward shaping to guide behavior, the
latter leverages Pareto front optimization to explicitly balance competing
objectives.
  To address the problem of non-stationarity, the research introduces POW-dTS,
a novel policy weighting algorithm based on Discounted Thompson Sampling. This
method allows agents to dynamically select and combine pretrained policies,
enabling continual adaptation to shifting market conditions.
  The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RL-based approaches
significantly outperform traditional and baseline algorithmic strategies across
various performance metrics. Overall, this research thesis contributes new
methodologies and insights for the design of robust, efficient, and adaptive
market making agents, reinforcing the potential of RL to transform algorithmic
trading in complex financial systems.

Result: 实验表明，MIA评估不可靠，设计了新指标验证un-pruning的有效性。

Conclusion: un-pruning方法适用于多种稀疏模型和遗忘算法，理论误差有上界。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to efficiently eliminate the memory about deleted
data from trained models and address the right to be forgotten. Despite the
success of existing unlearning algorithms, unlearning in sparse models has not
yet been well studied. In this paper, we empirically find that the deleted data
has an impact on the pruned topology in a sparse model. Motivated by the
observation and the right to be forgotten, we define a new terminology
``un-pruning" to eliminate the impact of deleted data on model pruning. Then we
propose an un-pruning algorithm to approximate the pruned topology driven by
retained data. We remark that any existing unlearning algorithm can be
integrated with the proposed un-pruning workflow and the error of un-pruning is
upper-bounded in theory. Also, our un-pruning algorithm can be applied to both
structured sparse models and unstructured sparse models. In the experiment, we
further find that Membership Inference Attack (MIA) accuracy is unreliable for
assessing whether a model has forgotten deleted data, as a small change in the
amount of deleted data can produce arbitrary MIA results. Accordingly, we
devise new performance metrics for sparse models to evaluate the success of
un-pruning. Lastly, we conduct extensive experiments to verify the efficacy of
un-pruning with various pruning methods and unlearning algorithms. Our code is
released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/UnlearningSparseModels-FBC5/.

Result: 贪婪线性模型在大多数数据集上表现最佳，超参数优化也倾向于最小化探索的配置。

Conclusion: 离线评估方法存在显著不足，亟需开发更鲁棒的评估框架以准确反映探索效果。

Abstract: Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms are widely used in recommender systems
that require continuous, incremental learning. A core aspect of MABs is the
exploration-exploitation trade-off: choosing between exploiting items likely to
be enjoyed and exploring new ones to gather information. In contextual linear
bandits, this trade-off is particularly central, as many variants share the
same linear regression backbone and differ primarily in their exploration
strategies. Despite its prevalent use, offline evaluation of MABs is
increasingly recognized for its limitations in reliably assessing exploration
behavior. This study conducts an extensive offline empirical comparison of
several linear MABs. Strikingly, across over 90% of various datasets, a greedy
linear model, with no type of exploration, consistently achieves top-tier
performance, often outperforming or matching its exploratory counterparts. This
observation is further corroborated by hyperparameter optimization, which
consistently favors configurations that minimize exploration, suggesting that
pure exploitation is the dominant strategy within these evaluation settings.
Our results expose significant inadequacies in offline evaluation protocols for
bandits, particularly concerning their capacity to reflect true exploratory
efficacy. Consequently, this research underscores the urgent necessity for
developing more robust assessment methodologies, guiding future investigations
into alternative evaluation frameworks for interactive learning in recommender
systems.

Result: CLEAR-VAE能交换和插值内容与风格，并在新内容风格组合下提升分类性能。

Conclusion: CLEAR有效分离任务相关与无关特征，提升模型鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning representations unaffected by superficial characteristics is
important to ensure that shifts in these characteristics at test time do not
compromise downstream prediction performance. For instance, in healthcare
applications, we might like to learn features that contain information about
pathology yet are unaffected by race, sex, and other sources of physiologic
variability, thereby ensuring predictions are equitable and generalizable
across all demographics. Here we propose Contrastive LEarning with
Anti-contrastive Regularization (CLEAR), an intuitive and easy-to-implement
framework that effectively separates essential (i.e., task-relevant)
characteristics from superficial (i.e., task-irrelevant) characteristics during
training, leading to better performance when superficial characteristics shift
at test time. We begin by supposing that data representations can be
semantically separated into task-relevant content features, which contain
information relevant to downstream tasks, and task-irrelevant style features,
which encompass superficial attributes that are irrelevant to these tasks, yet
may degrade performance due to associations with content present in training
data that do not generalize. We then prove that our anti-contrastive penalty,
which we call Pair-Switching (PS), minimizes the Mutual Information between the
style attributes and content labels. Finally, we instantiate CLEAR in the
latent space of a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), then perform experiments to
quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the resulting CLEAR-VAE over several
image datasets. Our results show that CLEAR-VAE allows us to: (a) swap and
interpolate content and style between any pair of samples, and (b) improve
downstream classification performance in the presence of previously unseen
combinations of content and style. Our code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: Ralts是一种高效且通用的解决方案，能够有效增强GNN对硬件错误的抵抗力，同时保持执行效率。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely applied in safety-critical
applications, such as financial and medical networks, in which compromised
predictions may cause catastrophic consequences. While existing research on GNN
robustness has primarily focused on software-level threats, hardware-induced
faults and errors remain largely underexplored. As hardware systems progress
toward advanced technology nodes to meet high-performance and energy efficiency
demands, they become increasingly susceptible to transient faults, which can
cause bit flips and silent data corruption, a prominent issue observed by major
technology companies (e.g., Meta and Google). In response, we first present a
comprehensive analysis of GNN robustness against bit-flip errors, aiming to
reveal system-level optimization opportunities for future reliable and
efficient GNN systems. Second, we propose Ralts, a generalizable and
lightweight solution to bolster GNN resilience to bit-flip errors.
Specifically, Ralts exploits various graph similarity metrics to filter out
outliers and recover compromised graph topology, and incorporates these
protective techniques directly into aggregation functions to support any
message-passing GNNs. Evaluation results demonstrate that Ralts effectively
enhances GNN robustness across a range of GNN models, graph datasets, error
patterns, and both dense and sparse architectures. On average, under a BER of
$3\times10^{-5}$, these robust aggregation functions improve prediction
accuracy by at least 20\% when errors present in model weights or node
embeddings, and by at least 10\% when errors occur in adjacency matrices. Ralts
is also optimized to deliver execution efficiency comparable to built-in
aggregation functions in PyTorch Geometric.

### [119] [Fishers for Free? Approximating the Fisher Information Matrix by Recycling the Squared Gradient Accumulator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18807)
*YuXin Li,Felix Dangel,Derek Tam,Colin Raffel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为'Squisher'的方法，通过复用训练过程中已计算的梯度平方累加器来近似Fisher对角矩阵，从而节省计算成本。实验表明，该方法在性能上与Fisher对角矩阵相当，且优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Fisher对角矩阵常用于衡量参数敏感性，但其计算成本较高。而自适应梯度方法（如Adam）在训练过程中已计算了梯度平方的移动平均，因此探索是否可以利用这些已有数据近似Fisher对角矩阵。

Method: 提出'Squisher'方法，通过复用训练中已计算的梯度平方累加器来近似Fisher对角矩阵。

Result: 实验表明，Squisher在五种应用中与Fisher对角矩阵性能相似，且优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Squisher是一种高效且性能接近Fisher对角矩阵的近似方法，同时明确了其与Fisher对角矩阵的具体差异及其影响。

Abstract: The diagonal of a model's Fisher Information Matrix (the "Fisher diagonal")
has frequently been used as a way to measure parameter sensitivity. Typically,
the Fisher diagonal is estimated via squared sampled gradients of the model's
likelihood with respect to its parameters, averaged over a few hundred or
thousand examples -- a process which incurs nontrivial computational costs. At
the same time, adaptive gradient methods like the ubiquitous Adam optimizer
compute a moving average of the squared gradient over the course of training.
This paper therefore explores whether an approximation of the Fisher diagonal
can be obtained "for free" by recycling the squared gradient accumulator that
has already been computed over the course of training. Through a comprehensive
set of experiments covering five applications of the Fisher diagonal, we
demonstrate that the "Squisher" (SQUared gradient accumulator as an
approximation of the FISHER) consistently performs similarly to the Fisher
diagonal while outperforming baseline methods. Additionally, we clarify the
exact differences between the Squisher and the Fisher diagonal and provide
empirical quantification of their respective impact.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于目标条件测试时训练（GC-TTT）的离线强化学习算法，通过自监督数据选择优化策略，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过测试时训练优化离线强化学习策略，以低成本实现高性能。

Method: 提出自监督数据选择标准，从离线数据集中筛选与当前状态和目标相关的样本，进行少量梯度步微调。

Result: 在多个高维任务中，GC-TTT显著优于标准离线预训练，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: GC-TTT在推理时通过动态调整策略，证明了其优于单纯扩大模型规模的效果。

Abstract: Foundation models compress a large amount of information in a single, large
neural network, which can then be queried for individual tasks. There are
strong parallels between this widespread framework and offline goal-conditioned
reinforcement learning algorithms: a universal value function is trained on a
large number of goals, and the policy is evaluated on a single goal in each
test episode. Extensive research in foundation models has shown that
performance can be substantially improved through test-time training,
specializing the model to the current goal. We find similarly that test-time
offline reinforcement learning on experience related to the test goal can lead
to substantially better policies at minimal compute costs. We propose a novel
self-supervised data selection criterion, which selects transitions from an
offline dataset according to their relevance to the current state and quality
with respect to the evaluation goal. We demonstrate across a wide range of
high-dimensional loco-navigation and manipulation tasks that fine-tuning a
policy on the selected data for a few gradient steps leads to significant
performance gains over standard offline pre-training. Our goal-conditioned
test-time training (GC-TTT) algorithm applies this routine in a
receding-horizon fashion during evaluation, adapting the policy to the current
trajectory as it is being rolled out. Finally, we study compute allocation at
inference, demonstrating that, at comparable costs, GC-TTT induces performance
gains that are not achievable by scaling model size.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative neural networks, particularly flow matching
(FM), have enabled the generation of high-fidelity samples while significantly
reducing computational costs. A promising application of these models is
accelerating simulations in high-energy physics (HEP), helping research
institutions meet their increasing computational demands. In this work, we
leverage FM to develop surrogate models for fast simulations of zero degree
calorimeters in the ALICE experiment. We present an effective training strategy
that enables the training of fast generative models with an exceptionally low
number of parameters. This approach achieves state-of-the-art simulation
fidelity for both neutron (ZN) and proton (ZP) detectors, while offering
substantial reductions in computational costs compared to existing methods. Our
FM model achieves a Wasserstein distance of 1.27 for the ZN simulation with an
inference time of 0.46 ms per sample, compared to the current best of 1.20 with
an inference time of approximately 109 ms. The latent FM model further improves
the inference speed, reducing the sampling time to 0.026 ms per sample, with a
minimal trade-off in accuracy. Similarly, our approach achieves a Wasserstein
distance of 1.30 for the ZP simulation, outperforming the current best of 2.08.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在求解PDE时无法泛化到训练数据之外，例如固定Reynolds数或预定义域。

Method: 利用PDE的尺度一致性特性，设计尺度一致性损失函数，训练尺度感知神经算子。

Result: 模型在Burgers方程、Darcy Flow、Helmholtz方程和Navier-Stokes方程上表现优异，泛化能力显著提升，平均误差降低34%。

Conclusion: 尺度一致性损失和尺度感知神经算子有效提升了PDE求解的泛化能力。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models have emerged as a promising approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in science and engineering. Previous ML
models typically cannot generalize outside the training data; for example, a
trained ML model for the Navier-Stokes equations only works for a fixed
Reynolds number ($Re$) on a pre-defined domain. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a data augmentation scheme based on scale-consistency properties of
PDEs and design a scale-informed neural operator that can model a wide range of
scales. Our formulation leverages the facts: (i) PDEs can be rescaled, or more
concretely, a given domain can be re-scaled to unit size, and the parameters
and the boundary conditions of the PDE can be appropriately adjusted to
represent the original solution, and (ii) the solution operators on a given
domain are consistent on the sub-domains. We leverage these facts to create a
scale-consistency loss that encourages matching the solutions evaluated on a
given domain and the solution obtained on its sub-domain from the rescaled PDE.
Since neural operators can fit to multiple scales and resolutions, they are the
natural choice for incorporating scale-consistency loss during training of
neural PDE solvers. We experiment with scale-consistency loss and the
scale-informed neural operator model on the Burgers' equation, Darcy Flow,
Helmholtz equation, and Navier-Stokes equations. With scale-consistency, the
model trained on $Re$ of 1000 can generalize to $Re$ ranging from 250 to 10000,
and reduces the error by 34% on average of all datasets compared to baselines.

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，该方法显著提升了强模型在推理和决策任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展性和鲁棒性，为W2SG在复杂任务中的应用提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Weak-to-Strong generalization (W2SG) is a new trend to elicit the full
capabilities of a strong model with supervision from a weak model. While
existing W2SG studies focus on simple tasks like binary classification, we
extend this paradigm to complex interactive decision-making environments.
Specifically, we fine-tune a strong model with trajectories of intermediate
actions generated by a weak model. Motivated by the human learning process, we
propose to generalize not only success knowledge but also failure experience so
that the strong model can learn from failed trajectories accumulated by weak
models. To effectively and efficiently elicit the potential of strong agents,
we further construct ``trajectory trees," a hierarchical representation that
organizes weak model-generated action trajectories, coupled with Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) to optimize the strong model. Through theoretical analysis,
we provide formal guarantees for the effectiveness of our method in improving
W2SG performance. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate substantial
improvements in reasoning and decision-making capabilities across diverse task
domains, validating the scalability and robustness of our proposed framework.

Motivation: 高血压肾病患者在ICU中短期死亡率高，但缺乏定制化的风险预测工具，早期识别高风险患者对临床决策至关重要。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV v2.2数据库的早期临床数据，筛选18个临床特征，训练并比较多个模型，CatBoost表现最优。

Result: CatBoost在独立测试集上AUROC为0.88，敏感性0.811，特异性0.798，模型依赖有意义的预测因子如意识状态、血管加压药使用和凝血状态。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个可解释的机器学习流程，结合高预测性能和不确定性量化，支持个体化分诊和透明的临床决策，适合临床部署并需外部验证。

Abstract: Background: Hypertensive kidney disease (HKD) patients in intensive care
units (ICUs) face high short-term mortality, but tailored risk prediction tools
are lacking. Early identification of high-risk individuals is crucial for
clinical decision-making. Methods: We developed a machine learning framework to
predict 30-day in-hospital mortality among ICU patients with HKD using early
clinical data from the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database. A cohort of 1,366 adults was
curated with strict criteria, excluding malignancy cases. Eighteen clinical
features-including vital signs, labs, comorbidities, and therapies-were
selected via random forest importance and mutual information filtering. Several
models were trained and compared with stratified five-fold cross-validation;
CatBoost demonstrated the best performance. Results: CatBoost achieved an AUROC
of 0.88 on the independent test set, with sensitivity of 0.811 and specificity
of 0.798. SHAP values and Accumulated Local Effects (ALE) plots showed the
model relied on meaningful predictors such as altered consciousness,
vasopressor use, and coagulation status. Additionally, the DREAM algorithm was
integrated to estimate patient-specific posterior risk distributions, allowing
clinicians to assess both predicted mortality and its uncertainty. Conclusions:
We present an interpretable machine learning pipeline for early, real-time risk
assessment in ICU patients with HKD. By combining high predictive performance
with uncertainty quantification, our model supports individualized triage and
transparent clinical decisions. This approach shows promise for clinical
deployment and merits external validation in broader critical care populations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测血脑屏障通透性对中枢神经系统药物开发至关重要。现有图神经网络（GNNs）通常依赖分子拓扑结构，忽略了三维几何信息，而后者对模拟传输机制至关重要。

Method: GMC-MPNN通过构建基于原子类型的加权彩色子图，捕捉空间关系和化学背景。模型在三个基准数据集上进行了分类和回归任务的评估，采用严格的支架分割以确保泛化能力。

Result: GMC-MPNN在分类（AUC-ROC达0.9704和0.9685）和回归（RMSE为0.4609，Pearson相关系数为0.7759）任务中均优于现有最优模型。消融实验验证了特定原子对相互作用的重要性。

Conclusion: GMC-MPNN通过整合空间几何信息，为药物发现提供了更准确、泛化性更强的工具，并设定了新的性能基准。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of blood-brain barrier permeability (BBBP) is essential
for central nervous system (CNS) drug development. While graph neural networks
(GNNs) have advanced molecular property prediction, they often rely on
molecular topology and neglect the three-dimensional geometric information
crucial for modeling transport mechanisms. This paper introduces the geometric
multi-color message-passing graph neural network (GMC-MPNN), a novel framework
that enhances standard message-passing architectures by explicitly
incorporating atomic-level geometric features and long-range interactions. Our
model constructs weighted colored subgraphs based on atom types to capture the
spatial relationships and chemical context that govern BBB permeability. We
evaluated GMC-MPNN on three benchmark datasets for both classification and
regression tasks, using rigorous scaffold-based splitting to ensure a robust
assessment of generalization. The results demonstrate that GMC-MPNN
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving superior
performance in both classifying compounds as permeable/non-permeable (AUC-ROC
of 0.9704 and 0.9685) and in regressing continuous permeability values (RMSE of
0.4609, Pearson correlation of 0.7759). An ablation study further quantified
the impact of specific atom-pair interactions, revealing that the model's
predictive power derives from its ability to learn from both common and rare,
but chemically significant, functional motifs. By integrating spatial geometry
into the graph representation, GMC-MPNN sets a new performance benchmark and
offers a more accurate and generalizable tool for drug discovery pipelines.

Motivation: 在随机线性多臂老虎机问题中，玩家需要在T次拉臂后识别最佳臂，同时避免观察者（如复制者Chloe）获取最佳臂信息。现有方法要么牺牲隐私（最优算法），要么性能较差（均匀拉臂）。

Method: 提出了一种无需密钥或加密原语的安全算法，通过编码臂的方式隐藏最佳臂信息。

Result: 算法实现了Ω(T/log²(d))的错误指数，同时几乎不泄露最佳臂信息。

Conclusion: 该方法在保护隐私的同时，显著提升了性能，为安全最佳臂识别提供了新思路。

Abstract: Consider the problem of best arm identification with a security constraint.
Specifically, assume a setup of stochastic linear bandits with $K$ arms of
dimension $d$. In each arm pull, the player receives a reward that is the sum
of the dot product of the arm with an unknown parameter vector and independent
noise. The player's goal is to identify the best arm after $T$ arm pulls.
Moreover, assume a copycat Chloe is observing the arm pulls. The player wishes
to keep Chloe ignorant of the best arm.
  While a minimax--optimal algorithm identifies the best arm with an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log(d)}\right)$ error exponent, it easily reveals its
best-arm estimate to an outside observer, as the best arms are played more
frequently. A naive secure algorithm that plays all arms equally results in an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{d}\right)$ exponent. In this paper, we propose a secure
algorithm that plays with \emph{coded arms}. The algorithm does not require any
key or cryptographic primitives, yet achieves an
$\Omega\left(\frac{T}{\log^2(d)}\right)$ exponent while revealing almost no
information on the best arm.

Abstract: Forecasting in financial markets remains a significant challenge due to their
nonlinear and regime-dependent dynamics. Traditional deep learning models, such
as long short-term memory networks and multilayer perceptrons, often struggle
to generalize across shifting market conditions, highlighting the need for a
more adaptive and interpretable approach. To address this, we introduce
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks for stock prediction and explainable regimes
(KASPER), a novel framework that integrates regime detection, sparse
spline-based function modeling, and symbolic rule extraction. The framework
identifies hidden market conditions using a Gumbel-Softmax-based mechanism,
enabling regime-specific forecasting. For each regime, it employs
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks with sparse spline activations to capture intricate
price behaviors while maintaining robustness. Interpretability is achieved
through symbolic learning based on Monte Carlo Shapley values, which extracts
human-readable rules tailored to each regime. Applied to real-world financial
time series from Yahoo Finance, the model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.89, a
Sharpe Ratio of 12.02, and a mean squared error as low as 0.0001, outperforming
existing methods. This research establishes a new direction for regime-aware,
transparent, and robust forecasting in financial markets.

Abstract: Differentiated thyroid cancer DTC recurrence is a major public health
concern, requiring classification and predictive models that are not only
accurate but also interpretable and uncertainty aware. This study introduces a
comprehensive framework for DTC recurrence classification using a dataset
containing 383 patients and 16 clinical and pathological variables. Initially,
11 machine learning ML models were employed using the complete dataset, where
the Support Vector Machines SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 0.9481.
To reduce complexity and redundancy, feature selection was carried out using
the Boruta algorithm, and the same ML models were applied to the reduced
dataset, where it was observed that the Logistic Regression LR model obtained
the maximum accuracy of 0.9611. However, these ML models often lack uncertainty
quantification, which is critical in clinical decision making. Therefore, to
address this limitation, the Bayesian Neural Networks BNN with six varying
prior distributions, including Normal 0,1, Normal 0,10, Laplace 0,1, Cauchy
0,1, Cauchy 0,2.5, and Horseshoe 1, were implemented on both the complete and
reduced datasets. The BNN model with Normal 0,10 prior distribution exhibited
maximum accuracies of 0.9740 and 0.9870 before and after feature selection,

Abstract: As AI workloads proliferate, optimizing arithmetic units is becoming
increasingly important to reduce the footprint of digital systems. Conventional
design flows, which often rely on manual or heuristics-based optimization, are
limited in their ability to thoroughly explore the vast design space. In this
paper, we introduce GENIAL, a machine learning-based framework for the
automatic generation and optimization of arithmetic units, more specifically
multipliers.
  At the core of GENIAL is a Transformer-based surrogate model trained in two
stages, involving self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised
finetuning, to robustly forecast key hardware metrics such as power and area
from abstracted design representations. By inverting the surrogate model,
GENIAL efficiently searches for new operand encodings that directly minimize
power consumption in arithmetic units for specific input data distributions.
Extensive experiments on large datasets demonstrate that GENIAL is consistently
more sample efficient than other methods, and converges faster towards
optimized designs. This enables to deploy a high-effort logic synthesis
optimization flow in the loop, improving the accuracy of the surrogate model.
Notably, GENIAL automatically discovers encodings that achieve up to 18%
switching activity savings within multipliers on representative AI workloads
compared with the conventional two's complement. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our approach by achieving significant improvements on Finite
State Machines, highlighting GENIAL's applicability for a wide spectrum of
logic functions. Together, these advances mark a significant step toward
automated Quality-of-Results-optimized combinational circuit generation for
digital systems.

Motivation: 现实强化学习中随机延迟反馈违反马尔可夫假设，现有方法多针对恒定延迟，随机延迟研究较少。

Method: 提出保守智能体，将随机延迟环境转化为恒定延迟等效环境，无需修改算法结构。

Result: 在连续控制任务中，保守智能体在渐近性能和样本效率上显著优于基线算法。

Conclusion: 保守智能体为随机延迟环境提供了一种简单且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning applications are often hindered by delayed
feedback from environments, which violates the Markov assumption and introduces
significant challenges. Although numerous delay-compensating methods have been
proposed for environments with constant delays, environments with random delays
remain largely unexplored due to their inherent variability and
unpredictability. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust agent for
decision-making under random delays, termed the conservative agent, which
reformulates the random-delay environment into its constant-delay equivalent.
This transformation enables any state-of-the-art constant-delay method to be
directly extended to the random-delay environments without modifying the
algorithmic structure or sacrificing performance. We evaluate the conservative
agent-based algorithm on continuous control tasks, and empirical results
demonstrate that it significantly outperforms existing baseline algorithms in
terms of asymptotic performance and sample efficiency.

Result: 在七个基准测试中，FADE在严重分布变化下准确率最高提升19%，优于TENT和DIW。

Conclusion: FADE在理论和实验上均表现出鲁棒性，适用于联邦学习等分散环境。

Abstract: Modern machine learning systems operating in dynamic environments often face
\textit{sequential covariate shift} (SCS), where input distributions evolve
over time while the conditional distribution remains stable. We introduce FADE
(Fisher-based Adaptation to Dynamic Environments), a lightweight and
theoretically grounded framework for robust learning under SCS. FADE employs a
shift-aware regularization mechanism anchored in Fisher information geometry,
guiding adaptation by modulating parameter updates based on sensitivity and
stability. To detect significant distribution changes, we propose a
Cramer-Rao-informed shift signal that integrates KL divergence with temporal
Fisher dynamics. Unlike prior methods requiring task boundaries, target
supervision, or experience replay, FADE operates online with fixed memory and
no access to target labels. Evaluated on seven benchmarks spanning vision,
language, and tabular data, FADE achieves up to 19\% higher accuracy under
severe shifts, outperforming methods such as TENT and DIW. FADE also
generalizes naturally to federated learning by treating heterogeneous clients
as temporally fragmented environments, enabling scalable and stable adaptation
in decentralized settings. Theoretical analysis guarantees bounded regret and
parameter consistency, while empirical results demonstrate FADE's robustness
across modalities and shift intensities.

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将GBM与扩散模型结合，为金融时间序列生成提供了更符合实际特性的方法。

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based generative framework for financial time
series that incorporates geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the foundation of the
Black--Scholes theory, into the forward noising process. Unlike standard
score-based models that treat price trajectories as generic numerical
sequences, our method injects noise proportionally to asset prices at each time
step, reflecting the heteroskedasticity observed in financial time series. By
accurately balancing the drift and diffusion terms, we show that the resulting
log-price process reduces to a variance-exploding stochastic differential
equation, aligning with the formulation in score-based generative models. The
reverse-time generative process is trained via denoising score matching using a
Transformer-based architecture adapted from the Conditional Score-based
Diffusion Imputation (CSDI) framework. Empirical evaluations on historical
stock data demonstrate that our model reproduces key stylized facts
heavy-tailed return distributions, volatility clustering, and the leverage
effect more realistically than conventional diffusion models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a paradigm increasingly used to align large
language models. Popular RL algorithms utilize multiple workers and can be
modeled as a graph, where each node is the status of a worker and each edge
represents dataflow between nodes. Owing to the heavy cross-node dependencies,
the RL training system usually suffers from poor cluster scalability and low
memory utilization. In this article, we introduce MindSpeed RL, an effective
and efficient system for large-scale RL training. Unlike existing centralized
methods, MindSpeed RL organizes the essential data dependencies in RL training,
i.e., sample flow and resharding flow, from a distributed view. On the one
hand, a distributed transfer dock strategy, which sets controllers and
warehouses on the basis of the conventional replay buffer, is designed to
release the dispatch overhead in the sample flow. A practical allgather--swap
strategy is presented to eliminate redundant memory usage in resharding flow.
In addition, MindSpeed RL further integrates numerous parallelization
strategies and acceleration techniques for systematic optimization. Compared
with existing state-of-the-art systems, comprehensive experiments on the RL
training of popular Qwen2.5-Dense-7B/32B, Qwen3-MoE-30B, and
DeepSeek-R1-MoE-671B show that MindSpeed RL increases the throughput by 1.42 ~
3.97 times. Finally, we open--source MindSpeed RL and perform all the
experiments on a super pod of Ascend with 384 neural processing units (NPUs) to
demonstrate the powerful performance and reliability of Ascend.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有G2M方法无法动态调整推理成本和准确性，限制了其在资源多变场景中的应用。

Method: 采用渐进式训练结构（PTS）、渐进式知识蒸馏（PKD）和渐进式混合增强（PMA）来优化蒸馏过程。

Result: 在八个真实图数据集上验证，ProGMLP在保持高准确性的同时动态适应不同运行场景。

Conclusion: ProGMLP适用于多样化的应用场景，提供灵活的推理成本与准确性权衡。

Abstract: GNN-to-MLP (G2M) methods have emerged as a promising approach to accelerate
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by distilling their knowledge into simpler
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). These methods bridge the gap between the
expressive power of GNNs and the computational efficiency of MLPs, making them
well-suited for resource-constrained environments. However, existing G2M
methods are limited by their inability to flexibly adjust inference cost and
accuracy dynamically, a critical requirement for real-world applications where
computational resources and time constraints can vary significantly. To address
this, we introduce a Progressive framework designed to offer flexible and
on-demand trade-offs between inference cost and accuracy for GNN-to-MLP
knowledge distillation (ProGMLP). ProGMLP employs a Progressive Training
Structure (PTS), where multiple MLP students are trained in sequence, each
building on the previous one. Furthermore, ProGMLP incorporates Progressive
Knowledge Distillation (PKD) to iteratively refine the distillation process
from GNNs to MLPs, and Progressive Mixup Augmentation (PMA) to enhance
generalization by progressively generating harder mixed samples. Our approach
is validated through comprehensive experiments on eight real-world graph
datasets, demonstrating that ProGMLP maintains high accuracy while dynamically
adapting to varying runtime scenarios, making it highly effective for
deployment in diverse application settings.

Conclusion: 神经常微分方程为学习复杂分岔结构提供了有效工具，尤其在数据有限或噪声条件下表现良好，但其准确性依赖于数据质量。

Abstract: Forecasting system behaviour near and across bifurcations is crucial for
identifying potential shifts in dynamical systems. While machine learning has
recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures
from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on
discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we
use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a continuous,
data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. We apply our approach to a
predator-prey system that features both local and global bifurcations,
presenting a challenging test case. Our results show that Neural Ordinary
Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly
from timeseries data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we
demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast
bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training
data. We also assess the method's performance under limited and noisy data
conditions, finding that model accuracy depends more on the quality of
information that can be inferred from the training data, than on the amount of
data available.

Conclusion: DyRC-VG框架通过直接从数据中推断储层结构，显著提升了储层计算的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of complex and nonlinear time series remains a
challenging problem across engineering and scientific disciplines. Reservoir
computing (RC) offers a computationally efficient alternative to traditional
deep learning by training only the read-out layer while employing a randomly
structured and fixed reservoir network. Despite its advantages, the largely
random reservoir graph architecture often results in suboptimal and oversized
networks with poorly understood dynamics. Addressing this issue, we propose a
novel Dynamics-Informed Reservoir Computing (DyRC) framework that
systematically infers the reservoir network structure directly from the input
training sequence. This work proposes to employ the visibility graph (VG)
technique, which converts time series data into networks by representing
measurement points as nodes linked by mutual visibility. The reservoir network
is constructed by directly adopting the VG network from a training data
sequence, leveraging the parameter-free visibility graph approach to avoid
expensive hyperparameter tuning. This process results in a reservoir that is
directly informed by the specific dynamics of the prediction task under study.
We assess the DyRC-VG method through prediction tasks involving the canonical
nonlinear Duffing oscillator, evaluating prediction accuracy and consistency.
Compared to an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph of the same size, spectral radius, and
comparable density, we observe higher prediction quality and more consistent
performance over repeated implementations in the DyRC-VG.

Abstract: Molecular assembly offers a promising path to detect life beyond Earth, while
minimizing assumptions based on terrestrial life. As mass spectrometers will be
central to upcoming Solar System missions, predicting molecular assembly from
their data without needing to elucidate unknown structures will be essential
for unbiased life detection. An ideal agnostic biosignature must be
interpretable and experimentally measurable. Here, we show that molecular
assembly, a recently developed approach to measure objects that have been
produced by evolution, satisfies both criteria. First, it is interpretable for
life detection, as it reflects the assembly of molecules with their bonds as
building blocks, in contrast to approaches that discount construction history.
Second, it can be determined without structural elucidation, as it can be
physically measured by mass spectrometry, a property that distinguishes it from
other approaches that use structure-based information measures for molecular
complexity. Whilst molecular assembly is directly measurable using mass
spectrometry data, there are limits imposed by mission constraints. To address
this, we developed a machine learning model that predicts molecular assembly
with high accuracy, reducing error by three-fold compared to baseline models.
Simulated data shows that even small instrumental inconsistencies can double
model error, emphasizing the need for standardization. These results suggest
that standardized mass spectrometry databases could enable accurate molecular
assembly prediction, without structural elucidation, providing a
proof-of-concept for future astrobiology missions.

Result: 实验证明CGIR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CGIR将属性缺失图聚类分解为子簇搜索与合并，实现了节点填补和嵌入优化的统一框架。

Abstract: Attribute-missing graph clustering has emerged as a significant unsupervised
task, where only attribute vectors of partial nodes are available and the graph
structure is intact. The related models generally follow the two-step paradigm
of imputation and refinement. However, most imputation approaches fail to
capture class-relevant semantic information, leading to sub-optimal imputation
for clustering. Moreover, existing refinement strategies optimize the learned
embedding through graph reconstruction, while neglecting the fact that some
attributes are uncorrelated with the graph. To remedy the problems, we
establish the Clustering-oriented Generative Imputation with reliable
Refinement (CGIR) model. Concretely, the subcluster distributions are estimated
to reveal the class-specific characteristics precisely, and constrain the
sampling space of the generative adversarial module, such that the imputation
nodes are impelled to align with the correct clusters. Afterwards, multiple
subclusters are merged to guide the proposed edge attention network, which
identifies the edge-wise attributes for each class, so as to avoid the
redundant attributes in graph reconstruction from disturbing the refinement of
overall embedding. To sum up, CGIR splits attribute-missing graph clustering
into the search and mergence of subclusters, which guides to implement node
imputation and refinement within a unified framework. Extensive experiments
prove the advantages of CGIR over state-of-the-art competitors.

Conclusion: GCL-GCN通过创新模块显著提升了图聚类的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Attributed graph clustering holds significant importance in modern data
analysis. However, due to the complexity of graph data and the heterogeneity of
node attributes, leveraging graph information for clustering remains
challenging. To address this, we propose a novel deep graph clustering model,
GCL-GCN, specifically designed to address the limitations of existing models in
capturing local dependencies and complex structures when dealing with sparse
and heterogeneous graph data. GCL-GCN introduces an innovative Graphormer
module that combines centrality encoding and spatial relationships, effectively
capturing both global and local information between nodes, thereby enhancing
the quality of node representations. Additionally, we propose a novel
contrastive learning module that significantly enhances the discriminative
power of feature representations. In the pre-training phase, this module
increases feature distinction through contrastive learning on the original
feature matrix, ensuring more identifiable initial representations for
subsequent graph convolution and clustering tasks. Extensive experimental
results on six datasets demonstrate that GCL-GCN outperforms 14 advanced
methods in terms of clustering quality and robustness. Specifically, on the
Cora dataset, it improves ACC, NMI, and ARI by 4.94%, 13.01%, and 10.97%,
respectively, compared to the primary comparison method MBN.

Conclusion: 该框架为数据发布阶段的隐私保护提供了理论保证和实用方法，尤其适用于离散变量图的场景。

Abstract: Ensuring privacy in large-scale open datasets is increasingly challenging
under regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While
differential privacy (DP) provides strong theoretical guarantees, it primarily
focuses on noise injection during model training, neglecting privacy
preservation at the data publishing stage. Existing privacy-preserving data
publishing (PPDP) approaches struggle to balance privacy and utility,
particularly when data publishers and users are distinct entities. To address
this gap, we focus on the graph recovery problem and propose a novel
privacy-preserving estimation framework for open graph data, leveraging
Gaussian DP (GDP) with a structured noise-injection mechanism. Unlike
traditional methods that perturb gradients or model updates, our approach
ensures unbiased graph structure recovery while enforcing DP at the data
publishing stage. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees on estimation
accuracy and extend our method to discrete-variable graphs, a setting often
overlooked in DP research. Experimental results in graph learning demonstrate
robust performance, offering a viable solution for privacy-conscious graph
analysis.

Abstract: Accurate detection and localization of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels in
satellite imagery is essential for optimizing microgrids and active
distribution networks (ADNs), which are critical components of renewable energy
systems. Existing methods lack transparency regarding their underlying
algorithms or training datasets, rely on large, high-quality PV training data,
and struggle to generalize to new geographic regions or varied environmental
conditions without extensive re-training. These limitations lead to
inconsistent detection outcomes, hindering large-scale deployment and
data-driven grid optimization. In this paper, we investigate how large language
models (LLMs) can be leveraged to overcome these challenges. Despite their
promise, LLMs face several challenges in solar panel detection, including
difficulties with multi-step logical processes, inconsistent output formatting,
frequent misclassification of visually similar objects (e.g., shadows, parking
lots), and low accuracy in complex tasks such as spatial localization and
quantification. To overcome these issues, we propose the PV Assessment with
LLMs (PVAL) framework, which incorporates task decomposition for more efficient
workflows, output standardization for consistent and scalable formatting,
few-shot prompting to enhance classification accuracy, and fine-tuning using
curated PV datasets with detailed annotations. PVAL ensures transparency,
scalability, and adaptability across heterogeneous datasets while minimizing
computational overhead. By combining open-source accessibility with robust
methodologies, PVAL establishes an automated and reproducible pipeline for
solar panel detection, paving the way for large-scale renewable energy
integration and optimized grid management.

Abstract: Commercial high-voltage circuit breaker (CB) condition monitoring systems
rely on directly observable physical parameters such as gas filling pressure
with pre-defined thresholds. While these parameters are crucial, they only
cover a small subset of malfunctioning mechanisms and usually can be monitored
only if the CB is disconnected from the grid. To facilitate online condition
monitoring while CBs remain connected, non-intrusive measurement techniques
such as vibration or acoustic signals are necessary. Currently, CB condition
monitoring studies using these signals typically utilize supervised methods for
fault diagnostics, where ground-truth fault types are known due to artificially
introduced faults in laboratory settings. This supervised approach is however
not feasible in real-world applications, where fault labels are unavailable. In
this work, we propose a novel unsupervised fault detection and segmentation
framework for CBs based on vibration and acoustic signals. This framework can
detect deviations from the healthy state. The explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) approach is applied to the detected faults for fault
diagnostics. The specific contributions are: (1) we propose an integrated
unsupervised fault detection and segmentation framework that is capable of
detecting faults and clustering different faults with only healthy data
required during training (2) we provide an unsupervised explainability-guided
fault diagnostics approach using XAI to offer domain experts potential
indications of the aged or faulty components, achieving fault diagnostics
without the prerequisite of ground-truth fault labels. These contributions are
validated using an experimental dataset from a high-voltage CB under healthy
and artificially introduced fault conditions, contributing to more reliable CB
system operation.

Abstract: Early detection of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is critical for
improving patient outcomes, and novel approaches are needed to facilitate early
diagnosis. In this study, we explore the use of automatic cough analysis as a
pre-screening tool for distinguishing between NSCLC patients and healthy
controls. Cough audio recordings were prospectively acquired from a total of
227 subjects, divided into NSCLC patients and healthy controls. The recordings
were analyzed using machine learning techniques, such as support vector machine
(SVM) and XGBoost, as well as deep learning approaches, specifically
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transfer learning with VGG16. To
enhance the interpretability of the machine learning model, we utilized Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP). The fairness of the models across demographic
groups was assessed by comparing the performance of the best model across
different age groups (less than or equal to 58y and higher than 58y) and gender
using the equalized odds difference on the test set. The results demonstrate
that CNN achieves the best performance, with an accuracy of 0.83 on the test
set. Nevertheless, SVM achieves slightly lower performances (accuracy of 0.76
in validation and 0.78 in the test set), making it suitable in contexts with
low computational power. The use of SHAP for SVM interpretation further
enhances model transparency, making it more trustworthy for clinical
applications. Fairness analysis shows slightly higher disparity across age
(0.15) than gender (0.09) on the test set. Therefore, to strengthen our
findings' reliability, a larger, more diverse, and unbiased dataset is needed
-- particularly including individuals at risk of NSCLC and those in early
disease stages.

Conclusion: 通道异质性是VLSI物理布局分析中的关键归纳偏置，WACA机制为相关任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is
critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based
solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this
challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task
on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts.
Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and
current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction
accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention
(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while
suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated
into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and
balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method
outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by
61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that
channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis
for VLSI.

Conclusion: 物理引导的GNN在资源受限的触发系统中具有显著应用潜力。

Abstract: Real-time particle transverse momentum ($p_T$) estimation in high-energy
physics demands algorithms that are both efficient and accurate under strict
hardware constraints. Static machine learning models degrade under high pileup
and lack physics-aware optimization, while generic graph neural networks (GNNs)
often neglect domain structure critical for robust $p_T$ regression. We propose
a physics-informed GNN framework that systematically encodes detector geometry
and physical observables through four distinct graph construction strategies
that systematically encode detector geometry and physical observables:
station-as-node, feature-as-node, bending angle-centric, and pseudorapidity
($\eta$)-centric representations. This framework integrates these tailored
graph structures with a novel Message Passing Layer (MPL), featuring
intra-message attention and gated updates, and domain-specific loss functions
incorporating $p_{T}$-distribution priors. Our co-design methodology yields
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs compared to existing baselines.
Extensive experiments on the CMS Trigger Dataset validate the approach: a
station-informed EdgeConv model achieves a state-of-the-art MAE of 0.8525 with
$\ge55\%$ fewer parameters than deep learning baselines, especially TabNet,
while an $\eta$-centric MPL configuration also demonstrates improved accuracy
with comparable efficiency. These results establish the promise of
physics-guided GNNs for deployment in resource-constrained trigger systems.

*Chaithra Umesh,Kristian Schultz,Manjunath Mahendra,Saptarshi Bej,Olaf Wolkenhauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HFGF框架通过分层生成特征，显著提升了合成表格数据中功能依赖（FDs）和逻辑依赖（LDs）的保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在隐私敏感领域（如医疗）中难以保留特征间的确定性关联（FDs和LDs），导致合成数据质量不足。

Method: 提出HFGF框架，先独立生成特征，再基于预定义的FD和LD规则重建依赖特征。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上验证，HFGF显著提升了六种生成模型（如CTGAN、TVAE）对FDs和LDs的保留能力。

Conclusion: HFGF能显著提升合成数据的结构保真度和下游实用性。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data is increasingly used in privacy-sensitive domains such
as health care, but existing generative models often fail to preserve
inter-attribute relationships. In particular, functional dependencies (FDs) and
logical dependencies (LDs), which capture deterministic and rule-based
associations between features, are rarely or often poorly retained in synthetic
datasets. To address this research gap, we propose the Hierarchical Feature
Generation Framework (HFGF) for synthetic tabular data generation. We created
benchmark datasets with known dependencies to evaluate our proposed HFGF. The
framework first generates independent features using any standard generative
model, and then reconstructs dependent features based on predefined FD and LD
rules. Our experiments on four benchmark datasets with varying sizes, feature
imbalance, and dependency complexity demonstrate that HFGF improves the
preservation of FDs and LDs across six generative models, including CTGAN,
TVAE, and GReaT. Our findings demonstrate that HFGF can significantly enhance
the structural fidelity and downstream utility of synthetic tabular data.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于组件的机器学习（CBML）替代模型，用于快速预测室内气流和温度分布，取代传统计算流体力学（CFD）模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFD模拟计算成本高，难以用于实时或设计迭代流程，需要一种高效替代方法。

Method: 采用三个神经网络：带残差连接的卷积自编码器（CAER）提取特征，多层感知机（MLP）映射入口速度到潜在表示，卷积神经网络（CNN）聚合单入口特征到双入口场景。

Result: CBML模型在训练和测试数据上均能快速准确地预测双入口场景的速度和温度场。

Conclusion: CBML方法为室内气流和温度预测提供了一种高效替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of indoor airflow and temperature
distributions is essential for building energy optimization and occupant
comfort control. However, traditional CFD simulations are computationally
intensive, limiting their integration into real-time or design-iterative
workflows. This study proposes a component-based machine learning (CBML)
surrogate modeling approach to replace conventional CFD simulation for fast
prediction of indoor velocity and temperature fields. The model consists of
three neural networks: a convolutional autoencoder with residual connections
(CAER) to extract and compress flow features, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to
map inlet velocities to latent representations, and a convolutional neural
network (CNN) as an aggregator to combine single-inlet features into dual-inlet
scenarios. A two-dimensional room with varying left and right air inlet
velocities is used as a benchmark case, with CFD simulations providing training
and testing data. Results show that the CBML model accurately and fast predicts
two-component aggregated velocity and temperature fields across both training
and testing datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管自回归语言模型在实践中表现强大，但其负对数似然（NLL）目标为何能产生如此多功能的表示仍缺乏理论解释。

Method: 使用马尔可夫范畴（MCs）框架，将单步生成过程建模为Stoch范畴中马尔可夫核的组合，并结合统计散度分析信息流和学习几何。

Result: 揭示了NLL训练隐含地学习几何结构空间，并提供了现代解码方法的信息论依据。

Conclusion: 该框架揭示了现代语言模型有效性的深层结构原理。

Abstract: Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are
trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While
empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple
objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work
introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to
deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the
single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category
Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,
allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes
three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic
rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,
quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods
exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn
not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a
process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we
prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive
learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,
we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align
with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a
geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This
compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural
principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:

TL;DR: SPADA提出了一种轻量级的生成框架，通过稀疏依赖图解决表格数据增强中的偏差和计算开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量表格数据稀缺，现有方法依赖密集建模导致偏差和计算开销大。

Method: SPADA利用LLM诱导的稀疏依赖图，将特征视为节点，仅基于父节点合成值，采用非参数高斯核密度估计和条件归一化流模型。

Result: 在四个数据集上，SPADA减少约束违规4%，生成速度比基线快9,500倍。

Conclusion: SPADA有效解决了表格数据增强中的偏差和效率问题。

Abstract: Tabular data is critical across diverse domains, yet high-quality datasets
remain scarce due to privacy concerns and the cost of collection. Contemporary
approaches adopt large language models (LLMs) for tabular augmentation, but
exhibit two major limitations: (1) dense dependency modeling among tabular
features that can introduce bias, and (2) high computational overhead in
sampling. To address these issues, we propose SPADA for SPArse
Dependency-driven Augmentation, a lightweight generative framework that
explicitly captures sparse dependencies via an LLM-induced graph. We treat each
feature as a node and synthesize values by traversing the graph, conditioning
each feature solely on its parent nodes. We explore two synthesis strategies: a
non-parametric method using Gaussian kernel density estimation, and a
conditional normalizing flow model that learns invertible mappings for
conditional density estimation. Experiments on four datasets show that SPADA
reduces constraint violations by 4% compared to diffusion-based methods and
accelerates generation by nearly 9,500 times over LLM-based baselines.

Conclusion: 多模态视觉语言模型在短形式视频推荐中具有优势，尤其适用于新平台。

Abstract: In recent years, social media users have spent significant amounts of time on
short-form video platforms. As a result, established platforms in other
domains, such as e-commerce, have begun introducing short-form video content to
engage users and increase their time spent on the platform. The success of
these experiences is due not only to the content itself but also to a unique UI
innovation: instead of offering users a list of choices to click, platforms
actively recommend content for users to watch one at a time. This creates new
challenges for recommender systems, especially when launching a new video
experience. Beyond the limited interaction data, immersive feed experiences
introduce stronger position bias due to the UI and duration bias when
optimizing for watch-time, as models tend to favor shorter videos. These
issues, together with the feedback loop inherent in recommender systems, make
it difficult to build effective solutions. In this paper, we highlight the
challenges faced when introducing a new short-form video experience and present
our experience showing that, even with sufficient video interaction data, it
can be more beneficial to leverage a video retrieval system using a fine-tuned
multimodal vision-language model to overcome these challenges. This approach
demonstrated greater effectiveness compared to conventional supervised learning
methods in online experiments conducted on our e-commerce platform.

Motivation: 在6G无线网络中，高分辨率获取SINR地图成本高昂，因此需要一种高效的方法从稀疏测量中重建空间信号。

Result: 实验表明，GENEO方法在稀疏采样下能准确重建空间信号，性能与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: GENEO框架在数据稀缺情况下表现出色，为无线通信网络中的信号重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In emerging communication systems such as sixth generation (6G) wireless
networks, efficient resource management and service delivery rely on accurate
knowledge of spatially-varying quantities like signal-to-interference-noise
ratio (SINR) maps, which are costly to acquire at high resolution. This work
explores the reconstruction of such spatial signals from sparse measurements
using Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs), offering a
low-complexity alternative to traditional neural networks. The concept of
GENEO, which originated in topological data analysis (TDA), is a mathematical
tool used in machine learning to represent agents modelled as functional
operators acting on data while incorporating application-specific invariances.
Leveraging these invariances reduces the number of parameters with respect to
traditional neural networks and mitigates data scarcity by enforcing known
algebraic and geometric constraints that reflect symmetries in the agents'
actions. In this paper, we introduce a novel GENEO-based approach for SINR map
reconstruction in urban wireless communication networks using extremely sparse
sampling. We demonstrate that this mathematical framework achieves competitive
performance compared to established methods. Our evaluation, conducted using
both statistical and TDA metrics, highlights the advantages of our approach in
accurately reconstructing spatial signals under severe data limitations on the
number of samples.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分析中表现优异，但其黑箱特性引发了可靠性和可解释性的担忧。反事实解释通过假设性场景提供决策过程的透明性，但生成符合相似性约束且可解释的反事实仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过将半监督VAE的潜在空间建模为SPN，利用SPN的双重角色（潜在空间描述符和分类器），优化潜在空间反事实，使其接近原始数据分布并与目标类别分布对齐。

Result: 在cheXpert数据集上的实验表明，SPN引导的潜在空间操作优于神经网络基线，同时分析了潜在变量正则化与反事实质量之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 结合VAE和SPN的方法能够生成高质量且可解释的反事实解释，为深度学习模型的透明性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is increasingly leveraged across various domains to
automate decision-making processes that significantly impact human lives. In
medical image analysis, deep learning models have demonstrated remarkable
performance. However, their inherent complexity makes them black box systems,
raising concerns about reliability and interpretability. Counterfactual
explanations provide comprehensible insights into decision processes by
presenting hypothetical "what-if" scenarios that alter model classifications.
By examining input alterations, counterfactual explanations provide patterns
that influence the decision-making process. Despite their potential, generating
plausible counterfactuals that adhere to similarity constraints providing
human-interpretable explanations remains a challenge. In this paper, we
investigate this challenge by a model-specific optimization approach. While
deep generative models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) exhibit
significant generative power, probabilistic models like sum-product networks
(SPNs) efficiently represent complex joint probability distributions. By
modeling the likelihood of a semi-supervised VAE's latent space with an SPN, we
leverage its dual role as both a latent space descriptor and a classifier for a
given discrimination task. This formulation enables the optimization of latent
space counterfactuals that are both close to the original data distribution and
aligned with the target class distribution. We conduct experimental evaluation
on the cheXpert dataset. To evaluate the effectiveness of the integration of
SPNs, our SPN-guided latent space manipulation is compared against a neural
network baseline. Additionally, the trade-off between latent variable
regularization and counterfactual quality is analyzed.

Abstract: The increasing complexity and volume of financial transactions pose
significant challenges to traditional fraud detection systems. This technical
report investigates and compares the efficacy of classical, quantum, and
quantum-hybrid machine learning models for the binary classification of
fraudulent financial activities.
  As of our methodology, first, we develop a comprehensive behavioural feature
engineering framework to transform raw transactional data into a rich,
descriptive feature set. Second, we implement and evaluate a range of models on
the IBM Anti-Money Laundering (AML) dataset. The classical baseline models
include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. These
are compared against three hybrid classic quantum algorithms architectures: a
Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC),
and a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (HQNN).
  Furthermore, we propose Fraud Detection for Quantum Computing (FD4QC), a
practical, API-driven system architecture designed for real-world deployment,
featuring a classical-first, quantum-enhanced philosophy with robust fallback
mechanisms.
  Our results demonstrate that classical tree-based models, particularly
\textit{Random Forest}, significantly outperform the quantum counterparts in
the current setup, achieving high accuracy (\(97.34\%\)) and F-measure
(\(86.95\%\)). Among the quantum models, \textbf{QSVM} shows the most promise,
delivering high precision (\(77.15\%\)) and a low false-positive rate
(\(1.36\%\)), albeit with lower recall and significant computational overhead.
  This report provides a benchmark for a real-world financial application,
highlights the current limitations of quantum machine learning in this domain,
and outlines promising directions for future research.

Conclusion: 建议在临床中采用集成模型策略以提高诊断可靠性，并在模型共识不足时将决策交由专家审核。

Abstract: Model multiplicity refers to the existence of multiple machine learning
models that describe the data equally well but may produce different
predictions on individual samples. In medicine, these models can admit
conflicting predictions for the same patient -- a risk that is poorly
understood and insufficiently addressed.
  In this study, we empirically analyze the extent, drivers, and ramifications
of predictive multiplicity across diverse medical tasks and model
architectures, and show that even small ensembles can mitigate/eliminate
predictive multiplicity in practice. Our analysis reveals that (1) standard
validation metrics fail to identify a uniquely optimal model and (2) a
substantial amount of predictions hinges on arbitrary choices made during model
development. Using multiple models instead of a single model reveals instances
where predictions differ across equally plausible models -- highlighting
patients that would receive arbitrary diagnoses if any single model were used.
In contrast, (3) a small ensemble paired with an abstention strategy can
effectively mitigate measurable predictive multiplicity in practice;
predictions with high inter-model consensus may thus be amenable to automated
classification. While accuracy is not a principled antidote to predictive
multiplicity, we find that (4) higher accuracy achieved through increased model
capacity reduces predictive multiplicity.
  Our findings underscore the clinical importance of accounting for model
multiplicity and advocate for ensemble-based strategies to improve diagnostic
reliability. In cases where models fail to reach sufficient consensus, we
recommend deferring decisions to expert review.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖名义资本规模或表面活动，导致风险分析不准确，需要更精细的动态评估。

Method: 利用链上事件日志和智能合约执行痕迹计算指数时间加权流动性（ETWL），并应用无监督异常检测，定义流动性稳定性影响分数（LSIS）。

Result: SILS能更准确地识别高影响力LPs，减少误报和漏报，提升DeFi生态系统的透明度和风险管理。

Conclusion: SILS为DeFi协议提供了主动风险管理机制，显著改善了流动性行为的评估和生态系统保护。

Abstract: Traditional methods for identifying impactful liquidity providers (LPs) in
Concentrated Liquidity Market Makers (CLMMs) rely on broad measures, such as
nominal capital size or surface-level activity, which often lead to inaccurate
risk analysis. The SILS framework offers a significantly more detailed
approach, characterizing LPs not just as capital holders but as dynamic
systemic agents whose actions directly impact market stability. This represents
a fundamental paradigm shift from the static, volume-based analysis to a
dynamic, impact-focused understanding. This advanced approach uses on-chain
event logs and smart contract execution traces to compute Exponential
Time-Weighted Liquidity (ETWL) profiles and apply unsupervised anomaly
detection. Most importantly, it defines an LP's functional importance through
the Liquidity Stability Impact Score (LSIS), a counterfactual metric that
measures the potential degradation of the market if the LP withdraws. This
combined approach provides a more detailed and realistic characterization of an
LP's impact, moving beyond the binary and often misleading classifications used
by existing methods. This impact-focused and comprehensive approach enables
SILS to accurately identify high-impact LPs-including those missed by
traditional methods and supports essential applications like a protective
oracle layer and actionable trader signals, thereby significantly enhancing
DeFi ecosystem. The framework provides unprecedented transparency into the
underlying liquidity structure and associated risks, effectively reducing the
common false positives and uncovering critical false negatives found in
traditional models. Therefore, SILS provides an effective mechanism for
proactive risk management, transforming how DeFi protocols safeguard their
ecosystems against asymmetric liquidity behavior.

Conclusion: 硬件对齐的注意力算术强度、MoE稀疏性和AFD是成本效益的关键，Step-3为LLM解码设定了新的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face low hardware efficiency during decoding,
especially for long-context reasoning tasks. This paper introduces Step-3, a
321B-parameter VLM with hardware-aware model-system co-design optimized for
minimizing decoding costs. Step-3 innovates in two key dimensions: (1) A novel
Multi-Matrix Factorization Attention (MFA) mechanism that significantly reduces
both KV cache size and computation while maintaining high attention
expressiveness, and (2) Attention-FFN Disaggregation (AFD), a distributed
inference system that decouples attention and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers
into specialized subsystems. This co-design achieves unprecedented cost
efficiency: Step-3 significantly reduces theoretical decoding costs compared
with models like DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B, with the gains widening at
longer context. Step-3 achieves low cost while activating 38B parameters per
token (more than DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3 MoE 235B), demonstrating that
hardware-aligned attention arithmetic intensity, MoE sparsity, and AFD are
critical to cost-effectiveness. We perform a head-to-head comparison with
DeepSeek-V3 in its favorable scenarios. Our implementation on Hopper GPUs
achieves a decoding throughput of up to 4,039 tokens per second per GPU under
50ms TPOT SLA (4K context, FP8, no MTP). It is higher than DeepSeek-V3's 2,324
in the same setup and sets a new Pareto frontier for LLM decoding.

Motivation: 研究如何在强化学习（RL）中捕捉潜在变化（上下文），以扩展代理的训练范围。

Method: 将上下文RL重新定义为双重推理-控制问题，提出观察充分性和控制充分性的理论框架，并设计了一个ELBO目标，通过BCPO算法实现。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，BCPO表现优于其他基线方法，样本效率更高，且在训练范围外仍保持性能。

Abstract: Capturing latent variations ("contexts") is key to deploying
reinforcement-learning (RL) agents beyond their training regime. We recast
context-based RL as a dual inference-control problem and formally characterize
two properties and their hierarchy: observation sufficiency (preserving all
predictive information) and control sufficiency (retaining decision-making
relevant information). Exploiting this dichotomy, we derive a contextual
evidence lower bound(ELBO)-style objective that cleanly separates
representation learning from policy learning and optimizes it with Bottlenecked
Contextual Policy Optimization (BCPO), an algorithm that places a variational
information-bottleneck encoder in front of any off-policy policy learner. On
standard continuous-control benchmarks with shifting physical parameters, BCPO
matches or surpasses other baselines while using fewer samples and retaining
performance far outside the training regime. The framework unifies theory,
diagnostics, and practice for context-based RL.

TL;DR: Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC) 是一种针对随机森林的模型解释方法，通过分组实例揭示局部和全局结构，提供可解释的聚类和特征重要性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感领域的应用增加，对可解释和可信决策的需求上升。随机森林虽性能强大，但其集成特性使其难以解释。

Method: FGC 通过分组实例的共享决策路径，生成与模型内部逻辑一致的可解释聚类，并计算特征重要性评分。

Result: FGC 在基准数据集上准确恢复潜在子类结构，优于传统聚类和后解释方法。在AML转录组数据中，FGC 发现了生物学相关的亚群和基因表达模式。

Conclusion: FGC 填补了性能与可解释性之间的鸿沟，提供了超越特征级归因的结构感知洞察。

Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in sensitive application
areas, the demand for interpretable and trustworthy decision-making has
increased. Random Forests (RF), despite their widespread use and strong
performance on tabular data, remain difficult to interpret due to their
ensemble nature. We present Forest-Guided Clustering (FGC), a model-specific
explainability method that reveals both local and global structure in RFs by
grouping instances according to shared decision paths. FGC produces
human-interpretable clusters aligned with the model's internal logic and
computes cluster-specific and global feature importance scores to derive
decision rules underlying RF predictions. FGC accurately recovered latent
subclass structure on a benchmark dataset and outperformed classical clustering
and post-hoc explanation methods. Applied to an AML transcriptomic dataset, FGC
uncovered biologically coherent subpopulations, disentangled disease-relevant
signals from confounders, and recovered known and novel gene expression
patterns. FGC bridges the gap between performance and interpretability by
providing structure-aware insights that go beyond feature-level attribution.

TL;DR: 近期研究表明，通过改进评估方法和强化学习，LLMs在事件预测方面逐渐接近超级预测者水平。本文提出大规模训练超级预测级事件预测LLMs的时机已成熟，并探讨了训练方法和数据获取两个关键方向。


<details>

Motivation: 基于近期技术进展，如推理模型和深度研究风格模型的成功，本文认为现在是研究大规模训练超级预测级事件预测LLMs的合适时机。

Method: 提出解决LLM事件预测训练的三大难点（噪声稀疏性、知识截止和简单奖励结构）的方法，包括假设事件贝叶斯网络、利用低召回和反事实事件及辅助奖励信号。

Result: 通过市场、公共和爬取数据集的积极使用，支持大规模训练和评估，有望实现AI在社会更广泛领域的预测智能。

Conclusion: 本文为接近超级预测级AI技术提供了具体路径和考虑，呼吁研究者关注这些方向。

Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast
doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved
evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching
superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been
reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success
of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that
technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been
developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the
time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training
methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three
difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,
knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present
related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,
utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward
signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling
datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how
these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to
society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths
and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,
aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

*Abhijan Theja,Mayukha Pal*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合MILP、合作博弈论和RL的动态公平能源分配框架，显著提升社区微电网的公平性和可持续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决社区微电网中静态优化方法无法适应动态不公平的问题，提升参与者的满意度和合作可持续性。

Method: 采用多目标MILP、合作博弈论和RL驱动的动态公平调整机制，结合EqWM原则和XAI。

Result: 验证显示峰值需求减少72.6%，Gini系数随时间降低，实现更公平的能源分配。

Conclusion: 该框架为可持续和公平的能源社区提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Fair and dynamic energy allocation in community microgrids remains a critical
challenge, particularly when serving socio-economically diverse participants.
Static optimization and cost-sharing methods often fail to adapt to evolving
inequities, leading to participant dissatisfaction and unsustainable
cooperation. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP), cooperative game
theory, and a dynamic equity-adjustment mechanism driven by reinforcement
learning (RL). At its core, the framework utilizes a bi-level optimization
model grounded in Equity-regarding Welfare Maximization (EqWM) principles,
which incorporate Rawlsian fairness to prioritize the welfare of the least
advantaged participants. We introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent that dynamically adjusts socio-economic weights in the optimization
objective based on observed inequities in cost and renewable energy access.
This RL-powered feedback loop enables the system to learn and adapt,
continuously striving for a more equitable state. To ensure transparency,
Explainable AI (XAI) is used to interpret the benefit allocations derived from
a weighted Shapley value. Validated across six realistic scenarios, the
framework demonstrates peak demand reductions of up to 72.6%, and significant
cooperative gains. The adaptive RL mechanism further reduces the Gini
coefficient over time, showcasing a pathway to truly sustainable and fair
energy communities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可扩展的方法，通过SOC依赖的充电功率约束近似CCCV行为，以解决传统微电网规划中忽略电池充电效率损失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微电网规划模型假设电池储能系统（BESS）为恒定功率充电，忽略了充电末期因内阻增加导致的效率损失，可能导致电池容量不足和可靠性问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于SOC依赖的充电功率约束（TCP）方法，近似模拟CCCV充电行为，并通过MATLAB验证其效果。

Result: 结果表明，在动态运行条件下，充电功率的调整显著影响BESS的容量、成本和可靠性。

Conclusion: 充电功率调整是长期微电网规划中准确模拟BESS性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Traditional long-term microgrid planning models assume constant power
charging for battery energy storage systems (BESS), overlooking efficiency
losses that occur toward the end of charge due to rising internal resistance.
While this issue can be mitigated at the cell level using constant
current-constant voltage (CCCV) charging, it is impractical at the pack level
in large-scale systems. However, battery management systems and inverter
controls can emulate this effect by tapering charging power at high
state-of-charge (SOC) levels, trading off charging speed for improved
efficiency and reduced thermal stress. Ignoring this behavior in planning
models can lead to undersized batteries and potential reliability issues. This
paper proposes a tractable and scalable approach to approximate CCCV behavior
using SOC-dependent tapered charging power (TCP) constraints. A MATLAB-based
proof of concept demonstrates the energy delivery and efficiency benefits of
tapering. The method is integrated into a long-term planning framework and
evaluated under a synthetic load and solar profile. Results show tapering
significantly affects BESS sizing, cost, and reliability under dynamic
operating conditions that demand fast charging. These findings highlight
tapering as a critical modeling factor for accurately capturing BESS
performance in long-term microgrid planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于互抗阻的控制屏障函数（RRCBF），用于增强受扰非线性系统的鲁棒性，无需明确知道扰动边界。通过引入互抗阻项，证明了其安全集的前向不变性和对扰动的鲁棒性，并进一步提出了基于扰动观测器的RRCBF（DO-RRCBF）以提升性能。

Conclusion: RRCBF和DO-RRCBF为受扰非线性系统提供了鲁棒的安全控制框架，无需扰动边界知识，且能恢复名义控制性能。

Abstract: In this note, a new reciprocal resistance-based control barrier function
(RRCBF) is developed to enhance the robustness of control barrier functions for
disturbed affine nonlinear systems, without requiring explicit knowledge of
disturbance bounds. By integrating a reciprocal resistance-like term into the
conventional zeroing barrier function framework, we formally establish the
concept of the reciprocal resistance-based barrier function (RRBF), rigorously
proving the forward invariance of its associated safe set and its robustness
against bounded disturbances. The RRBF inherently generates a buffer zone near
the boundary of the safe set, effectively dominating the influence of
uncertainties and external disturbances. This foundational concept is extended
to formulate RRCBFs, including their high-order variants. To alleviate
conservatism in the presence of complex, time-varying disturbances, we further
introduce a disturbance observer-based RRCBF (DO-RRCBF), which exploits
disturbance estimates to enhance safety guarantees and recover nominal control
performance. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through
two simulation studies: a second-order linear system illustrating forward
invariance in the phase plane, and an adaptive cruise control scenario
demonstrating robustness in systems with high relative degree.

Result: 仿真和实验表明，该方法能最小化覆盖成本，并在多无人机应用中有效跟踪时变化学羽流。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效且分布式，适用于多机器人时变覆盖控制问题，如羽流监测。

Abstract: In coverage control problems that involve time-varying density functions, the
coverage control law depends on spatial integrals of the time evolution of the
density function. The latter is often neglected, replaced with an upper bound
or calculated as a numerical approximation of the spatial integrals involved.
In this paper, we consider a special case of time-varying density functions
modeled as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) that evolve with time via a set of
time-varying sources (with known corresponding velocities). By imposing this
structure, we obtain an efficient time-varying coverage controller that fully
incorporates the time evolution of the density function. We show that the
induced trajectories under our control law minimise the overall coverage cost.
We elicit the structure of the proposed controller and compare it with a
classical time-varying coverage controller, against which we benchmark the
coverage performance in simulation. Furthermore, we highlight that the
computationally efficient and distributed nature of the proposed control law
makes it ideal for multi-vehicle robotic applications involving time-varying
coverage control problems. We employ our method in plume monitoring using a
swarm of drones. In an experimental field trial we show that drones guided by
the proposed controller are able to track a simulated time-varying chemical
plume in a distributed manner.

Abstract: Achieving high distribution-reliability levels and concurrently minimizing
operating costs can be considered as the main issues in distribution system
optimization. Determination of the optimal number and location of automation
devices in the distribution system network is an essential issue from the
reliability and economical points of view. To address these issues, this paper
develops a multi-objective model, wherein the primary objective, optimal
automation devices placement is implemented aiming at minimizing the operating
costs, while in the second objective the reliability indices improvement is
taken into account. So, modified non dominated sorting genetic algorithm, is
developed and presented to solve this multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear
programming problem. The feasibility of the proposed algorithm examined by
application to two distribution feeders of the Tabriz distribution network
containing the third feeder of the Azar substation with a distributed
generation unit and first and third feeders of ElGoli substation which form a
double feed feeder.

Motivation: 无人机中继网络的动态拓扑和与地面系统的干扰问题使得传统方法难以优化数据路由和资源分配。

Result: 单商品算法性能提升超过30 dB，多商品方法在密集场景中提升100倍，并通过数据分段实现额外20 dB增益。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著优于传统图方法，适用于延迟敏感和大数据传输场景。

Abstract: Dynamic low altitude networks offer significant potential for efficient and
reliable data transport via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) relays which
usually operate with predetermined trajectories. However, it is challenging to
optimize the data routing and resource allocation due to the time-varying
topology and the need to control interference with terrestrial systems.
Traditional schemes rely on time-expanded graphs with uniform and fine time
subdivisions, making them impractical for interference-aware applications. This
paper develops a dynamic space-time graph model with a cross-layer optimization
framework that converts a joint routing and predictive resource allocation
problem into a joint bottleneck path planning and resource allocation problem.
We develop explicit deterministic bounds to handle the channel uncertainty and
prove a monotonicity property in the problem structure that enables us to
efficiently reach the globally optimal solution to the predictive resource
allocation subproblem. Then, this approach is extended to multi-commodity
transmission tasks through time-frequency allocation, and a bisection search
algorithm is developed to find the optimum solution by leveraging the
monotonicity of the feasible set family. Simulations verify that the
single-commodity algorithm approaches global optimality with more than 30 dB
performance gain over the classical graph-based methods for delay-sensitive and
large data transportation. At the same time, the multi-commodity method
achieves 100X improvements in dense service scenarios and enables an additional
20 dB performance gain by data segmenting.

Abstract: Within Bayesian state estimation, considerable effort has been devoted to
incorporating constraints into state estimation for process optimization, state
monitoring, fault detection and control. Nonetheless, in the domain of
state-space system identification, the prevalent practice entails constructing
models under Gaussian noise assumptions, which can lead to inaccuracies when
the noise follows bounded distributions. With the aim of generalizing the
Gaussian noise assumption to potentially truncated densities, this paper
introduces a method for estimating the noise parameters in a state-space model
subject to truncated Gaussian noise. Our proposed data-driven approach is
rooted in maximum likelihood principles combined with the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm. The efficacy of the proposed approach is
supported by a simulation example.

Abstract: Power-electronics-based converters are being considerably employed through
the power system to interconnect multiple heterogeneous electrical layers.
Furthermore, the intrinsic versatility to play with the converter network
topology is widely exploited to accommodate a certain number of terminals and
ports according with the specific application. On this regard, several
converter arrangements can be encountered in power applications. Moreover, to
properly establish both the operation and the control, the so-called degrees of
freedom (DOFs) need to be assessed per each converter topology. On this matter,
similarly to the well-known Clarke transformation, which clearly reveals the
DOFs for the star-based topology system, further similar transformations can be
achieved to depict the independent set of variables characterizing a certain
converter structure. Referring to the cell-based class of Voltage Source
Converter (VSC) topologies, including Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC); this
article proposes a general methodology to determine the change of variable
matrix transformation for several converter arrangements which are related to
complete bi-partite and multi-partite graphs. The methodology lies in the graph
Laplacian spectral analysis, which remarks the structural normal modes at the
converter points of connections. Furthermore, for a complete characterization,
the instantaneous power patterns formulations, based on the DOFs, are also
introduced.

Abstract: In recent years, the frequent occurrence of disruptions has had a negative
impact on global supply chains. To stay competitive, enterprises strive to
remain agile through the implementation of efficient and effective
decision-making strategies in reaction to disruptions. A significant effort has
been made to develop these agile disruption mitigation approaches, leveraging
both centralized and distributed decision-making strategies. Though trade-offs
of centralized and distributed approaches have been analyzed in existing
studies, no related work has been found on understanding supply chain
performance based on the network attributes of the disrupted supply chain
entities. In this paper, we characterize supply chains from a capability and
network topological perspective and investigate the use of a distributed
decision-making approach based on classical multi-agent frameworks. The
performance of the distributed framework is evaluated through a comprehensive
case study that investigates the performance of the supply chain as a function
of the network structure and agent attributes within the network in the
presence of a disruption. Comparison to a centralized decision-making approach
highlights trade-offs between performance, computation time, and network
communication based on the decision-making strategy and network architecture.
Practitioners can use the outcomes of our studies to design response strategies
based on agent capabilities, network attributes, and desired supply chain
performance.

Motivation: COVID-19疫情导致制造环境高度动态化，传统资源分配方法难以应对机器故障等突发问题，需灵活且实时的决策策略。

Method: 提出基于模型的多智能体架构（RA），结合风险评估和聚类智能体协调策略，实现动态重调度。

Result: 仿真研究表明，该方法降低了计算复杂度，但牺牲了部分吞吐量最优性；风险评估的引入提升了吞吐量。

Conclusion: 多智能体框架和风险评估的结合为动态制造环境提供了有效的资源分配解决方案。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic brings many unexpected disruptions, such as frequently
shifting markets and limited human workforce, to manufacturers. To stay
competitive, flexible and real-time manufacturing decision-making strategies
are needed to deal with such highly dynamic manufacturing environments. One
essential problem is dynamic resource allocation to complete production tasks,
especially when a resource disruption (e.g., machine breakdown) occurs. Though
multi-agent methods have been proposed to solve the problem in a flexible and
agile manner, the agent internal decision-making process and resource
uncertainties have rarely been studied. This work introduces a model-based
resource agent (RA) architecture that enables effective agent coordination and
dynamic agent decision-making. Based on the RA architecture, a rescheduling
strategy that incorporates risk assessment via a clustering agent coordination
strategy is also proposed. A simulation-based case study is implemented to
demonstrate dynamic rescheduling using the proposed multi-agent framework. The
results show that the proposed method reduces the computational efforts while
losing some throughput optimality compared to the centralized method.
Furthermore, the case study illustrates that incorporating risk assessment into
rescheduling decision-making improves the throughput.

Conclusion: 该方法支持企业在随机环境中以分布式方式处理中断，适用于多代理控制与管理。

Abstract: In the highly complex and stochastic global, supply chain environments, local
enterprise agents seek distributed and dynamic strategies for agile responses
to disruptions. Existing literature explores both centralized and distributed
approaches, while most work neglects temporal dynamics and the heterogeneity of
the risk management of individual agents. To address this gap, this letter
presents a heterogeneous risk management mechanism to incorporate uncertainties
and risk attitudes into agent communication and decision-making strategy.
Hence, this approach empowers enterprises to handle disruptions in stochastic
environments in a distributed way, and in particular in the context of
multi-agent control and management. Through a simulated case study, we showcase
the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach under stochastic
settings and how the decision of disruption responses changes when agents hold
various risk attitudes.

Conclusion: Perpetua是一种高效、可扩展且通用的方法，适用于动态环境中的特征状态预测。

Abstract: Many robotic systems require extended deployments in complex, dynamic
environments. In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between
subsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling
algorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables
predicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state
observations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This
paper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static
features. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics
of the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to
enable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together
mixtures of "persistence" and "emergence" filters to model the probability that
features will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The
approach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating
the states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at
arbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,
we find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also
being online adaptable and robust to missing observations.

Abstract: Constraint-based optimization is a cornerstone of robotics, enabling the
design of controllers that reliably encode task and safety requirements such as
collision avoidance or formation adherence. However, handcrafted constraints
can fail in multi-agent settings that demand complex coordination. We introduce
ReCoDe--Reinforcement-based Constraint Design--a decentralized, hybrid
framework that merges the reliability of optimization-based controllers with
the adaptability of multi-agent reinforcement learning. Rather than discarding
expert controllers, ReCoDe improves them by learning additional, dynamic
constraints that capture subtler behaviors, for example, by constraining agent
movements to prevent congestion in cluttered scenarios. Through local
communication, agents collectively constrain their allowed actions to
coordinate more effectively under changing conditions. In this work, we focus
on applications of ReCoDe to multi-agent navigation tasks requiring intricate,
context-based movements and consensus, where we show that it outperforms purely
handcrafted controllers, other hybrid approaches, and standard MARL baselines.
We give empirical (real robot) and theoretical evidence that retaining a
user-defined controller, even when it is imperfect, is more efficient than
learning from scratch, especially because ReCoDe can dynamically change the
degree to which it relies on this controller.

*Trent Weiss,Madhur Behl*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Gauss-Legendre Rectangle (GLR)的算法，用于高速自动驾驶赛车中的碰撞风险实时估计，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞风险估计方法在高速赛车场景中过于简化或保守，无法满足精确性和实时性需求。

Method: GLR算法结合Gauss-Legendre积分和非齐次泊松过程，分两阶段估计碰撞风险，考虑车辆几何和轨迹不确定性。

Result: 在446个超车场景的实验中，GLR平均误差降低77%，优于其他五种方法，且运行频率达1000 Hz。

Conclusion: GLR算法在高速赛车中表现优异，且适用于更广泛的运动规划场景。

Abstract: Overtaking in high-speed autonomous racing demands precise, real-time
estimation of collision risk; particularly in wheel-to-wheel scenarios where
safety margins are minimal. Existing methods for collision risk estimation
either rely on simplified geometric approximations, like bounding circles, or
perform Monte Carlo sampling which leads to overly conservative motion planning
behavior at racing speeds. We introduce the Gauss-Legendre Rectangle (GLR)
algorithm, a principled two-stage integration method that estimates collision
risk by combining Gauss-Legendre with a non-homogeneous Poisson process over
time. GLR produces accurate risk estimates that account for vehicle geometry
and trajectory uncertainty. In experiments across 446 overtaking scenarios in a
high-fidelity Formula One racing simulation, GLR outperforms five
state-of-the-art baselines achieving an average error reduction of 77% and
surpassing the next-best method by 52%, all while running at 1000 Hz. The
framework is general and applicable to broader motion planning contexts beyond
autonomous racing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人外观分类方法过于宽泛或局限于拟人化特征，无法全面分类所有类型机器人，限制了设计与交互效果的研究。

Method: 采用元建模方法，基于IEEE Robots Guide中的222个机器人，构建MetaMorph框架，系统化比较视觉特征。

Result: MetaMorph框架能够量化机器人间的视觉差异，并探索适合不同任务和场景的设计特征。

Conclusion: MetaMorph为机器人形态分类提供了更精确的工具，有助于优化设计与交互效果的研究。

Abstract: Robot appearance crucially shapes Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) but is
typically described via broad categories like anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, or
technical. More precise approaches focus almost exclusively on anthropomorphic
features, which fail to classify robots across all types, limiting the ability
to draw meaningful connections between robot design and its effect on
interaction. In response, we present MetaMorph, a comprehensive framework for
classifying robot morphology. Using a metamodeling approach, MetaMorph was
synthesized from 222 robots in the IEEE Robots Guide, offering a structured
method for comparing visual features. This model allows researchers to assess
the visual distances between robot models and explore optimal design traits
tailored to different tasks and contexts.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的体积抓取模型，具有垂直轴旋转等变性，显著提高样本效率。采用三平面体积特征表示，结合可变形可转向卷积，实现局部几何适应性与等变性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在效率和性能上均有显著提升。

Abstract: We propose a new volumetric grasp model that is equivariant to rotations
around the vertical axis, leading to a significant improvement in sample
efficiency. Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation --
i.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a
novel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are
equivariant to 90{\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two
planes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by
a new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of
deformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones.
This allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while
preserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations
of two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically,
we derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism
and propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow
matching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed
equivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated
and real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed
projection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory
costs. Moreover, the equivariant grasp models built on top of our tri-plane
features consistently outperform their non-equivariant counterparts, achieving
higher performance with only a modest computational overhead. Video and code

Result: 在低端i5 CPU上实现71Hz性能，在低纹理环境中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了计算效率和低纹理环境下的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for efficiently estimating the
6-Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) robot pose with a decoupled, non-iterative method
that capitalizes on overlapping planar elements. Conventional RGB-D visual
odometry(RGBD-VO) often relies on iterative optimization solvers to estimate
pose and involves a process of feature extraction and matching. This results in
significant computational burden and time delays. To address this, our
innovative method for RGBD-VO separates the estimation of rotation and
translation. Initially, we exploit the overlaid planar characteristics within
the scene to calculate the rotation matrix. Following this, we utilize a kernel
cross-correlator (KCC) to ascertain the translation. By sidestepping the
resource-intensive iterative optimization and feature extraction and alignment
procedures, our methodology offers improved computational efficacy, achieving a
performance of 71Hz on a lower-end i5 CPU. When the RGBD-VO does not rely on
feature points, our technique exhibits enhanced performance in low-texture
degenerative environments compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Recent progress in robot autonomy and safety has significantly improved
human-robot interactions, enabling robots to work alongside humans on various
tasks. However, complex assembly tasks still present significant challenges due
to inherent task variability and the need for precise operations. This work
explores deploying robots in an assistive role for such tasks, where the robot
assists by fetching parts while the skilled worker provides high-level guidance
and performs the assembly. We introduce GEAR, a gaze-enabled system designed to
enhance human-robot collaboration by allowing robots to respond to the user's
gaze. We evaluate GEAR against a touch-based interface where users interact
with the robot through a touchscreen. The experimental study involved 30
participants working on two distinct assembly scenarios of varying complexity.
Results demonstrated that GEAR enabled participants to accomplish the assembly
with reduced physical demand and effort compared to the touchscreen interface,
especially for complex tasks, maintaining great performance, and receiving
objects effectively. Participants also reported enhanced user experience while
performing assembly tasks. Project page: sites.google.com/view/gear-hri

Main category: cs.RO

<details>

Motivation: 柔性关节机器人的运动控制因关节弹性和系统动态变化而受限，传统的DOB设计保守且性能不足。

Method: 采用FRF优化方法，最大化控制带宽并抑制振动，同时通过Nyquist稳定性准则确保闭环稳定性。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法显著提升了系统的鲁棒性和运动性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了柔性关节机器人中DOB性能受限的问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Motion control of flexible joint robots (FJR) is challenged by inherent
flexibility and configuration-dependent variations in system dynamics. While
disturbance observers (DOB) can enhance system robustness, their performance is
often limited by the elasticity of the joints and the variations in system
parameters, which leads to a conservative design of the DOB. This paper
presents a novel frequency response function (FRF)-based optimization method
aimed at improving DOB performance, even in the presence of flexibility and
system variability. The proposed method maximizes control bandwidth and
effectively suppresses vibrations, thus enhancing overall system performance.
Closed-loop stability is rigorously proven using the Nyquist stability
criterion. Experimental validation on a FJR demonstrates that the proposed
approach significantly improves robustness and motion performance, even under
conditions of joint flexibility and system variation.

Abstract: High-precision navigation and positioning systems are critical for
applications in autonomous vehicles and mobile mapping, where robust and
continuous localization is essential. To test and enhance the performance of
algorithms, some research institutions and companies have successively
constructed and publicly released datasets. However, existing datasets still
suffer from limitations in sensor diversity and environmental coverage. To
address these shortcomings and advance development in related fields, the
SmartPNT Multisource Integrated Navigation, Positioning, and Attitude Dataset
has been developed. This dataset integrates data from multiple sensors,
including Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Measurement
Units (IMU), optical cameras, and LiDAR, to provide a rich and versatile
resource for research in multi-sensor fusion and high-precision navigation. The
dataset construction process is thoroughly documented, encompassing sensor
configurations, coordinate system definitions, and calibration procedures for
both cameras and LiDAR. A standardized framework for data collection and
processing ensures consistency and scalability, enabling large-scale analysis.
Validation using state-of-the-art Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
algorithms, such as VINS-Mono and LIO-SAM, demonstrates the dataset's
applicability for advanced navigation research. Covering a wide range of
real-world scenarios, including urban areas, campuses, tunnels, and suburban
environments, the dataset offers a valuable tool for advancing navigation
technologies and addressing challenges in complex environments. By providing a
publicly accessible, high-quality dataset, this work aims to bridge gaps in
sensor diversity, data accessibility, and environmental representation,
fostering further innovation in the field.

Abstract: This study explores which factors of the visual design of a robot may
influence how humans would place it in a collaborative cooking scenario and how
these features may influence task delegation. Human participants were placed in
a Virtual Reality (VR) environment and asked to set up a kitchen for cooking
alongside a robot companion while considering the robot's morphology. We
collected multimodal data for the arrangements created by the participants,
transcripts of their think-aloud as they were performing the task, and
transcripts of their answers to structured post-task questionnaires. Based on
analyzing this data, we formulate several hypotheses: humans prefer to
collaborate with biomorphic robots; human beliefs about the sensory
capabilities of robots are less influenced by the morphology of the robot than
beliefs about action capabilities; and humans will implement fewer avoidance
strategies when sharing space with gracile robots. We intend to verify these
hypotheses in follow-up studies.

Abstract: Localization of mobile robots is crucial for deploying robots in real-world
applications such as search and rescue missions. This work aims to develop an
accurate localization system applicable to swarm robots equipped only with
low-cost monocular vision sensors and visual markers. The system is designed to
operate in fully open spaces, without landmarks or support from positioning
infrastructures. To achieve this, we propose a localization method based on
equilateral triangular formations. By leveraging the geometric properties of
equilateral triangles, the accurate two-dimensional position of each
participating robot is estimated using one-dimensional lateral distance
information between robots, which can be reliably and accurately obtained with
a low-cost monocular vision sensor. Experimental and simulation results
demonstrate that, as travel time increases, the positioning error of the
proposed method becomes significantly smaller than that of a conventional
dead-reckoning system, another low-cost localization approach applicable to
open environments.

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces challenges in navigating complex real-world traffic,
requiring safe handling of both common and critical scenarios. Reinforcement
learning (RL), a prominent method in end-to-end driving, enables agents to
learn through trial and error in simulation. However, RL training often relies
on rule-based traffic scenarios, limiting generalization. Additionally, current
scenario generation methods focus heavily on critical scenarios, neglecting a
balance with routine driving behaviors. Curriculum learning, which
progressively trains agents on increasingly complex tasks, is a promising
approach to improving the robustness and coverage of RL driving policies.
However, existing research mainly emphasizes manually designed curricula,
focusing on scenery and actor placement rather than traffic behavior dynamics.
This work introduces a novel student-teacher framework for automatic curriculum
learning. The teacher, a graph-based multi-agent RL component, adaptively
generates traffic behaviors across diverse difficulty levels. An adaptive
mechanism adjusts task difficulty based on student performance, ensuring
exposure to behaviors ranging from common to critical. The student, though
exchangeable, is realized as a deep RL agent with partial observability,
reflecting real-world perception constraints. Results demonstrate the teacher's
ability to generate diverse traffic behaviors. The student, trained with
automatic curricula, outperformed agents trained on rule-based traffic,
achieving higher rewards and exhibiting balanced, assertive driving.

Result: 视觉语言模型能够为社交机器人提供足够通用的多模态处理能力。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型是提升社交机器人多模态交互能力的可行方案，但仍需解决技术挑战。

Abstract: Large language models have given social robots the ability to autonomously
engage in open-domain conversations. However, they are still missing a
fundamental social skill: making use of the multiple modalities that carry
social interactions. While previous work has focused on task-oriented
interactions that require referencing the environment or specific phenomena in
social interactions such as dialogue breakdowns, we outline the overall needs
of a multimodal system for social conversations with robots. We then argue that
vision-language models are able to process this wide range of visual
information in a sufficiently general manner for autonomous social robots. We
describe how to adapt them to this setting, which technical challenges remain,
and briefly discuss evaluation practices.

Abstract: This study presents a grasping method for objects with uneven mass
distribution by leveraging diffusion models to localize the center of gravity
(CoG) on unknown objects. In robotic grasping, CoG deviation often leads to
postural instability, where existing keypoint-based or affordance-driven
methods exhibit limitations. We constructed a dataset of 790 images featuring
unevenly distributed objects with keypoint annotations for CoG localization. A
vision-driven framework based on foundation models was developed to achieve
CoG-aware grasping. Experimental evaluations across real-world scenarios
demonstrate that our method achieves a 49\% higher success rate compared to
conventional keypoint-based approaches and an 11\% improvement over
state-of-the-art affordance-driven methods. The system exhibits strong
generalization with a 76\% CoG localization accuracy on unseen objects,
providing a novel solution for precise and stable grasping tasks.

Motivation: 探索不可分割杂务分配中满足EFX及其近似解的存在性，以提升公平性。

Method: 通过初始EF1和PO分配，进行局部交换操作，构建通用框架以实现近似-EFX分配。

Result: 证明了在所有加法负效用实例中存在2-EFX分配，并统一了现有结果。

Conclusion: 提出的框架因其简洁性和通用性，有望在近似-EFX研究中广泛应用。

Abstract: We study the fair division of indivisible chores among agents with additive
disutility functions. We investigate the existence of allocations satisfying
the popular fairness notion of envy-freeness up to any chore (EFX), and its
multiplicative approximations. The existence of $4$-EFX allocations was
recently established by Garg, Murhekar, and Qin (2025). We improve this
guarantee by proving the existence of $2$-EFX allocations for all instances
with additive disutilities. This approximation was previously known only for
restricted instances such as bivalued disutilities (Lin, Wu, and Zhou (2025))
or three agents (Afshinmehr, Ansaripour, Danaei, and Mehlhorn (2024)).
  We obtain our result by providing a general framework for achieving
approximate-EFX allocations. The approach begins with a suitable initial
allocation and performs a sequence of local swaps between the bundles of
envious and envied agents. For our main result, we begin with an initial
allocation that satisfies envy-freeness up to one chore (EF1) and
Pareto-optimality (PO); the existence of such an allocation was recently
established in a major breakthrough by Mahara (2025). We further demonstrate
the strength and generality of our framework by giving simple and unified
proofs of existing results, namely (i) $2$-EFX for bivalued instances, (ii)
2-EFX for three agents, (iii) EFX when the number of chores is at most twice
the number of agents, and (iv) $4$-EFX for all instances. We expect this
framework to have broader applications in approximate-EFX due to its simplicity
and generality.

Abstract: Understanding how novices acquire and hone visual search skills is crucial
for developing and optimizing training methods across domains. Network analysis
methods can be used to analyze graph representations of visual expertise. This
study investigates the relationship between eye-gaze movements and learning
outcomes among undergraduate dentistry students who were diagnosing dental
radiographs over multiple semesters. We use network analysis techniques to
model eye-gaze scanpaths as directed graphs and examine changes in network
metrics over time. Using time series clustering on each metric, we identify
distinct patterns of visual search strategies and explore their association
with students' diagnostic performance. Our findings suggest that the network
metric of transition entropy is negatively correlated with performance scores,
while the number of nodes and edges as well as average PageRank are positively
correlated with performance scores. Changes in network metrics for individual
students over time suggest a developmental shift from intermediate to
expert-level processing. These insights contribute to understanding expertise
acquisition in visual tasks and can inform the design of AI-assisted learning
interventions.

trust are paramount. To explore how interacting with an LLM instead of a human
might shift cooperative behavior in such settings, we used the Prisoner's
Dilemma game -- a surrogate of several real-world managerial and economic
scenarios. In Experiment 1 (N=100), participants engaged in a thirty-round
repeated game against a human, a classic bot, and an LLM (GPT, in real-time).
In Experiment 2 (N=192), participants played a one-shot game against a human or
an LLM, with half of them allowed to communicate with their opponent, enabling
LLMs to leverage a key advantage over older-generation machines. Cooperation
rates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points
compared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This
finding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost
of selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about
cooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the
likelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is
particularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the
assumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines
compared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher
following prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in
cooperative behavior. Our findings validate the (careful) use of LLMs by
businesses in settings that have a cooperative component.

TL;DR: 人类区分真实与AI生成图像的能力有限，成功率仅62%，尤其在自然和城市景观中表现较差，需透明工具应对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类是否能有效区分真实与AI生成的图像，以应对AI生成内容可能带来的虚假信息风险。

Method: 通过在线游戏收集数据，参与者评估随机展示的真实与AI生成图像，分析约287,000次评估结果。

Result: 整体成功率62%，肖像识别较准，自然和城市景观识别困难。

Conclusion: 人类难以区分AI生成图像，需开发透明工具（如水印和检测工具）以减少虚假信息风险。

Abstract: As AI-powered image generation improves, a key question is how well human
beings can differentiate between "real" and AI-generated or modified images.
Using data collected from the online game "Real or Not Quiz.", this study
investigates how effectively people can distinguish AI-generated images from
real ones. Participants viewed a randomized set of real and AI-generated
images, aiming to identify their authenticity. Analysis of approximately
287,000 image evaluations by over 12,500 global participants revealed an
overall success rate of only 62\%, indicating a modest ability, slightly above
chance. Participants were most accurate with human portraits but struggled
significantly with natural and urban landscapes. These results highlight the
inherent challenge humans face in distinguishing AI-generated visual content,
particularly images without obvious artifacts or stylistic cues. This study
stresses the need for transparency tools, such as watermarks and robust AI
detection tools to mitigate the risks of misinformation arising from
AI-generated content

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类与AI在视觉叙事任务中的表现差异，以了解各自的长处与局限。

Method: 通过让人类参与者与AI系统分别根据指令重现Nancy漫画的三格漫画，比较其表现。

Result: AI在模仿艺术方面表现优异，但在故事连贯性上不足；人类则能有效将指令转化为有意义的视觉叙事。

Conclusion: 人类在视觉叙事任务中更具优势，而AI目前更适合艺术模仿而非故事创作。

Abstract: This article presents a case study comparing the capabilities of humans and
artificial intelligence (AI) for visual storytelling. We developed detailed
instructions to recreate a three-panel Nancy cartoon strip by Ernie Bushmiller
and provided them to both humans and AI systems. The human participants were
20-something students with basic artistic training but no experience or
knowledge of this comic strip. The AI systems used were popular commercial
models trained to draw and paint like artists, though their training sets may
not necessarily include Bushmiller's work. Results showed that AI systems excel
at mimicking professional art but struggle to create coherent visual stories.
In contrast, humans proved highly adept at transforming instructions into
meaningful visual narratives.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种分解原则和用户界面DxHF，通过将长文本分解为单个主张来改进人类反馈质量，提升LLM对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前用户界面要求标注者比较长文本段落，认知负担重，尤其对长或不熟悉文本。

Method: 提出分解原则，构建DxHF界面，分解文本为单个主张，视觉编码相关性并链接相似主张。

Result: DxHF平均提高反馈准确率5%，但增加反馈时间18秒；对不确定用户效果更显著。

Conclusion: 分解原则和DxHF界面有效提升人类反馈质量，HCI方法对改进人类-AI对齐有潜力。

Abstract: Human preferences are widely used to align large language models (LLMs)
through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF).
However, the current user interfaces require annotators to compare text
paragraphs, which is cognitively challenging when the texts are long or
unfamiliar. This paper contributes by studying the decomposition principle as
an approach to improving the quality of human feedback for LLM alignment. This
approach breaks down the text into individual claims instead of directly
comparing two long-form text responses. Based on the principle, we build a
novel user interface DxHF. It enhances the comparison process by showing
decomposed claims, visually encoding the relevance of claims to the
conversation and linking similar claims. This allows users to skim through key
information and identify differences for better and quicker judgment. Our
technical evaluation shows evidence that decomposition generally improves
feedback accuracy regarding the ground truth, particularly for users with
uncertainty. A crowdsourcing study with 160 participants indicates that using
DxHF improves feedback accuracy by an average of 5%, although it increases the
average feedback time by 18 seconds. Notably, accuracy is significantly higher
in situations where users have less certainty. The finding of the study
highlights the potential of HCI as an effective method for improving human-AI
alignment.

Abstract: Social VR introduces new ethical challenges for observational research. The
current paper presents a narrative literature review of ethical considerations
in observational methods, with a focus on work in HCI. We examine how
unobtrusive or selectively disclosed observation is implemented in public
face-to-face and social VR settings. Our review extends ethical discussions
from traditional public research into the context of social VR, highlighting
tensions between observer visibility, data traceability, and participant
autonomy. Drawing on insights distilled from prior literature, we propose five
constructive guidelines for ethical observational research in public social VR
environments. Our work offers key implications for future research, addressing
anticipated improvements in platform design, the management of researcher
presence, and the development of community-informed consent mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆决策中的不确定性很少传达给行人，影响透明度和信任。

Method: 采用VR实验（N=26），比较显式（信心百分比）和隐式（车辆运动）沟通方式在不同信心水平下的效果。

Result: 显式沟通在传达不确定性、提升安全感和信任方面更有效；隐式沟通在信心低时易引发歧义。

Conclusion: 研究为AV外部界面设计提供了指导，强调不确定性传达的重要性。

Abstract: Uncertainty is an inherent aspect of autonomous vehicle (AV) decision-making,
yet it is rarely communicated to pedestrians, which hinders transparency. This
study investigates how AV uncertainty can be conveyed through two approaches:
explicit communication (confidence percentage displays) and implicit
communication (vehicle motion cues), across different confidence levels (high
and low). Through a within-subject VR experiment (N=26), we evaluated these
approaches in a crossing scenario, assessing interface qualities (visibility
and intuitiveness), how well the information conveyed the vehicle's level of
confidence, and their impact on participants' perceived safety, trust, and user
experience. Our results show that explicit communication is more effective and
preferred for conveying uncertainty, enhancing safety, trust, and user
experience. Conversely, implicit communication introduces ambiguity, especially
when AV confidence is low. This research provides empirical insights into how
uncertainty communication shapes pedestrian interpretation of AV behaviour and
offer design guidance for external interfaces that integrate uncertainty as a
communicative element.

them to maintain situation awareness inside the vehicle is a challenge. This
paper presents two of our participatory design workshops that explored what
information BVIPs need in HAVs and what an interface that meets these needs
might look like. Based on the participants' insights, we created final systems
to improve their situation awareness. The two workshops used different
approaches: in the first, participants built their own low-fidelity prototypes;
in the second, they evaluated and discussed the initial prototypes we provided.
We will outline how each workshop was set up and share lessons learned about
prototyping methods for BVIPs and how they could be improved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据可视化方法假设决策者是理性的，而忽视了心理距离（如时空、社会身份等）对认知的影响。气候变化政策需要更紧迫的转变，因此需设计更直观的数据呈现方式。

Method: 通过文献综述和综合，将心理距离与推测性设计和数据情感化结合，展示情感设计方法的价值。

Result: 提出了一种新的环境数据沟通和可视化前提，强调替代设计方法能减少心理距离，使数据更直观。

Conclusion: 未来研究应探索替代设计方法如何进一步降低心理距离，提升政策决策数据的可感知性。

Abstract: Policy decisions relevant to the environment rely on tools like dashboards,
risk models, and prediction models to provide information and data
visualizations that enable decision-makers to make trade-offs. The conventional
paradigm of data visualization practices for policy and decision-making is to
convey data in a supposedly neutral, objective manner for rational
decision-makers. Feminist critique advocates for nuanced and reflexive
approaches that take into account situated decision-makers and their affective
relationships to data. This paper sheds light on a key cognitive aspect that
impacts how decision-makers interpret data. Because all outcomes from policies
relevant to climate change occur at a distance, decision-makers experience
so-called `psychological distance' to environmental decisions in terms of
space, time, social identity, and hypotheticality. This profoundly impacts how
they perceive and evaluate outcomes. Since policy decisions to achieve a safe
planetary space are urgently needed for immediate transition and change, we
need a design practice that takes into account how psychological distance
affects cognition and decision-making. Our paper explores the role of
alternative design approaches in developing visualizations used for climate
policymaking. We conduct a literature review and synthesis which bridges
psychological distance with speculative design and data visceralization by
illustrating the value of affective design methods via examples from previous
research. Through this work, we propose a novel premise for the communication
and visualization of environmental data. Our paper lays out how future research
on the impacts of alternative design approaches on psychological distance can
make data used for policy decisions more tangible and visceral.

Method: TreeReader将论文分解为树状结构，每部分由LLM生成摘要，细节按需展开。

Result: 用户研究表明，TreeReader提高了阅读效率和理解能力。

Conclusion: TreeReader通过分层摘要与交互探索结合，为学术文献阅读提供了更高效的方式。

Abstract: Efficiently navigating and understanding academic papers is crucial for
scientific progress. Traditional linear formats like PDF and HTML can cause
cognitive overload and obscure a paper's hierarchical structure, making it
difficult to locate key information. While LLM-based chatbots offer
summarization, they often lack nuanced understanding of specific sections, may
produce unreliable information, and typically discard the document's
navigational structure. Drawing insights from a formative study on academic
reading practices, we introduce TreeReader, a novel language model-augmented
paper reader. TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree structure
where each section is initially represented by an LLM-generated concise
summary, with underlying details accessible on demand. This design allows users
to quickly grasp core ideas, selectively explore sections of interest, and
verify summaries against the source text. A user study was conducted to
evaluate TreeReader's impact on reading efficiency and comprehension.
TreeReader provides a more focused and efficient way to navigate and understand
complex academic literature by bridging hierarchical summarization with
interactive exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据集搜索在数据科学中至关重要，但现有工具限制多，用户难以表达隐式偏好和了解搜索空间。

Method: DataScout提供AI辅助查询重构、语义搜索和过滤、动态数据集相关性指标。

Result: 用户研究表明，DataScout不仅支持结构化探索，还帮助用户理解查询反馈和搜索空间。

Conclusion: DataScout通过创新功能显著提升了数据集搜索的效率和用户体验。

Abstract: Dataset Search -- the process of finding appropriate datasets for a given
task -- remains a critical yet under-explored challenge in data science
workflows. Assessing dataset suitability for a task (e.g., training a
classification model) is a multi-pronged affair that involves understanding:
data characteristics (e.g. granularity, attributes, size), semantics (e.g.,
data semantics, creation goals), and relevance to the task at hand. Present-day
dataset search interfaces are restrictive -- users struggle to convey implicit
preferences and lack visibility into the search space and result inclusion
criteria -- making query iteration challenging. To bridge these gaps, we
introduce DataScout to proactively steer users through the process of dataset
discovery via -- (i) AI-assisted query reformulations informed by the
underlying search space, (ii) semantic search and filtering based on dataset
content, including attributes (columns) and granularity (rows), and (iii)
dataset relevance indicators, generated dynamically based on the user-specified
task. A within-subjects study with 12 participants comparing DataScout to
keyword and semantic dataset search reveals that users uniquely employ
DataScout's features not only for structured explorations, but also to glean
feedback on their search queries and build conceptual models of the search
space.

Motivation: 英语语音节奏对ESL学习者至关重要，但传统模仿训练依赖外部反馈，限制了独立练习。

Method: 系统通过配音练习，结合视觉辅助设计（同步听、引导重复、比较反思）自动提取节奏。

Result: 用户研究表明，RhythmTA显著提升了学习者的节奏感知能力，并有望改善节奏产出。

Conclusion: RhythmTA为ESL学习者提供了一种有效的独立练习工具，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: English speech rhythm, the temporal patterns of stressed syllables, is
essential for English as a second language (ESL) learners to produce
natural-sounding and comprehensible speech. Rhythm training is generally based
on imitation of native speech. However, it relies heavily on external
instructor feedback, preventing ESL learners from independent practice. To
address this gap, we present RhythmTA, an interactive system for ESL learners
to practice speech rhythm independently via dubbing, an imitation-based
approach. The system automatically extracts rhythm from any English speech and
introduces novel visual designs to support three stages of dubbing practice:
(1) Synchronized listening with visual aids to enhance perception, (2) Guided
repeating by visual cues for self-adjustment, and (3) Comparative reflection
from a parallel view for self-monitoring. Our design is informed by a formative
study with nine spoken English instructors, which identified current practices
and challenges. A user study with twelve ESL learners demonstrates that
RhythmTA effectively enhances learners' rhythm perception and shows significant
potential for improving rhythm production.

build worlds through our practice that can become future realities? This paper
introduces the fictional consultancy ANCSTRL.LAB to explore opportunities for
making space in research projects that can encourage more systems-oriented
interventions. We present a design fiction that asks `what if energy management
and reduction practice embraced systems thinking?'. Our design fiction explores
how future energy consultancies could utilise systems thinking, and (more than)
human centred design to re-imagine energy management practice and change
systems in ways that are currently unfathomable. We finish by discussing how
LIMITS research can utilise design fiction and speculative praxis to help build
new material realities where more holistic perspectives, the leveraging of
systems change, and the imagining of post-neoliberal futures is the norm.

Abstract: Designing for sufficiency is one of many approaches that could foster more
moderate and sustainable digital practices. Based on the Sustainable
Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) literature, we identify five environmental settings categories. However,
our analysis of three mobile OS and nine representative applications shows an
overall lack of environmental concerns in settings design, leading us to
identify six pervasive anti-patterns. Environmental settings, where they exist,
are set on the most intensive option by default. They are not presented as
such, are not easily accessible, and offer little explanation of their impact.
Instead, they encourage more intensive use. Based on these findings, we create
a design workbook that explores design principles for environmental settings:
presenting the environmental potential of settings; shifting to environmentally
neutral states; previewing effects to encourage moderate use; rethinking
defaults; facilitating settings access and; exploring more frugal settings.
Building upon this workbook, we discuss how settings can tie individual
behaviors to systemic factors.

structured hand-eye coordination exercises. A six-week pre-test/post-test study
was conducted with 16 children in Ecuador, using standardized assessments, the
Toulouse-Pieron Cancellation Test, and the Moss Attention Rating Scale
complemented by detailed observational metrics. Quantitative results indicate
statistically significant improvements in concentration scores, with test
scores increasing from 65.2 to 80.3 and 55.4 to 68.7, respectively (p < 0.01).
Qualitative observations revealed reduced task attempts, enhanced user
confidence, and increased active participation. The inclusion of a VR assistant
provided consistent guidance that further boosted engagement. These findings
demonstrate the potential of immersive, game-based learning environments as
practical therapeutic tools, laying a robust foundation for developing
inclusive and adaptive rehabilitation strategies for children with ID.

Abstract: A central area of interest in many competitive online games is spatial
behavior which due to its complexity can be difficult to visualize. Such
behaviors of interest include not only overall movement patterns but also being
able to understand which player or team is exerting control over an area to
inform decision-making. Map control can, however, be challenging to quantify.
In this paper, we propose a method for calculating frontlines and first efforts
towards a visualization of them. The visualization can show map control and
frontlines at a specific time point or changes of these over time. For this
purpose, it utilizes support vector machines to derive frontlines from unit
positions. We illustrate our algorithm and visualization with examples based on
the team-based online game World of Tanks.

Motivation: 研究数字技术如何帮助更精确地研究和重现文化遗产，尤其是当仅存遗迹时。

Method: 利用VR和XR技术，结合激光扫描和摄影测量等方法，创建沉浸式互动体验。

Result: 能够以沉浸式方式重现和体验文化遗产的原始复杂性，但跨学科合作和公众传播仍具挑战。

Conclusion: VR和XR为文化遗产研究提供了新工具，但需解决跨学科协作和普及问题。

Abstract: Digital technologies and tools have transformed the way we can study cultural
heritage and the way we can recreate it digitally. Techniques such as laser
scanning, photogrammetry, and a variety of Mixed Reality solutions have enabled
researchers to examine cultural objects and artifacts more precisely and from
new perspectives. In this part of the panel, we explore how Virtual Reality
(VR) and eXtended Reality (XR) can serve as tools to recreate and visualize the
remains of historical cultural heritage and experience it in simulations of its
original complexity, which means immersive and interactive. Visualization of
material culture exemplified by archaeological sites and architecture can be
particularly useful when only ruins or archaeological remains survive. However,
these advancements also bring significant challenges, especially in the area of
transdisciplinary cooperation between specialists from many, often distant,
fields, and the dissemination of virtual immersive environments among both
professionals and the general public.

Result: MR技术在医疗教育、手术、康复和心理健康中表现优异，但需解决高成本和触觉反馈不足等问题。

Conclusion: 未来通过整合XR、AI等新技术，可进一步提升MR在医疗中的效果和普及性。

Abstract: Mixed Reality (MR) technologies such as Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR,
AR) are well established in medical practice, enhancing diagnostics, treatment,
and education. However, there are still some limitations and challenges that
may be overcome thanks to the latest generations of equipment, software, and
frameworks based on eXtended Reality (XR) by enabling immersive systems that
support safer, more controlled environments for training and patient care. Our
review highlights recent VR and AR applications in key areas of medicine. In
medical education, these technologies provide realistic clinical simulations,
improving skills and knowledge retention. In surgery, immersive tools enhance
procedural precision with detailed anatomical visualizations. VR-based
rehabilitation has shown effectiveness in restoring motor functions and
balance, particularly for neurological patients. In mental health, VR has been
successful in treating conditions like PTSD and phobias. Although VR and AR
solutions are well established, there are still some important limitations,
including high costs and limited tactile feedback, which may be overcome with
implementing new technologies that may improve the effectiveness of immersive
medical applications such as XR, psychophysiological feedback or integration of
artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time data analysis and personalized
healthcare and training.

Abstract: We report preliminary insights from an exploratory study on non-standard
non-invasive interfaces for Smart Home Technologies (SHT). This study is part
of a broader research project on effective Smart Home ecosystem Sagacity that
will target older adults, impaired persons, and other groups disadvantaged in
the main technology discourse. Therefore, this research is in line with a
long-term research framework of the HASE research group (Human Aspects in
Science and Engineering) by the Living Lab Kobo. In our study, based on the
prototype of the comprehensive SHT management system Sagacity, we investigated
the potential of bioelectric signals, in particular EMG and EOG as a
complementary interface for SHT. Based on our previous participatory research
and studies on multimodal interfaces, including VUI and BCI, we prepared an
in-depth interactive hands-on experience workshops with direct involvement of
various groups of potential end users, including older adults and impaired
persons (total 18 subjects) to explore and investigate the potential of
solutions based on this type of non-standard interfaces. The preliminary
insights from the study unveil the potential of EMG/EOG interfaces in
multimodal SHT management, alongside limitations and challenges stemming from
the current state of technology and recommendations for designing multimodal
interaction paradigms pinpointing areas of interest to pursue in further
studies.

### [211] [Game-Theoretic Gradient Control for Robust Neural Network Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19143)
*Maria Zaitseva,Ivan Tomilov,Natalia Gusarova*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为“梯度丢弃”的方法，通过修改反向传播过程来增强前馈神经网络对输入噪声的鲁棒性，并结合目标变量噪声处理，实验表明在特定条件下能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前馈神经网络（FFNNs）对输入噪声敏感，现有正则化方法（如丢弃法）常改变网络结构或忽略神经元交互。本研究旨在通过改进反向传播和引入目标变量噪声来增强鲁棒性。

Method: 将反向传播视为多智能体博弈，提出“梯度丢弃”方法，在反向传播时以概率1-p选择性屏蔽隐藏层神经元梯度，同时保持前向传播活跃。此外，目标变量被白噪声或稳定分布噪声扰动。

Result: 在十个多样化表格数据集上的实验显示，方法的鲁棒性和准确性因数据集和超参数而异。回归任务中，梯度丢弃（p=0.9）结合稳定分布噪声显著提升了输入噪声鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法展现了潜力，强调了自适应参数调优的重要性，并为在博弈论框架下分析神经网络的涌现行为提供了新思路。

Abstract: Feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs) are vulnerable to input noise, reducing
prediction performance. Existing regularization methods like dropout often
alter network architecture or overlook neuron interactions. This study aims to
enhance FFNN noise robustness by modifying backpropagation, interpreted as a
multi-agent game, and exploring controlled target variable noising. Our
"gradient dropout" selectively nullifies hidden layer neuron gradients with
probability 1 - p during backpropagation, while keeping forward passes active.
This is framed within compositional game theory. Additionally, target variables
were perturbed with white noise or stable distributions. Experiments on ten
diverse tabular datasets show varying impacts: improvement or diminishing of
robustness and accuracy, depending on dataset and hyperparameters. Notably, on
regression tasks, gradient dropout (p = 0.9) combined with stable distribution
target noising significantly increased input noise robustness, evidenced by
flatter MSE curves and more stable SMAPE values. These results highlight the
method's potential, underscore the critical role of adaptive parameter tuning,
and open new avenues for analyzing neural networks as complex adaptive systems
exhibiting emergent behavior within a game-theoretic framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖艺术家团队手工建模，成本高且难以准确还原真实世界景观的多样性。

Method: 通过自动放大真实扫描数据并实时渲染3D内容，实现高质量近距离探索。

Result: 能够生成高质量、多样化的3D内容，适用于多种应用场景。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了成本并提高了准确性，适用于大规模户外3D内容的生成。

Abstract: Building realistic wide scale outdoor 3D content with sufficient visual
quality to observe at walking eye level or from driven vehicles is often
carried out by large teams of artists skilled in modelling, texturing, material
shading and lighting, which typically leads to both prohibitive costs and
reduced accuracy honoring the variety of real world ground truth landscapes. In
our proposed method, we define a process to automatically amplify real-world
scanned data and render real-time in animated 3D to explore at close range with
high quality for training, simulation, video game and visualisation
applications.

Result: 生成的城市在不同发展阶段均具有视觉吸引力，且支持从地形描述到高低级参数的灵活输入。

Conclusion: 通过简单规则和代理交互，模型具有可扩展性，能够模拟城市的社会文化影响。

Abstract: We propose a method to procedurally generate a familiar yet complex human
artifact: the city. We are not trying to reproduce existing cities, but to
generate artificial cities that are convincing and plausible by capturing
developmental behavior. In addition, our results are meant to build upon
themselves, such that they ought to look compelling at any point along the
transition from village to metropolis. Our approach largely focuses upon land
usage and building distribution for creating realistic city environments,
whereas previous attempts at city modeling have mainly focused on populating
road networks. Finally, we want our model to be self automated to the point
that the only necessary input is a terrain description, but other high-level
and low-level parameters can be specified to support artistic contributions.
With the aid of agent based simulation we are generating a system of agents and
behaviors that interact with one another through their effects upon a simulated
environment. Our philosophy is that as each agent follows a simple behavioral
rule set, a more complex behavior will tend to emerge out of the interactions
between the agents and their differing rule sets. By confining our model to a
set of simple rules for each class of agents, we hope to make our model
extendible not only in regard to the types of structures that are produced, but
also in describing the social and cultural influences prevalent in all cities

Conclusion: TiVy有效解决了时间序列可视化的可扩展性问题，提供高效且清晰的交互式可视化工具。

Abstract: Visualizing multiple time series presents fundamental tradeoffs between
scalability and visual clarity. Time series capture the behavior of many
large-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities.
Users often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or
superposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and
patterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when
covering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small
multiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that
summarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into
a set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar
subsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a
visual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer
small multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar
subsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an
interactive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in
real-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts
clear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a
significant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering. We
also demonstrate the efficiency of our approach to explore hidden structures in
massive time series data in two usage scenarios.
