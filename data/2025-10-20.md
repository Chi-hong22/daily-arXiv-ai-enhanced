### [1] [GAZE:Governance-Aware pre-annotation for Zero-shot World Model Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14992)
*Leela Krishna,Mengyang Zhao,Saicharithreddy Pasula,Harshit Rajgarhia,Abhishek Mukherji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为GAZE的自动化流水线，能够将原始长视频转换为可用于世界模型训练的丰富监督数据，显著提高标注效率和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练鲁棒的世界模型需要大规模、精确标注的多模态数据集，但传统手动标注过程缓慢且昂贵，成为瓶颈。

Method: 采用三步流水线：(i) 将专有360度格式标准化为标准视图并分片处理；(ii) 应用多种AI模型进行密集多模态预标注；(iii) 将信号整合为结构化输出规范供人工快速验证。

Result: 工作流显著提高效率（每审核小时节省约19分钟），通过保守自动跳过低显著性片段减少人工审核量80%以上，生成高质量、隐私感知的数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可扩展的蓝图，可在不牺牲吞吐量或治理的情况下生成高质量的世界模型训练数据。

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

### [2] [PC-UNet: An Enforcing Poisson Statistics U-Net for Positron Emission Tomography Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14995)
*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PC-UNet模型和PVMC-Loss损失函数，通过整合物理数据来改善低剂量PET图像的去噪效果，提高图像保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET临床应用中，高信噪比剂量会增加辐射暴露，而降低剂量会引入泊松噪声，现有去噪方法无法有效处理这种噪声，导致图像失真和伪影。

Method: 开发Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet)模型，提出Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss)损失函数，该损失函数在方差和梯度适应方面具有统计无偏性，可作为广义矩方法的实现。

Result: 在PET数据集上的测试表明，PC-UNet提高了物理一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: PC-UNet能够有效整合物理信息，改善低剂量PET图像质量。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker是一种轻量级、无需优化的推理时方法，通过直接干预模型的注意力图来缓解文本到图像模型中的语义泄漏问题，在保持图像质量的同时有效抑制实体间的意外特征传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型容易受到语义泄漏的影响，即不同实体之间意外传递语义相关特征。现有缓解策略通常基于优化或依赖外部输入，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: DeLeaker在扩散过程中动态重新加权注意力图，抑制过度的跨实体交互，同时强化每个实体的身份特征。该方法无需优化过程，直接在推理时进行干预。

Result: 实验表明DeLeaker在所有基线方法中表现最佳，即使基线方法使用外部信息时也是如此。该方法能有效缓解语义泄漏，同时不损害图像的保真度和质量。

Conclusion: DeLeaker证明了注意力控制在缓解语义泄漏方面的价值，为开发更语义精确的文本到图像模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [4] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse是一个数据驱动的真实到仿真系统，可将众包城市游览视频转换为物理感知的交互式仿真场景，包含10万+标注的3D城市资产库和自动生成管线，在导航任务中表现出强大的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市嵌入式AI代理需要多样化、高保真的城市环境进行训练，但现有仿真场景要么缺乏可扩展性，要么无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性。

Method: UrbanVerse包含UrbanVerse-100K（10万+标注城市3D资产库）和UrbanVerse-Gen（从视频提取场景布局并使用检索资产实例化度量级3D仿真的自动管线）。

Result: UrbanVerse场景保持了真实世界的语义和布局，在人类评估的真实感上与手动制作的场景相当。在导航任务中，相比先前方法，仿真中成功率提高+6.3%，零样本仿真到真实迁移中提高+30.1%。

Conclusion: UrbanVerse通过数据驱动的方法成功解决了城市仿真场景的可扩展性和真实性问题，为城市AI代理训练提供了高质量的环境，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [5] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D是一个无需训练的3D物体编辑框架，通过FlowEdit和TRELLIS实现局部编辑，引入Voxel/Slat-Merge策略保持结构一致性，并创建了首个大规模3D编辑数据集Nano3D-Edit-100k。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D编辑方法效率低下、不一致、无法保护未编辑区域的问题，避免基于多视角渲染重建带来的伪影和实用性限制。

Method: 将FlowEdit集成到TRELLIS中，通过前视图渲染指导局部编辑，引入区域感知合并策略Voxel/Slat-Merge，自适应保持编辑与未编辑区域的一致性。

Result: 实验表明Nano3D在3D一致性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法，并构建了包含10万+高质量3D编辑对的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了算法设计和数据可用性的长期挑战，显著提高了3D编辑的通用性和可靠性，为前馈式3D编辑模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

### [6] [BiomedXPro: Prompt Optimization for Explainable Diagnosis with Biomedical Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15866)
*Kaushitha Silva,Mansitha Eashwara,Sanduni Ubayasiri,Ruwan Tennakoon,Damayanthi Herath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BiomedXPro是一个进化框架，利用大语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对用于疾病诊断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学视觉语言模型在临床应用中受到限制，因为现有的提示优化技术要么产生不可解释的潜在向量，要么只生成单一文本提示，缺乏透明度且无法捕捉临床诊断的多方面特性。

Method: 使用大语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，通过进化框架自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中，BiomedXPro始终优于最先进的提示调优方法，特别是在数据稀缺的少样本设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: BiomedXPro通过生成多样化的可解释提示集合，为模型预测提供了可验证的基础，是开发更可信和临床对齐AI系统的重要一步。

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ECHO框架，通过社交媒体帖子构建图像生成模型基准测试，发现了现有基准测试中缺失的创造性任务，并能更好地区分最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试滞后于图像生成模型的新能力，无法捕捉新兴用例，导致社区认知与正式评估之间存在差距。

Method: 从展示新颖提示和用户定性判断的社交媒体帖子中构建基准测试，应用于GPT-4o Image Gen，收集了31,000多个提示。

Result: ECHO发现现有基准测试中缺失的创造性复杂任务，能更清晰地区分最先进模型，并通过社区反馈指导模型质量度量设计。

Conclusion: ECHO框架通过真实使用证据构建基准测试，能更好地评估图像生成模型的新兴能力，填补现有评估方法的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [8] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的子模块框架，用于从庞大的LoRA适配器数据库中智能选择和组合最相关且多样化的模型，解决了用户在海量适配器中导航和选择的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Civit.ai等平台上有超过10万个LoRA适配器，但由于数量庞大、多样性高且缺乏结构化组织，用户在选择和有效使用最适合的适配器方面面临挑战。

Method: 将LoRA模型选择任务构建为组合优化问题，并提出了一种新颖的子模块框架来解决这一问题。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法能够在广泛领域内生成多样化的输出结果。

Conclusion: 提出的子模块框架有效解决了从海量LoRA适配器数据库中选择最相关和多样化模型的问题，为用户提供了更好的适配器选择体验。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

### [9] [MOBIUS: Big-to-Mobile Universal Instance Segmentation via Multi-modal Bottleneck Fusion and Calibrated Decoder Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15026)
*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS是一个用于通用实例分割的基础模型家族，通过瓶颈像素解码器、语言引导不确定性校准损失和统一训练策略，在减少55%像素FLOPs和75%变换器解码器FLOPs的同时保持SOTA性能，仅需1/3训练迭代。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型计算成本高，限制了在资源受限平台上的部署。需要开发既能保持高性能又能在边缘设备上高效部署的模型架构。

Method: 提出瓶颈像素解码器用于高效多尺度多模态融合，语言引导不确定性校准损失用于自适应解码器剪枝，以及简化的统一训练策略。

Result: MOBIUS在减少大量计算开销的同时保持了最先进的性能，在高性能计算平台和移动设备上都建立了新的效率基准。

Conclusion: MOBIUS为通用实例分割提供了帕累托最优的缩放方案，支持从高端加速器到移动硬件的广泛设备部署，实现了效率与性能的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

TL;DR: COGS是一个数据高效框架，通过将种子问题分解为感知和推理因子，然后系统性地重新组合生成大量合成问答对，从而为多模态大语言模型提供高级推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在缺乏大规模人工标注推理数据的人工图像领域（如图表、渲染文档等）中推理能力受限的问题。

Method: 将每个种子问题分解为原始感知和推理因子，然后系统性地将这些因子与新图像重新组合，生成大量合成问答对，并使用因子级过程奖励进行强化学习。

Result: 在图表推理任务中，COGS显著提高了对未见问题的性能，特别是在推理密集和组合问题上表现最佳。因子级混合训练还能实现更好的跨数据集迁移。

Conclusion: COGS框架能够有效提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，且具有良好的泛化性，可扩展到网页等其他领域。

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

TL;DR: GDGen是一个从势能角度统一刚体、关节体和软体动力学的框架，通过引入方向刚度来捕捉广泛的物理行为，为创建交互式虚拟环境和训练机器人智能体提供通用基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生世界为在可扫描环境中开发具有复杂物理行为的通用具身智能体提供了新机会，需要统一不同物理系统的动力学表示。

Method: 从势能原理出发，将世界视为整体实体，通过运动观测推断物理属性；扩展经典弹性动力学，引入方向刚度；使用专门网络建模扩展材料属性，采用神经场以几何无关方式表示变形。

Result: 广泛实验表明GDGen能够稳健地统一多种仿真范式，为创建交互式虚拟环境和在复杂动态场景中训练机器人智能体提供多功能基础。

Conclusion: GDGen通过势能视角成功统一了刚体、关节体和软体动力学，为数字孪生世界和具身智能体开发提供了统一的动力学生成框架。

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出COLIPRI编码器家族，通过引入报告生成目标和结合视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练，缓解3D医学影像领域数据不足问题，在多个任务上实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D医学影像领域的数据稀缺限制了当前视觉语言编码器的能力，需要解决数据不足的问题

Method: 引入额外的归纳偏置：报告生成目标，并将视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练结合，利用图像-文本对数据集和纯图像数据集

Result: COLIPRI编码器在报告生成、分类探测和零样本分类任务上达到最先进性能，在语义分割任务上保持竞争力

Conclusion: 通过结合额外的归纳偏置和3D医学影像领域的最佳实践，成功开发了高性能的COLIPRI编码器家族

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种轻量级方法，通过在梯度空间中转移推理知识来增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力，避免了资源密集型的监督微调或强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的推理能力通常落后于纯文本模型，而现有的增强方法需要大量资源。模型合并虽然是一种替代方案，但其效果在不同模型家族间差异很大。

Method: 提出DRIFT方法：预计算推理先验（推理模型与多模态模型的参数差异），在微调过程中用该先验来偏置梯度，从而在不破坏多模态对齐的情况下转移推理知识。

Result: 在MathVista和MathVerse等基准测试中，DRIFT一致优于朴素合并和监督微调，以较低成本达到或超过训练密集型方法的性能。

Conclusion: DRIFT提供了一种高效且轻量的方式来增强多模态模型的推理能力，保持了标准监督微调流程的简单性，同时实现了有效的推理知识转移。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

TL;DR: SaLon3R是一个结构感知的长期3D高斯溅射重建框架，通过引入紧凑锚点基元和3D点Transformer，在单次前向传播中有效消除冗余并解决几何不一致性，实现超过50视图、10FPS的在线重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法在长序列视频中预测逐像素高斯并组合所有视图，导致大量冗余和几何不一致问题，需要更高效和一致的重建方法。

Method: 使用3D重建骨干网络预测密集逐像素高斯和几何复杂度显著图，通过可微分显著感知高斯量化将冗余高斯压缩为紧凑锚点，再用3D点Transformer学习空间结构先验来精炼锚点属性和显著度。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，该方法在50-90%冗余消除的情况下，实现了最先进的性能，在超过50个视图、10FPS的在线重建中表现出色。

Conclusion: SaLon3R无需已知相机参数或测试时优化，在单次前向传播中有效解决伪影并修剪冗余3DGS，展示了长期通用3D重建的优越效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

TL;DR: TGT框架通过文本引导的轨迹控制视频生成，使用位置感知交叉注意力和双CFG方案，实现了对多对象场景的精确控制和运动处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法在多对象场景中控制精度有限，缺乏明确的轨迹与视觉实体对应关系，难以处理复杂场景。

Method: 提出文本引导轨迹框架，结合位置感知交叉注意力机制和双CFG方案，构建包含200万高质量视频剪辑的数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验表明TGT在视觉质量、文本对齐精度和运动可控性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TGT通过轨迹与文本的配对控制，显著提升了视频生成中对多对象外观和运动的精确控制能力。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了FFT-MIL框架，通过傅里叶变换在频域中提取全局上下文信息，增强全切片图像分类中的多实例学习性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多实例学习的全切片图像分类方法难以捕获全局依赖关系，因为WSI尺寸巨大且补丁嵌入具有局部性，这限制了建模诊断预测所需的粗粒度结构

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换从WSI中提取低频裁剪，通过包含卷积层和Min-Max归一化的FFT-Block处理频域数据，然后将学习到的全局频域特征与空间补丁特征融合

Result: 在三个公开数据集（BRACS、LUAD、IMP）上评估了六种最先进的MIL方法，集成FFT-Block后平均提升宏F1分数3.51%，AUC提升1.51%

Conclusion: 频域学习是捕获WSI分类中全局依赖关系的有效且高效机制，补充了空间特征，提升了基于MIL的计算病理学的可扩展性和准确性

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

TL;DR: 提出了XModBench基准，用于评估全模态大语言模型在跨模态一致性方面的表现，发现当前模型在空间和时间推理、模态差异和方向不平衡方面存在显著问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估通用跨模态问答能力，但无法确定模型是否真正实现了模态不变推理或存在模态特定偏差。

Method: 构建包含60,828个多选题的大规模三模态基准XModBench，涵盖五种任务类型和六种模态组合，用于细粒度诊断模型的跨模态一致性。

Result: 实验显示最强模型Gemini 2.5 Pro在空间和时间推理上准确率低于60%，存在持续的模态差异（音频表现显著差于文本），以及系统性的方向不平衡（视觉作为上下文时一致性较低）。

Conclusion: 当前全模态大语言模型距离真正的模态不变推理还很远，XModBench可作为评估和改进跨模态能力的基本诊断工具。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像-文本描述数据和交错文档数据上持续预训练，但针对图像-文本交错文档数据的高质量数据筛选研究不足。

Method: 采用半合成方法，利用原始图像生成不同质量级别的文本，创建样本-分数对来训练UniFilter分类器，然后应用该分类器筛选DataComp和OBELICS数据集中的高质量数据。

Result: 在筛选数据上预训练的MLLM相比基线方法展现出显著增强的零样本推理和上下文学习能力，经过视觉监督微调后在多个基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: UniFilter能有效筛选高质量多模态数据，提升MLLM性能，为社区提供了合成训练数据、模型检查点和高质量OBELICS-HQ子集。

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决组织病理学基础模型训练中的可重复性挑战，这些挑战主要源于软件随机性、硬件非确定性和不一致的超参数报告。

Method: 在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估不同超参数设置和数据增强策略在三个下游组织病理学数据集（PatchCamelyon、LC25000-Lung和LC25000-Colon）上的影响。

Result: 发现明确趋势：RandomResizedCrop值0.7-0.8优于更激进或保守的设置；分布式训练无局部损失提高了稳定性；学习率低于5.0e-5在所有数据集上持续降低性能；LC25000（Colon）数据集提供了最可重复的基准。

Conclusion: 计算病理学中的可重复性不仅依赖于透明文档，还需要精心选择的实验配置，研究提供了实用规则来指导未来开发可重复的数字病理学基础模型。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

Motivation: 现有基于图像和文本提示的生成数据增强方法难以在保真度和多样性之间取得平衡，因为合成过程中的表示往往与非必要的输入图像属性（如环境上下文）纠缠，与修改这些元素的文本提示产生冲突。

Method: 使用显著概念感知图像嵌入模型来减少合成过程中无关视觉细节的影响，保持图像和文本输入之间的直观对齐，生成更好地保留类别判别特征并具有额外受控变化的图像。

Result: 在八个细粒度视觉数据集上表现出优越性能，在常规和长尾设置下分别以0.73%和6.5%的平均分类准确率提升优于最先进的增强方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减少无关视觉细节的影响，在保持图像-文本对齐的同时增强数据多样性，有效提升了下游模型的鲁棒性，在各种设置下均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset

Motivation: 现有驾驶场景合成方法存在计算需求过高、仅关注视频合成而缺乏3D表示，或局限于静态单场景重建的问题，需要填补这一方法学空白。

Method: 采用统一流水线：FastDrive-DiT（高效视频扩散变换器用于高分辨率时序一致视频合成）和FastRecon3D（前馈重建模块快速构建跨时间3D高斯表示）。

Result: 实现了实时生成长达424×800分辨率、12 FPS的扩展驾驶视频和对应动态3D场景，在新视角合成上获得SSIM 0.811和PSNR 22.84。

Conclusion: DriveGen3D成功整合了加速视频生成和动态3D重建，在保持参数效率的同时实现了高质量的动态驾驶场景生成。

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D
representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction.
Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to
$424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM
of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining
parameter efficiency.

Conclusion: 通过设计考虑控制特定动态视觉信息的新条件，能够有效利用预训练扩散模型获得任务自适应的视觉表示，显著提升机器人控制性能。

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control

Result: 综合评估表明，所提出的流程提高了修复区域的解剖合理性和视觉保真度，比单个基线模型产生更高的准确性和更稳健的结果。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader
clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research. Our 2025

TL;DR: 提出QCFace方法，通过硬边界策略解决人脸识别中可识别性与身份特征纠缠的问题，实现更好的特征表示和性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸识别系统在可识别性表示方面存在两个主要问题：软边界约束只能部分捕捉可识别性，导致质量表示较弱；特征方向和幅度的梯度重叠导致优化不稳定和表示纠缠

Method: 引入硬边界策略QCFace，使用基于硬边界的损失函数，通过引导因子进行超球面规划，同时优化识别能力和明确的可识别性表示

Result: QCFace不仅提供了稳健且可量化的可识别性编码，在验证和识别基准测试中都达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: QCFace方法有效解决了可识别性与身份特征的纠缠问题，实现了更好的特征解耦和识别性能

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于单正多标签学习的双曲几何分类框架，将标签表示为双曲球而非点或向量，通过几何球体交互建模丰富的标签关系


<details>

Motivation: 解决单正多标签学习中每个训练样本仅标注一个正标签但可能属于多个类别的挑战，现有方法缺乏对不同关系类型的显式几何定义

Method: 使用双曲球表示标签，通过球体包含、重叠和分离自然建模层次结构、共现模式和语义独立性；引入温度自适应双曲球分类器和物理启发的双势阱正则化

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验显示具有竞争力的性能，统计分析表明学习到的嵌入与现实世界共现模式强相关

Conclusion: 双曲几何为不完全监督下的结构化分类提供了更鲁棒的范式，具有优越的可解释性

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

TL;DR: SVG是一种新型的潜在扩散模型，它不使用变分自编码器，而是利用自监督表示进行视觉生成。该方法通过使用冻结的DINO特征构建具有清晰语义区分度的特征空间，同时通过轻量级残差分支捕捉细节，实现了更高效的扩散训练和更好的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VAE+扩散范式存在训练效率低、推理速度慢、迁移性差等问题，这些问题源于VAE潜在空间缺乏清晰的语义分离和强判别结构。作者发现这些属性对于感知理解任务和潜在扩散模型的稳定高效训练至关重要。

Method: SVG利用冻结的DINO特征构建具有语义区分度的特征空间，同时使用轻量级残差分支捕捉细粒度细节。扩散模型直接在这个语义结构化的潜在空间上进行训练。

Result: SVG实现了加速扩散训练、支持少步采样，并提高了生成质量。实验结果表明SVG保留了底层自监督表示的语义和判别能力。

Conclusion: SVG为任务通用、高质量的视觉表示提供了一条有原则的路径，展示了自监督表示在视觉生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

TL;DR: CoMe是一个渐进式层剪枝框架，通过基于拼接的合并技术和分层蒸馏后训练过程，解决大语言模型结构化剪枝中的性能下降问题，在剪除30%参数时仍能保持83%的原始准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能优秀，但巨大的模型规模带来了高计算和存储需求。现有结构化剪枝方法直接移除层会导致显著性能下降，且缺乏有效的后训练恢复机制。

Method: 提出CoMe框架：1) 使用基于激活强度和权重范数的通道敏感度指标进行细粒度通道选择；2) 采用基于拼接的层合并方法融合相邻层的关键通道；3) 设计分层蒸馏协议，利用剪枝过程中建立的原始模型与剪枝模型层间对应关系进行知识迁移。

Result: 在7个基准测试上的实验表明，CoMe达到最先进性能。当剪除LLaMA-2-7b模型30%参数时，剪枝后的模型仍能保持83%的原始平均准确率。

Conclusion: CoMe通过渐进式剪枝、基于拼接的合并和分层蒸馏，有效解决了结构化剪枝中的性能下降问题，为大语言模型的高效压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MPI-Lab/CoMe.

TL;DR: Proto-Former是一个统一、自适应、端到端的面部关键点检测框架，通过增强数据集特定的面部结构表示（原型）来克服单数据集训练的局限性，支持多数据集联合训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部关键点检测数据集定义不同数量的关键点，主流方法只能在单个数据集上训练，限制了模型泛化能力和统一模型的发展。

Method: 提出Proto-Former框架，包含自适应原型感知编码器（APAE）进行自适应特征提取和学习原型表示，以及渐进式原型感知解码器（PPAD）细化原型生成提示，引导模型关注关键面部区域。引入原型感知（PA）损失函数，通过约束原型专家选择权重实现最优路径寻找。

Conclusion: Proto-Former通过统一架构支持多数据集训练，有效解决了原型专家寻址不稳定问题，缓解了梯度冲突，能够提取更准确的面部结构特征。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注2D空间理解，缺乏全面评估6D空间推理能力的框架，因此需要开发新的数据集来测试大型多模态模型在复杂3维空间推理方面的能力。

Method: 创建了Spatial457合成数据集，包含4个关键空间推理能力：多目标识别、2D位置、3D位置和3D方向，采用级联评估结构构建了7种问题类型和5个难度级别。

Result: 评估显示大型多模态模型在任务复杂度增加时性能普遍下降，特别是在3D推理和6D空间任务中，并发现了不同属性间的预测偏差。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在复杂3维空间推理方面存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进其空间理解能力。

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for
complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing
benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework
to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities.
To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased
synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning:
multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We
develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across
5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new
proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large
multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in
performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D
spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative
Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning
capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also
uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns
observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in

Motivation: 当前的人体运动重建方法在准确将人体放置在3D空间中存在困难，而逼真的角色与环境交互对于游戏、AR/VR和机器人等应用至关重要。

Method: SHARE首先估计每帧的人体网格和分割掩码，以及关键帧的场景点云图。通过迭代比较人体网格与从场景中提取的人体点云来优化关键帧位置，同时保持非关键帧与关键帧的相对根关节位置一致性。

Result: 广泛实验表明SHARE优于现有方法，能够实现更准确的3D人体定位，同时重建周围场景。

Conclusion: SHARE方法能够有效利用场景几何信息，在精心策划的数据集和野外网络视频上都能实现准确的人体运动重建。

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: 脑电和皮层电信号在运动想象分类中易受生理伪影干扰，现有Transformer方法难以捕捉细粒度依赖关系。

Method: 扩展深度状态空间模型，整合捕捉脑电信号的时域、空域和频域依赖关系。

Result: 在三个基准测试中（两个大规模公共EEG数据集和一个临床ECoG数据集）均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Cortical-SSM能有效捕捉脑电信号的神经生理相关区域，在运动想象分类任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

Motivation: 微创手术中的自动化手术工具检测具有重要价值，但手术场景中标注数据有限，这给训练鲁棒的深度学习模型带来了挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段自适应微调方法：1) 线性探测阶段，在预训练的CNN架构上调节额外分类层；2) 渐进冻结阶段，动态减少可微调层数，以控制对手术领域的适应。

Result: 在Cholec80数据集上，该方法相比现有方法和标准微调技术提升了检测性能，达到96.4%的平均精度。在CATARACTS眼科手术数据集上进一步验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 渐进冻结微调是改进不同手术程序中工具存在检测的有前景技术，在通用图像分类任务中具有更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

Conclusion: 提出的FreqPDE方法能够有效提升3D物体检测性能，无需LiDAR显式监督，解决了现有方法在深度预测质量、跨视图一致性和尺度不变性方面的不足。

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

TL;DR: PFGS是一个姿态感知的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过多姿态图像融合解决单姿态重建不完整的问题，实现更完整的物体重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法假设物体在单一静态姿态下捕获，导致重建不完整，无法恢复被遮挡或自遮挡区域。

Method: 通过迭代融合主姿态和辅助姿态图像，结合全局和局部配准策略，利用背景特征进行姿态估计和基础模型进行跨姿态配准。

Result: PFGS在定性和定量评估中均优于强基线方法，产生更完整的重建结果和更高保真度的3DGS模型。

Conclusion: PFGS通过智能整合基础模型和背景特征，有效解决了多姿态融合中的挑战，实现了更完整和高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Conclusion: LILAC成功将离线VAE-扩散框架扩展到在线设置，实现了实时长序列任意运动风格化，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

*Bingyu Li,Feiyu Wang,Da Zhang,Zhiyuan Zhao,Junyu Gao,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MARIS基准测试和统一框架，解决水下开放词汇实例分割中的视觉退化和语义对齐问题，通过几何先验增强和语义对齐注入提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水下实例分割方法受限于封闭词汇预测，无法识别新的海洋类别，且水下场景存在视觉退化和语义对齐问题。

Method: 提出统一框架包含两个组件：几何先验增强模块(GPEM)利用部件级和结构线索保持对象一致性；语义对齐注入机制(SAIM)用领域特定先验丰富语言嵌入。

Result: 实验表明该框架在MARIS基准测试中在域内和跨域设置下均优于现有开放词汇基线方法。

Conclusion: 为未来水下感知研究建立了坚实基础，有效解决了水下开放词汇分割的挑战。

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

TL;DR: LoSP-Prompt是一个用于多器官多切片多方向多b值扩散加权磁共振成像的重建框架，通过物理建模和合成数据驱动的提示学习，自动消除运动引起的相位伪影，实现高分辨率成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床采用多射散扩散加权磁共振成像进行全身肿瘤诊断受到呼吸、蠕动等运动引起的严重相位伪影的限制，加上多器官、多切片、多方向和多b值的复杂性，需要一种能够克服这些挑战的重建方法。

Method: 将射散间相位变化建模为高阶局部平滑相位，集成到低秩Hankel矩阵重建中。通过仅在模拟生理运动的合成腹部DWI数据上训练的提示学习自动设置算法的秩参数。

Result: 在10,000+临床图像上验证，LoSP-Prompt实现了临床单射散DWI两倍的空间分辨率，增强了肝脏病变的显着性；在七个不同解剖区域（肝脏、肾脏、骶髂、骨盆、膝盖、脊髓、大脑）上使用单一模型实现泛化；在图像质量、伪影抑制和噪声降低方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了导航信号和真实数据监督，为高分辨率多器官多射散DWI提供了可解释、稳健的解决方案，其与扫描仪无关的性能显示了在精准肿瘤学中的变革潜力。

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

*Shuang Liang,Zhihao Xu,Jialing Tao,Hui Xue,Xiting Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LoD框架，通过任务特定学习而非攻击特定学习来检测未知的越狱攻击，包含多模态安全概念激活向量模块和无监督攻击分类模块，在多样未知攻击上实现更高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型尽管经过对齐，仍易受越狱攻击威胁。现有检测方法要么学习攻击特定参数导致泛化能力差，要么依赖启发式原则限制准确性和效率。

Method: 提出学习检测框架，包含多模态安全概念激活向量模块进行安全导向表示学习，以及安全模式自动编码器模块进行无监督攻击分类。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多样未知攻击上实现一致的更高检测AUROC，同时提高了效率。

Conclusion: LoD框架通过将重点从攻击特定学习转向任务特定学习，能够准确检测未知越狱攻击，提供更好的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

### [44] [Semantic4Safety: Causal Insights from Zero-shot Street View Imagery Segmentation for Urban Road Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15434)
*Huan Chen,Ting Han,Siyu Chen,Zhihao Guo,Yiping Chen,Meiliu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic4Safety框架，使用零样本语义分割从街景图像中提取11个可解释的街道指标，结合道路类型分析3万起事故记录，通过XGBoost分类器、SHAP解释和因果推断方法揭示不同类型事故的因果模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决街景图像在交通安全分析中的两个基本挑战：如何构建捕捉事故相关特征的街道级指标，以及如何量化它们对不同事故类型的因果影响。

Method: 应用零样本语义分割从街景图像中提取11个可解释的街道指标，结合道路类型作为上下文信息；训练XGBoost多类分类器并使用SHAP解释特征贡献；应用广义倾向得分加权和平均处理效应估计来控制混杂因素并量化因果效应。

Result: 揭示了异质性的、特定于事故类型的因果模式：捕捉场景复杂性、暴露度和道路几何形状的特征主导预测能力；更大的可驾驶区域和应急空间降低风险，而过度视觉开放性可能增加风险。

Conclusion: 通过将预测建模与因果推断相结合，Semantic4Safety支持有针对性的干预措施和高风险走廊诊断，为城市道路安全规划提供了可扩展的、数据驱动的工具。

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

### [45] [Rethinking Convergence in Deep Learning: The Predictive-Corrective Paradigm for Anatomy-Informed Brain MRI Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15439)
*Feifei Zhang,Zhenhong Jia,Sensen Song,Fei Shi,Dayong Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了预测-校正（PC）范式，通过解耦建模任务来加速学习。基于此构建了PCMambaNet网络，包含预测先验模块和校正残差网络，在脑MRI分割中仅需1-5个epoch就能达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端深度学习在数据稀缺领域（如医学影像）中收敛慢、依赖大数据集的问题，提高学习效率和适用性。

Method: 预测-校正范式：预测先验模块利用解剖知识（双侧对称性）生成粗略近似和焦点图，校正残差网络学习残差误差，专注于精炼挑战区域和病理边界。

Result: 在高分辨率脑MRI分割实验中，PCMambaNet达到最先进精度，且仅需1-5个epoch收敛，这是传统端到端模型无法实现的性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式融入领域知识简化学习目标，PCMambaNet有效缓解了数据效率低下和过拟合问题，实现了显著加速。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

### [46] [Select Less, Reason More: Prioritizing Evidence Purity for Video Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15440)
*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Shiyu Hu,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出证据优先的自适应框架EARL，通过强化学习动态选择关键帧并进行局部重采样，解决长视频推理中的信息稀释问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在长视频推理中存在信息稀释和关键证据模糊的问题，像素空间视频推理代理缺乏严格的奖励机制来确保证据纯度，且无法在预采样帧之外进行时间信息补充。

Method: 采用证据感知强化学习框架，将模型转变为主动的证据询问者，动态选择最相关帧并在关键帧周围进行局部重采样以获取细粒度时间细节。

Result: 在五个视频推理基准测试中达到开源视频大语言模型的最新水平，7B模型在LongVideoBench上达到59.8%，MVBench上69.0%，VideoMME上64.9%。

Conclusion: 证据纯度的优先考虑和所提出框架的有效性对于长视频推理至关重要，实现了"选择更少，推理更多"的核心理念。

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

### [47] [MAVR-Net: Robust Multi-View Learning for MAV Action Recognition with Cross-View Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15448)
*Nengbo Zhang,Hann Woei Ho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAVR-Net是一个基于多视角学习的微型飞行器动作识别框架，通过结合RGB帧、光流和分割掩码三种互补数据，提升MAV运动识别的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于RGB数据的视觉识别模型难以捕捉MAV复杂的时空运动特征，限制了区分不同动作的能力。

Method: 使用ResNet编码器从每个视角提取特征，采用多尺度特征金字塔保留时空细节，引入跨视角注意力模块建模模态依赖关系，并设计多视角对齐损失确保语义一致性。

Result: 在基准MAV动作数据集上，该方法在Short MAV、Medium MAV和Long MAV数据集上分别达到97.8%、96.5%和92.8%的准确率，明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多视角学习方法能有效提升MAV动作识别性能，结合多种数据模态和跨视角交互机制是解决复杂时空运动识别的有效途径。

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

### [48] [DPTrack:Directional Kernel-Guided Prompt Learning for Robust Nighttime Aerial Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15449)
*Zhiqiang Zhu,Xinbo Gao,Wen Lu,Jie Li,Zhaoyang Wang,Mingqian Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTrack是一种基于提示学习的夜间航拍跟踪器，通过将目标属性特征编码到包含细粒度线索的方向核中，生成精确的提示来改善夜间跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的夜间航拍跟踪器仅依赖空间定位监督，无法提供指向目标特征的细粒度线索，导致提示模糊，跟踪性能不佳。

Method: DPTrack首先分层捕获目标的拓扑结构，利用拓扑属性丰富特征表示；然后编码器将这些拓扑感知特征压缩到方向核中；最后基于通道类别对应关系的核引导提示模块传播核到搜索区域特征中，定位目标特征位置并转换为精确提示。

Result: 在已建立的基准测试上进行广泛评估，证明了DPTrack的优越性能。

Conclusion: DPTrack通过编码目标属性特征到方向核中生成精确提示，有效解决了夜间航拍跟踪中提示模糊的问题，实现了鲁棒的夜间跟踪。

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack.

### [49] [Improving Micro-Expression Recognition with Phase-Aware Temporal Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15466)
*Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Luu Tu Nguyen,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于动态图像的双阶段时间增强方法，将微表情序列分解为起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个运动阶段，分别生成动态图像，有效增强运动多样性和时间线索，提升微表情识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，现有方法主要依赖简单的空间增强而忽视时间增强策略。数据限制不仅影响泛化能力，还限制了训练中捕获的运动模式多样性。

Method: 将每个微表情序列分解为起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个运动阶段，为每个阶段分别生成动态图像，形成双阶段动态图像增强策略。这种阶段特定的表示丰富了运动多样性并引入了关键的时间线索。

Result: 在CASME-II和SAMM数据集上使用六种深度架构进行广泛实验，在识别准确率、未加权F1分数和未加权平均召回率方面均获得一致性能提升，与空间增强结合时相对改进高达10%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、模型无关且在低资源设置下有效，为鲁棒和可泛化的微表情识别提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MRASfM是一个专门针对驾驶场景的多相机运动恢复结构框架，通过利用多相机系统的固定空间关系、平面模型去除错误点、将多相机视为单个单元进行优化，显著提高了相机姿态估计的可靠性、道路表面重建质量和重建效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法在应用于多相机系统捕获的驾驶场景时面临三大挑战：相机姿态估计不可靠、道路表面重建存在过多异常点、重建效率低下。

Method: 1. 利用多相机系统的固定空间关系提高相机姿态估计可靠性；2. 使用平面模型有效去除三角化道路表面的错误点；3. 在Bundle Adjustment中将多相机集视为单个单元以减少优化变量；4. 通过场景关联和组装模块实现多场景聚合。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到0.124的绝对姿态误差，表现出最先进的性能。在实际车辆部署中验证了MRASfM在各种场景下的泛化能力和在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MRASfM框架有效解决了驾驶场景中多相机SfM的关键问题，在姿态估计精度、重建质量和效率方面都取得了显著提升，为自动驾驶等应用提供了可靠的基础。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机技术的发展，视频数据量急剧增加，迫切需要高效的语义检索方法。无人机视频具有俯视视角、强结构同质性和目标组合语义表达多样性等特点，现有基于地面视角的跨模态方法难以有效建模这些特性。

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种结合起始-顶点和顶点-结束两个阶段的组合光流(COF)方法，用于面部微表情识别，相比仅关注起始-顶点阶段的传统方法，能更全面地捕捉微表情的动态特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于光流的微表情识别方法通常只关注起始-顶点阶段，而忽略了顶点-结束阶段所包含的关键时序动态信息，这限制了特征表示的完整性。

Method: 提出组合光流(COF)方法，整合微表情的起始-顶点和顶点-结束两个阶段，提供更全面的运动分析。

Result: 在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上的实验结果表明，COF方法优于基于单一光流的方法，在捕捉微表情动态方面表现出更好的效果。

Conclusion: 组合光流方法能够更有效地捕获微表情的完整动态特征，提高了微表情识别的性能。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
hidden emotions. Most Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) methods that rely on
optical flow typically focus on the onset-to-apex phase, neglecting the
apex-to-offset phase, which holds key temporal dynamics. This study introduces
a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature
representation. COF provides a more comprehensive motion analysis, improving
MER performance. Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show that
COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HiMA架构，结合Transformer和Mamba模块处理不同尺度特征，通过LoDA和MPF模块解决低光RAW图像增强中的光照不均和细节增强问题，在多个数据集上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光RAW图像增强中同时实现高质量和高效率的挑战，克服现有方法在两阶段框架中的模糊性问题。

Method: 采用分层混合架构HiMA，结合Transformer处理大尺度特征和Mamba处理小尺度特征；提出LoDA模块自适应调整局部区域特征分布；设计MPF模块融合空间和频域先验进行细节增强。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法超越了现有最先进方法，以更少的参数实现了更优的性能。

Conclusion: HiMA架构通过有效结合不同模块的优势，在低光RAW图像增强任务中实现了高效且高质量的增强效果。

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

### [55] [Latent Feature Alignment: Discovering Biased and Interpretable Subpopulations in Face Recognition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15520)
*Ignacio Serna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Latent Feature Alignment (LFA)算法，无需属性标签即可识别人脸识别模型中的偏差子群体，通过潜在方向实现语义一致的分组和可解释方向发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸识别模型虽然整体准确率高，但仍存在系统性偏差，传统偏差评估框架依赖昂贵且有限的预定义属性标签。

Method: 使用潜在方向识别子群体，相比标准聚类方法能获得语义更一致的分组，并发现与年龄、种族、着装等语义属性对应的可解释方向。

Result: 在四种最先进的人脸识别模型和两个基准测试中，LFA在组内语义一致性上始终优于k-means和最近邻搜索，同时揭示了与人口统计和上下文属性对齐的可解释潜在方向。

Conclusion: LFA可作为人脸识别模型表示审计的实用方法，使从业者无需预定义属性注释即可识别和解释偏差子群体。

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于卫星土地利用分类的自定义卷积神经网络架构，在EuroSAT数据集上实现了97.23%的测试准确率，无需预训练模型。主要贡献是平衡多任务注意力机制，结合空间和光谱特征提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卫星图像分类中的特定失败模式，探索无需依赖预训练模型的高效架构设计，特别关注空间和光谱模态的平衡利用。

Method: 通过三个渐进架构迭代：基线模型、CBAM增强模型和平衡多任务注意力模型。后者结合坐标注意力（空间特征）和挤压激励块（光谱特征），通过可学习融合参数统一。使用渐进DropBlock正则化和类别平衡损失加权。

Result: 最终12层架构达到97.23%测试准确率，Cohen's Kappa为0.9692，所有类别准确率超过94.46%。可学习融合参数自主收敛到约0.57，表明空间和光谱模态重要性接近相等。

Conclusion: 系统化架构设计在领域特定应用中有效，性能接近微调ResNet-50（差距仅1.34%），且无需外部数据。证明了空间和光谱特征平衡提取的重要性。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SiM2P是一个基于3D扩散桥的框架，能够从MRI和患者辅助信息生成诊断质量的FDG-PET图像，显著提高了痴呆症诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET在痴呆症诊断中很有价值，但相比常规MRI可及性差且成本高，需要开发更经济可及的替代方案。

Method: 使用3D扩散桥框架学习从MRI和患者信息到FDG-PET图像的概率映射，仅需20个站点特定病例和基本人口统计信息即可部署。

Result: 在盲法临床阅读研究中，SiM2P将三组（阿尔茨海默病、行为变异型额颞叶痴呆、认知健康对照）的总体诊断准确率从75.0%提高到84.7%，并获得更高的诊断确定性评分和更好的评分者间一致性。

Conclusion: SiM2P框架使FDG-PET的诊断优势更易获得，有望在资源有限环境中改善痴呆症的早期检测和鉴别诊断。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史档案分析中结构化内容出现在退化、非标准形式中的挑战，包括运动模糊、手写变化、曝光波动和杂乱背景等问题。

Method: 从127个二战时期档案视频片段中提取包含拍板的数据，提供全帧标注和裁剪的单词图像，支持旋转边界框的4点多边形表示。

Result: 在零样本和微调条件下对6个识别模型和7个检测模型进行基准测试，尽管训练集较小（18个视频），微调仍带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: ClapperText为低资源档案环境中的鲁棒OCR和文档理解提供了一个现实且文化基础的数据集资源。

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The

Conclusion: 提出的视觉引导3D布局生成系统能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，生成艺术性和连贯的3D场景布局。

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 现有DeepFake检测方法在真实世界条件下难以处理姿态变化、遮挡和难以检测的伪影问题。

Method: 集成三个专用编码器：全局视角检测边界不一致性，中观视角分析纹理和颜色对齐，局部视角捕捉眼睛、鼻子和嘴巴等表情区域的失真。还加入了面部朝向编码器来分类面部姿态。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于传统的单视角方法。

Conclusion: 通过融合多个编码器的特征，该模型在检测篡改图像方面实现了优越性能，即使在具有挑战性的姿态和光照条件下也能有效工作。

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Result: 参数从4180万减少到约9000个，性能更优，训练更快，内存使用更低。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅是有效的模态转换工具，还能作为实验准确性和图像保真度的验证工具。

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

Motivation: 为了促进时空图像融合方法的应用，需要解决不同传感器图像空间和光谱分辨率不匹配的问题。

Method: 第一种方法是传统上采样方法，第二种是ABSIS锐化方法，将精细分辨率图像的整体特征与特定粗分辨率图像的独特属性相结合。

Result: 两种方法都显著提升了USTFIP方法的准确性，锐化方法使融合图像的光谱和空间准确性分别提高了49.46%和78.40%。

Conclusion: 提出的标准化方法有效提升了时空图像融合的性能，特别是ABSIS锐化方法表现更优。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible
framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb,
infrared, sketches, and text. FlexiReID introduces an adaptive
mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality
features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four
modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves
state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
in the field.

Result: 在两个公共超声数据集BUSI和UNS上的实验表明，该方法性能与全监督方法相当甚至更好，同时显著降低标注成本。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督框架在超声图像分割中具有有效性和实用性，能够在显著减少标注成本的同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel dataset aimed at detecting pedestrians'
intentions as they approach an ego-vehicle. The dataset comprises synchronized
multi-modal data, including fisheye camera feeds, lidar laser scans, ultrasonic
sensor readings, and motion capture-based 3D body poses, collected across
diverse real-world scenarios. Key contributions include detailed annotations of

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了UniMedVL，首个医疗统一多模态模型，能够在单一架构中同时处理图像理解和生成任务，解决了现有医疗AI系统将这两种能力分离的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗AI系统破坏了统一诊断流程：图像理解模型只能解释图像但不能生成视觉输出，而图像生成模型只能合成图像但不能提供文本解释，导致数据表示、特征集成和多模态能力方面的差距。

Method: 采用观察-知识-分析(OKA)范式：观察层面构建包含560万样本的UniMed-5M数据集；知识层面提出渐进式课程学习；分析层面开发UniMedVL统一多模态模型。

Result: UniMedVL在五个医疗图像理解基准测试中表现优异，同时在八种医疗成像模态的生成质量上与专门模型相当。双向知识共享使生成任务增强了视觉理解特征。

Conclusion: 在单一医疗框架中整合传统分离的能力，能够在多样化的医疗视觉语言任务中实现全面改进，证明了统一架构的价值。

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在档案影片分析中，由于噪声、缺失帧和低对比度等问题，传统相机运动分类模型性能下降的问题

Method: 构建统一基准数据集，并在Video Swin Transformer基础上引入方向性网格运动编码，通过可学习的后期融合层注入光学流信息

Result: 在现代片段上将top-1准确率从81.78%提升到86.14%，宏F1从82.08%提升到87.81%；在二战档案片段上准确率从83.43%提升到84.62%，宏F1从81.72%提升到82.63%

Conclusion: 结构化运动先验和transformer表示是互补的，即使小规模精心校准的运动头也能显著增强退化影片分析的鲁棒性

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用单步推理框架，缺乏基于反馈的自校正机制，在面对复杂元素布局规划时失败率显著增加。

Method: SEGA采用分层推理框架：粗粒度模块粗略估计布局规划结果，然后精炼模块对粗规划结果进行细粒度推理，并融入布局设计原则作为先验知识。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的结果，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SEGA通过分层推理和融入设计原则，显著提升了内容感知布局生成的性能，特别是在复杂布局规划场景下。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了NDM框架，首个基于噪声的检测和缓解方法，用于处理文本到图像生成中的隐式恶意意图，同时保持模型生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型容易生成不当内容，特别是面对隐式性暗示提示时。现有检测方法主要针对显式内容，难以检测隐式暗示，而微调方法会降低生成质量。

Method: 提出噪声驱动的检测和缓解框架：1）利用早期预测噪声的可分离性开发基于噪声的检测方法；2）提出噪声增强的自适应负引导机制，通过抑制显著区域注意力来优化初始噪声。

Result: 在自然和对抗数据集上验证，NDM性能优于现有SOTA方法（如SLD、UCE、RECE等）。

Conclusion: NDM能有效检测和缓解隐式恶意意图，同时保持模型的原始生成能力，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and
resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当获取精细像素级标注困难或昂贵时，粗标注（如粗略标注像素，边界区域未标注）是一种替代方案。但在粗标注下训练分割模型，特别是优化类别边界对齐时存在困难

Method: 针对编码器-解码器架构，提出基于超像素的上采样正则化方法，鼓励解码图像中的分割像素形成SLIC超像素（基于像素颜色和位置，与分割标注无关）

Result: 在FCN-16架构上应用该方法，在SUIM、Cityscapes和PanNuke数据集上评估，相比最先进模型，边界召回率显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法在粗标注条件下有效改善了语义分割模型的边界对齐性能

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

Method: 结合了每样本微钳制来温和限制极端值，以及自适应分位数裁剪(AQClip)来根据局部结构统计或注意力熵自适应调整允许值范围。

Result: 在SD/SDXL骨干网络上获得了一致的定性改进，在低步数和高分辨率下产生更清晰、更锐利的结果，且与CFG/Rescale有协同效应。

Conclusion: QSilk提供了一种无需训练的高效稳定解决方案，显著提升了潜在扩散模型的渲染质量，计算开销可忽略不计。

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

Result: 在DeformingThings4D和D-FAUST数据集上超越现有最佳方法，速度提升4倍以上

Conclusion: ERNet能够有效处理噪声和部分输入，利用时序信息实现准确一致的序列配准，在精度和效率方面均有显著优势

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

Method: VISTA采用多代理系统：首先将用户想法分解为结构化时间计划，生成后通过成对锦标赛选择最佳视频，然后由专注于视觉、音频和上下文保真度的专业代理进行评审，最后由推理代理综合反馈重写提示进行下一轮生成。

Result: 在单场景和多场景视频生成实验中，VISTA持续提升视频质量和用户意图对齐度，相比最先进基线方法获得高达60%的成对胜率。人类评估者更偏好VISTA输出，在66.4%的比较中选择VISTA。

Conclusion: VISTA通过自主迭代改进机制，显著提升了文本到视频生成的质量和与用户意图的一致性，在多场景视频生成中表现尤为突出。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

### [82] [Neuro-Symbolic Spatial Reasoning in Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15841)
*Jiayi Lin,Jiabo Huang,Shaogang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RelateSeg是首个在开放词汇语义分割中引入神经符号空间推理的方法，通过一阶逻辑公式在神经网络架构中施加空间关系约束，提升对多类别图像的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于视觉语言模型的方法缺乏对场景中物体空间关系的理解，导致在开放词汇语义分割中性能受限。

Method: 提出RelateSeg方法，自动提取空间关系（如<猫，在右侧，人>），将其编码为一阶逻辑公式，通过伪类别同时预测语义类别和空间伪类别，使用模糊逻辑松弛在深度网络中实现端到端学习。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上实现了最先进的平均mIoU性能，特别是在包含多个类别的图像上表现出明显优势，仅引入单个辅助损失函数且无额外参数。

Conclusion: 神经符号空间推理在开放词汇语义分割中具有有效性，RelateSeg通过空间关系约束显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPR提出了一种基于图像的重新照明模型，利用从光舞台捕获的多视图单光时序图像中学习到的生成先验，实现了从单张人像输入生成新颖、重新照明的视图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单张人像输入渲染新颖、重新照明的视图是一个高度欠约束的问题。传统图形学方法通过可微分渲染将输入图像分解为几何、材质和光照，但受限于底层模型的假设和参数化近似。

Method: 利用预训练生成头部模型的潜在空间提供丰富的面部几何先验，通过编码器反演将输入人像嵌入潜在流形。然后使用基于三平面的反射率网络合成高质量OLAT图像，实现基于图像的重新照明。

Result: 3DPR在定量和定性评估中优于先前方法，特别是在保持身份特征和捕捉光照效果（如镜面反射、自阴影和次表面散射）方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法结合生成先验和光舞台数据，实现了物理准确的环境重新照明效果，为单张人像的重新照明提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

TL;DR: 提出Memory-SAM，一种无需训练、无需人工提示的舌像分割方法，通过检索历史案例自动生成有效提示来指导SAM2模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督模型需要大量标注数据，而SAM系列模型仍需人工提示。需要一种数据高效且无需人工干预的舌像分割方法

Method: 使用DINOv3特征和FAISS检索构建小型记忆库，通过掩码约束对应关系从检索样本中提取前景/背景点提示，自动指导SAM2进行分割

Result: 在600张专家标注图像上测试，混合测试集的mIoU达到0.9863，优于FCN(0.8188)和检测器到框SAM基线(0.1839)

Conclusion: 检索到提示的方法能够实现数据高效、鲁棒的舌像不规则边界分割，在真实世界条件下表现优异

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

TL;DR: BLIP3o-NEXT是一个完全开源的图像生成基础模型，统一了文本到图像生成和图像编辑功能，采用自回归+扩散架构，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动原生图像生成的前沿发展，将文本到图像生成和图像编辑统一到单一架构中，解决图像编辑任务的挑战性。

Method: 采用自回归+扩散混合架构：自回归模型首先生成离散图像token，其隐藏状态作为扩散模型的调节信号来生成高保真图像。

Result: 在多个文本到图像和图像编辑基准测试中，BLIP3o-NEXT实现了优于现有模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 架构选择的关键在于可扩展性和快速推理能力；强化学习能推动性能边界；数据质量和规模是决定模型性能上限的决定性因素；混合架构结合了自回归模型的推理能力和扩散模型的细节渲染能力。

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

Motivation: 镜头眩光严重降低图像质量，影响关键计算机视觉任务如目标检测和自动驾驶。现有的单图像眩光去除方法在画面外光源不完整或缺失时表现不佳。

Method: 提出LightsOut框架，利用多任务回归模块和LoRA微调的扩散模型，确保实现真实且物理一致的外绘结果。

Result: 综合实验表明，LightsOut能够持续提升现有SIFR方法在挑战性场景下的性能，无需额外重新训练。

Abstract: Lens flare significantly degrades image quality, impacting critical computer

framework tailored to enhance SIFR by reconstructing off-frame light sources.
Our method leverages a multitask regression module and LoRA fine-tuned

Conclusion: Skyfall-GS是首个无需昂贵3D标注即可创建城市街区尺度3D场景的框架，支持实时沉浸式3D探索。

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures
compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Project page:

Motivation: 推进机器智能需要发展像人类一样感知多模态信息的能力，因此需要构建强大的开源多模态大语言模型。

Method: 提出了三个关键创新：OmniAlignNet用于增强视觉和音频嵌入在多模态潜在空间中的对齐；时间嵌入分组用于捕捉视觉和音频信号的相对时间对齐；约束旋转时间嵌入用于在多模态嵌入中编码绝对时间信息。同时引入了生成2400万单模态和多模态对话的数据管理流程。

Result: OmniVinci在DailyOmni（跨模态理解）上比Qwen2.5-Omni高出19.05分，在MMAR（音频）上高出1.7分，在Video-MME（视觉）上高出3.9分，而训练token数量仅为0.2T，是Qwen2.5-Omni（1.2T）的1/6。

Conclusion: 多模态在感知和推理中相互增强，OmniVinci在机器人、医疗AI和智能工厂等下游应用中展示了多模态优势。

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive
across multiple modalities, much as humans sense the world. We introduce
OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

Method: 基于形成性研究设计了思维交换界面，在46名初级研究人员中评估了无代理、单代理和多代理三种条件下的思维交换效果。

Result: 代理介导的思维交换显著提高了批判性思维分数；单代理条件下参与者更频繁做反思性标注；多代理条件下参与者更积极参与代理回应。

Abstract: Critical reading is a primary way through which researchers develop their
critical thinking skills. While exchanging thoughts and opinions with peers can
strengthen critical reading, junior researchers often lack access to peers who
can offer diverse perspectives. To address this gap, we designed an in-situ
thought exchange interface informed by peer feedback from a formative study
(N=8) to support junior researchers' critical paper reading. We evaluated the
effects of thought exchanges under three conditions (no-agent, single-agent,
and multi-agent) with 46 junior researchers over two weeks. Our results showed
that incorporating agent-mediated thought exchanges during paper reading
significantly improved participants' critical thinking scores compared to the
no-agent condition. In the single-agent condition, participants more frequently
made reflective annotations on the paper content. In the multi-agent condition,
participants engaged more actively with agents' responses. Our qualitative
analysis further revealed that participants compared and analyzed multiple
perspectives in the multi-agent condition. This work contributes to
understanding in-situ AI-based support for critical paper reading through
thought exchanges and offers design implications for future research.

Abstract: Healthcare professionals have limited time to support patients and their
relatives, but their information needs are high. Therefore, the Radboud
University together with the Canisius Wilhelmina Hospital hospital developed a
speaking virtual hu-man avatar which, contrary to many avatars, uses a Large
Language Model (LLM) enhanced with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The
RAG tech-nique enables medical information supplied by the hospital to be
utilized during interactions, rather than generic LLM information. Two videos
were produced, one presenting a patient-avatar interaction regarding a total
hip surgery, and an-other one presenting an interaction between a relative of a
patient and the avatar concerning postoperative delirium. A survey was
conducted among adults over 40 from the Netherlands, the UK and the USA to
study the effects of gender, country and education level on usability and
trust, which are important factors for avatar acceptance. Participants watched
videos, imagining themselves as the pa-tient (video 1) or relative (video 2),
and rated the constructs on a 7-point Likert scale (0-6). 165 persons
(MeanAge=51.6, SDAge=8.9, Male=80, Female=85) completed the survey. In the
patient role, participants scored the usability as M=4.61 (SD=0.97) and trust
as M=3.92 (SD=1.10), all above the mean scale value. In the role as relative to
the patient, participants scored usability as M=4.64 (SD=1.08) and trust as
M=4.31 (SD=1.06). No effects were found of gender, country and education level.

intentionally diversify agent behaviour within a multi-agent workflow. This
white paper documents the problem framing, experimental design, and
quantitative evidence behind the Spark agent programme. Using an LLM-as-a-judge
protocol calibrated against human gold standards, we observe a mean diversity
gain of +4.1 points (on a 1-10 scale) when persona-conditioned Spark agents
replace a uniform system prompt, narrowing the gap to human experts to 1.0
point. We also surface evaluator bias and procedural considerations for future
deployments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can find an optimal policy for a
single agent to accomplish a particular task. However, many real-world problems
require multiple agents to collaborate in order to achieve a common goal. For
example, a robot executing a task in a warehouse may require the assistance of
a drone to retrieve items from high shelves. In Decentralized Multi-Agent RL
(DMARL), agents learn independently and then combine their policies at
execution time, but often must satisfy constraints on compatibility of local
policies to ensure that they can achieve the global task when combined. In this
paper, we study how providing high-level symbolic knowledge to agents can help
address unique challenges of this setting, such as privacy constraints,
communication limitations, and performance concerns. In particular, we extend
the formal tools used to check the compatibility of local policies with the
team task, making decentralized training with theoretical guarantees usable in
more scenarios. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that symbolic knowledge
about the temporal evolution of events in the environment can significantly
expedite the learning process in DMARL.

Result: 区域预测的准确性和可解释性得到改善，节点预测有显著改进，运营商能够以前所未有的置信度和准确性调整预测，并精确诊断原本不透明的错误。

Conclusion: 多级预测系统使输电系统运营商能够逐步将区域运营扩展到包含节点预测，有效应对电力负荷的异质性和波动性挑战。

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

TL;DR: 提出了TangledFeatures框架，用于在相关特征空间中进行特征选择，通过识别纠缠预测因子组中的代表性特征来减少冗余同时保留解释能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法主要关注预测准确性，但在存在相关预测因子的情况下性能会下降，需要一种能够处理相关特征空间的方法。

Method: TangledFeatures框架识别相关特征组中的代表性特征，减少冗余同时保持解释力，所选特征子集可直接用于下游模型。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide数据集上应用该框架预测主链扭转角，所选特征对应于结构上有意义的原子间距离，能够解释这些角度的变化。

Conclusion: TangledFeatures提供了比传统选择技术更可解释和稳定的分析基础，在相关特征空间中表现出有效性。

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

*Rijul Tandon,Peter Vamplew,Cameron Foale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了ES-C51算法，通过将C51分布强化学习中的贪婪Q学习更新替换为Expected Sarsa更新，使用softmax结合所有动作信息，解决了当动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于值的RL算法只估计期望奖励，而分布强化学习估计整个奖励概率分布。但C51算法使用贪婪Q学习更新，当多个动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时，会导致分布学习不稳定。

Method: 修改C51算法，用Expected Sarsa更新替代贪婪Q学习更新，使用softmax计算结合所有可能动作的信息，而不是仅依赖单个最佳动作。

Result: 在Gym经典控制环境和Atari-10游戏中评估，ES-C51在多数环境中表现优于使用softmax探索的QL-C51（标准C51的修改版本）。

Conclusion: ES-C51通过Expected Sarsa更新有效解决了分布学习的不稳定性问题，能够学习到更高性能的策略。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
profitability.

Motivation: 现有基于最优传输的流生成模型方法使用小批量采样来估计传输计划，这限制了其在大规模高维数据集上的可扩展性。

Method: 利用半离散最优传输将噪声空间划分为Laguerre单元，每个单元映射到对应的数据点，在训练过程中通过SDOT映射将独立同分布的噪声样本与数据点配对。

Conclusion: AlignFlow是一种可即插即用的组件，通过半离散最优传输有效改善了流生成模型的训练效果和可扩展性。

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

Motivation: 信用评分是金融服务中的高风险任务，需要透明度和可信度，但量子机器学习(QML)的黑盒特性阻碍了其在监管严格领域的应用

Method: 开发IQNN-CS框架，结合变分量子神经网络和事后解释技术，引入Inter-Class Attribution Alignment(ICAA)指标量化不同预测类别间的归因差异

Result: 在两个真实信用数据集上的评估显示，IQNN-CS具有稳定的训练动态、有竞争力的预测性能和增强的可解释性

Conclusion: 为金融决策提供了透明和可问责的QML模型的实用路径

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a
practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial
decision-making.

TL;DR: SPA框架通过自监督微调学习世界模型，然后用于策略优化，显著提升LLM智能体在分布外场景中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在分布外场景中表现不佳，难以将内部知识与环境动态对齐，传统RL训练难以扩展且泛化能力有限

Method: 将世界模型分解为状态表示和转移建模，通过自博弈监督微调阶段冷启动策略学习世界模型，然后用于模拟未来状态进行策略优化

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和Sudoku等环境中显著提升性能，Sokoban成功率从25.6%提升至59.8%，FrozenLake得分从22.1%提升至70.9%

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体配备内部世界模型能更好地对齐推理与环境动态，改善决策能力，SPA框架简单有效且优于在线世界建模基线

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习假设环境固定不变，但实际中智能体可能具有主动修改环境模型的能力，通过重新配置底层转移过程来获得更高奖励。

Method: 构建了双层MDP框架：上层MDP包含模型修改动作，可以配置底层MDP的非平稳转移函数；下层MDP执行常规动作。智能体需要联合优化上层配置策略和下层动作策略。

Result: 提出了MCTVMDP理论框架，为智能体主动修改环境模型的研究提供了数学基础。

Conclusion: MCTVMDP扩展了传统RL框架，使智能体能够主动修改环境动态，为更灵活的智能体设计开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

TL;DR: Antislop框架通过采样器、自动化管道和FTPO微调方法，有效检测和消除LLM输出中的重复短语模式（slop），在保持模型性能的同时显著减少slop出现频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM广泛采用导致输出中出现特征性的重复短语模式（slop），这降低了输出质量并使AI生成文本容易被识别，需要有效的方法来检测和消除这些模式。

Method: 结合三个创新方法：Antislop采样器（使用回溯抑制不想要的字符串）、自动化管道（分析模型特定slop并生成训练数据）、FTPO微调方法（在单个token级别调整logits）。

Result: Antislop采样器成功抑制8000+模式且保持质量，而token禁止在2000模式时就不可用；FTPO实现90%的slop减少，在GSM8K、MMLU和创意写作任务中保持或提升性能。

Conclusion: Antislop框架能有效减少LLM输出中的slop模式，同时保持模型性能，相比DPO方法在写作质量和词汇多样性方面表现更优。

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

Method: 通过整合物理信息数据驱动的结构尺寸预测模型与统计方法，提出了三种能够处理不同泛化水平复杂场景的方法。收集了包含6种工艺参数组合和6种结构尺寸在两种机器健康状态下的综合实验数据集进行评估。

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机源于离线的相关聚类可以同时近似所有ℓ_p-范数，但标准随机顺序在线模型存在根本性分离：ℓ_1-范数可轻松近似，而公平性导向的ℓ_∞-范数需要至少Ω(n^{1/3})的竞争比，因此需要超越最坏情况的模型。

Method: 采用在线带样本(AOS)模型，给定输入的一小部分常数比例作为样本，设计单一算法同时处理所有ℓ_p-范数目标。

Result: 算法在AOS模型中：以高概率对所有ℓ_p-范数同时达到O(log⁴ n)竞争比；以高概率对ℓ_∞-范数达到O(log n)竞争比；对ℓ_1-范数在期望下达到O(1)竞争比。

Conclusion: 成功将离线的"全范数"保证扩展到在线世界，证明了AOS模型的必要性，并通过下界证明所获竞争比在AOS模型中近乎最优。

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

Conclusion: TempO模型为高维PDE动力学预测提供了高效、准确的解决方案，特别在长期物理一致性预测方面表现出色。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge
for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches
often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency

Motivation: 现有推理语言模型虽然性能强大，但经常生成不必要的冗长输出，最大化每个token的智能（准确率相对于响应长度）仍然是一个开放问题。

Method: 提出DLER训练方法，结合批处理奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样和简单的截断长度惩罚，解决强化学习优化中的三个关键挑战：优势估计偏差大、熵崩溃和稀疏奖励信号。

Result: DLER将输出长度减少70%以上，同时超过所有先前基线准确率。与DeepSeek-R1-7B相比，DLER-7B生成多个简洁响应，准确率提高28%，延迟更低。

Conclusion: DLER证明了通过适当的强化学习优化，简单的长度惩罚就能有效提升推理语言模型的效率，同时保持或提高准确性，为实际应用提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

*Alex Shtoff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图拉普拉斯算子的非参数概率质量函数估计方法，通过数据依赖的低通滤波处理多模态和重尾分布，计算高效且无需大量调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大规模离散支撑集上的多模态、重尾概率质量函数估计问题，传统方法在处理噪声和保持粗粒度结构方面存在挑战。

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图上的信号，构建对称三对角算子（路径图拉普拉斯算子加上经验PMF构建的对角矩阵），计算最小特征值对应的特征向量，将经验PMF投影到低维子空间进行平滑估计。

Result: 在合成和真实重尾数据上，该方法能有效保持粗粒度结构并抑制采样噪声，在目标场景下优于logspline和高斯KDE基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简洁、计算可靠、内存和时间效率高，适合自动化流水线和大规模探索性分析，但存在已知的失败模式（如突然的不连续性）。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

Motivation: 研究恐怖主义事件周计数的短期预测，使用全球恐怖主义数据库（GTD）数据，旨在建立一个可重复的预测管道并评估深度学习模型相对于传统方法的性能。

Method: 构建了基于固定时间分割的可重复管道，评估双向LSTM（BiLSTM）模型，并与季节性朴素模型、线性/ARIMA模型以及LSTM-Attention基线进行比较。进行了消融实验研究时间记忆、训练历史长度、空间粒度、回看窗口大小和特征组的影响。

Result: BiLSTM在测试集上达到RMSE 6.38，显著优于LSTM-Attention（9.19，提升30.6%）和线性滞后回归基线（RMSE提升35.4%）。长期历史数据训练效果最佳，中等回看窗口（20-30周）提供强上下文，双向编码对捕捉窗口内的累积和后续模式至关重要。

Conclusion: 该研究为GTD事件预测提供了一个透明、超越基线的参考框架，显示双向LSTM在恐怖主义事件短期预测中的有效性，特别是结合长期历史数据和适当回看窗口时表现最佳。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

Method: 使用统计物理方法推导贝叶斯后验的自洽平均场理论，分析网络在有限宽度下的对称性破缺相变。

Conclusion: 自增强输入特征选择是特征学习的关键机制，改进的平均场理论能提供对特征学习的机理理解。

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

Motivation: 传统工具如DXA T-score和FRAX在髋部骨折风险评估中缺乏敏感性，特别是对无既往骨折或骨量减少的高风险人群识别不足。

Method: 采用顺序两阶段模型：第一阶段使用临床、人口统计学和功能变量进行筛查，第二阶段结合DXA衍生特征进行精炼。使用MrOS、SOF和UK Biobank数据进行验证。

Result: 模型在内部和外部验证中表现一致，相比T-score和FRAX具有更高敏感性和更少的漏诊病例。

Conclusion: 该两阶段框架提供了一种成本效益高且个性化的早期髋部骨折风险评估方法。

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

Motivation: Mahalanobis距离方法广泛用于OOD检测，但其性能受表示几何和归一化的影响尚未完全理解，这限制了其下游应用。

Method: 在多样化图像基础模型、数据集和距离归一化方案上进行全面实证研究，分析表示几何与OOD性能的关系，并提出径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法。

Result: 研究发现谱度和内在维度指标能准确预测模型的OOD性能，提出的径向缩放ℓ2归一化通过可调参数控制特征空间的径向几何，显著改善了OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过桥接表示几何、归一化和OOD性能之间的差距，为设计更有效可靠的深度学习模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令对于其可控性、透明度和安全性至关重要，可以避免不良捷径、幻觉或奖励黑客等风险。

Method: 构建了ReasonIF基准，包含多语言推理、格式控制和长度控制等六类指令提示，评估多个开源LRM的推理指令遵循能力，并探索了多轮推理和推理指令微调(RIF)两种改进策略。

Result: 现有开源LRM在推理指令遵循方面表现严重不足，最高指令遵循得分(IFS)低于0.25；任务难度增加时表现进一步下降；RIF方法将GPT-OSS-20B的IFS从0.11提升到0.27。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循指令的能力存在显著不足，需要进一步研究和改进，RIF方法显示出一定效果但仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

Conclusion: BREEZE通过增强学习稳定性、策略提取能力和表示学习质量，有效解决了零样本RL中的关键挑战，为通用策略学习提供了改进方案。

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available

Motivation: 探究为什么不同基础模型在RLVR后表现差异巨大，寻找预训练模型的微观特性如何影响其推理能力。

Method: 将推理形式化为Horn子句链，使用跨层稀疏自编码器从LLM潜在空间提取特征，估计特征间转移概率，并用LLM对规则进行语义正确性分类。引入SAL指标测量不同正确性级别规则分布间的分离程度。

Result: 发现高潜力模型具有内在的正确性感知能力，其内部概率分布在严格规则与噪声规则间显著分离，而较弱模型则对所有规则都收敛到同一分布。SAL指标能准确预测模型在RLVR后的推理表现（R^2=0.87）。

Conclusion: 模型的推理潜力与其预训练时区分正确与错误知识的内在能力紧密相关，这强调了模型预训练在塑造推理能力中的关键作用，并为选择和设计更强基础模型提供了实用指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

### [122] [Machine Learning for Early Detection of Meningitis: Stacked Ensemble Learning with EHR data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15218)
*Han Ouyang,Jesse Hamilton,Saeed Amal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用MIMIC-III数据库中的214名脑膜炎患者和46,303名非脑膜炎患者数据，通过集成学习方法构建脑膜炎诊断模型，在模拟急诊室场景下取得了优异的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够在真实急诊室场景下应用的脑膜炎AI诊断工具，提高临床诊断效率和准确性。

Method: 采用两阶段特征选择方法筛选临床相关特征，使用随机森林、LightGBM和深度神经网络作为基础模型，通过堆叠集成学习方法将基础模型输出作为元模型（逻辑回归）的输入进行训练。

Result: 集成学习模型在两个测试集上均表现出色，测试集1的AUC为0.9637，测试集2的AUC为0.9472。

Conclusion: 虽然直接将诊断工具部署供临床医生使用仍具挑战性，但本研究为未来基于集成学习的AI驱动脑膜炎诊断方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

TL;DR: 该研究通过将乘积系数与自编码器表示和KNN分类器结合，在3D LiDAR点云分类中实现了比PCA基线和先前框架更一致的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展先前关于使用乘积系数增强3D LiDAR点云分类的研究，探索结合自编码器表示是否能进一步提升性能。

Method: 将乘积系数与自编码器表示相结合，使用KNN分类器进行点云分类，并逐层添加乘积系数分析其影响。

Result: 更丰富的乘积系数集合系统性地提高了类别可分性和整体准确率，组合分层乘积系数特征与自编码器能显著提升LiDAR分类性能。

Abstract: This work extends our previous study on enhancing 3D LiDAR point-cloud
classification with product coefficients
\cite{medina2025integratingproductcoefficientsimproved}, measure-theoretic
descriptors that complement the original spatial Lidar features. Here, we show
that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based
baselines and our earlier framework. We also investigate the effect of adding
product coefficients level by level, revealing a clear trend: richer sets of
coefficients systematically improve class separability and overall accuracy.
The results highlight the value of combining hierarchical product-coefficient

### [125] [Stress-Aware Learning under KL Drift via Trust-Decayed Mirror Descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15222)
*Gabriel Nixon Raj*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出熵正则化信任衰减方法，在分布漂移下进行顺序决策，通过压力感知指数倾斜实现鲁棒性，获得O(√T)动态遗憾保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在分布漂移下的顺序决策问题，传统方法在分布变化时性能下降，需要开发对分布漂移具有鲁棒性的决策框架。

Method: 提出熵正则化信任衰减方法，在信念更新和镜像下降决策中注入压力感知指数倾斜，建立Fenchel对偶等价性，并定义鲁棒性度量指标。

Result: 证明了高概率敏感性边界，在KL漂移路径长度ST下获得O(√T)动态遗憾保证，实现O(1)每切换遗憾，而无压力更新会导致Ω(1)尾部风险。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了动态遗憾分析、分布鲁棒目标和KL正则化控制，提供了一种单一的压力自适应更新方法，可扩展到二阶更新、老虎机反馈等多种场景。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FinTrust是一个专门用于评估LLMs在金融应用中可信度的综合基准，涵盖多个对齐维度的细粒度任务。评估发现专有模型在安全性等方面表现更好，开源模型在特定领域有优势，但所有模型在法律意识方面都存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于金融领域的高风险和高利害属性，在真实金融应用中部署LLMs具有挑战性，需要评估其可信度。

Method: 开发FinTrust基准，基于实际情境设计广泛的对齐问题，为每个可信度评估维度创建细粒度任务。

Result: 评估11个LLMs显示：专有模型（如o4-mini）在安全性等多数任务中表现更好；开源模型（如DeepSeek-V3）在行业级公平性等特定领域有优势；所有模型在信托责任对齐和披露等挑战性任务中表现不佳，法律意识存在显著差距。

Conclusion: FinTrust可作为金融领域LLMs可信度评估的有价值基准，当前LLMs在法律意识方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related
problems. However, applying LLMs in real-world finance application remains
challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

### [127] [Adaptive Individual Uncertainty under Out-Of-Distribution Shift with Expert-Routed Conformal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15233)
*Amitesh Badkul,Lei Xie*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TESSERA是一种新的不确定性量化方法，结合专家混合模型和保形校准，为蛋白质-配体亲和力预测提供可靠、信息丰富且自适应的预测区间，在分布偏移下保持接近名义覆盖率和最佳覆盖-宽度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习社区缺乏可靠、信息丰富且个体化的不确定性量化方法，这阻碍了AI/ML在风险敏感领域的有效应用。特别是在药物发现中的蛋白质-配体亲和力预测，面临检测噪声异质性、化学空间不平衡和分布偏移等挑战。

Method: TESSERA结合专家混合模型的多样性和保形校准，提供每个样本的不确定性，具有可靠的覆盖保证、信息丰富且自适应的预测区间宽度，能够追踪绝对误差。

Result: 在独立同分布和支架外分布分割下，TESSERA达到接近名义覆盖率，在覆盖-宽度标准上表现最佳，同时保持竞争性的适应性（最低稀疏化误差下面积）。大小分层覆盖确认区间大小合适。

Conclusion: TESSERA通过统一专家混合模型多样性和保形校准，提供可信赖、紧凑且自适应的不确定性，适用于药物发现管道和其他应用中的选择性预测和下游决策。

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了双权重强化学习（DWRL）框架，将思维链推理与Bradley-Terry模型结合，用于非可验证任务的人类偏好建模，通过实例级和组级权重优化偏好学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在可验证任务上有效扩展思维链推理，但在非可验证的人类偏好任务中应用仍具挑战且研究不足。

Method: DWRL框架通过双权重RL目标整合思维链推理与BT模型：实例级错位权重强调未训练好的偏好对，组级条件偏好分数促进有前景的思考。训练生成偏好模型先产生思考再预测人类偏好分数。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型规模（Llama3、Qwen2.5）上，DWRL持续优于GPM基线和标量模型，同时产生连贯、可解释的思考。

Conclusion: DWRL作为推理增强偏好学习的通用框架，可扩展到可验证任务之外的非可验证偏好建模领域。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的框架，利用候鸟迁徙轨迹预测终点疾病风险，整合GPS追踪、疫情记录和地理空间数据，在测试集上取得高精度预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测禽类疾病暴发对野生动物保护和公共卫生至关重要，需要开发能够利用候鸟迁徙模式进行疾病风险预测的早期预警系统。

Method: 整合多源数据集（Movebank GPS追踪数据、WOAH疫情记录、GADM和Natural Earth地理空间数据），使用H3分层地理空间编码处理坐标，基于Transformer架构学习时空依赖关系来估计终点疾病风险。

Result: 在测试集上表现出色：准确率0.9821、ROC曲线下面积0.9803、平均精度0.9299、F1分数0.8836，证明了模型强大的预测能力。

Conclusion: Transformer架构在禽类疾病监测早期预警系统中具有巨大潜力，能够支持及时干预和预防策略的实施。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These
results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support
early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely
intervention and prevention strategies.

### [130] [DRO-InstructZero: Distributionally Robust Prompt Optimization for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15260)
*Yangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero通过分布鲁棒优化方法改进零样本提示优化，在分布偏移和对抗评估中显著提升性能，同时保持查询效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动提示搜索方法在分布偏移和对抗评估中性能下降的问题，因为这些方法只优化单一评估分布下的期望性能。

Method: 将零样本提示优化建模为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布的模糊集，通过鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用。

Result: 在形式化重写任务中准确率从61.3%提升至85-90%，代码调试在域偏移下提升约25个百分点，稳定任务保持96%以上性能。

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习结合，为现实世界不确定性下的可靠、可迁移提示对齐提供即插即用的通用方法。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

### [131] [Robust Layerwise Scaling Rules by Proper Weight Decay Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15262)
*Zhiyuan Fan,Yifeng Liu,Qingyue Zhao,Angela Yuan,Quanquan Gu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AdamW优化器的权重衰减缩放规则，解决了μP在稳态训练中学习率宽度依赖性问题，实现了跨宽度的零-shot超参数迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代尺度不变架构中，训练快速进入优化器主导的稳态，归一化层造成反向尺度敏感性，导致有效学习率变得宽度依赖，破坏了μP的跨宽度学习率迁移能力。

Method: 引入AdamW的权重衰减缩放规则，保持子层增益跨宽度不变。通过观察矩阵参数奇异值谱的缩放规律，提出经验性权重衰减缩放规则λ₂∝√d，与μP学习率规则η₂∝d⁻¹结合，实现子层增益宽度不变。

Result: 在LLaMA风格Transformer和最小合成设置中验证了该规则，提供了匹配顶部奇异值的简单诊断方法，成功实现了学习率和权重衰减的零-shot跨宽度迁移。

Conclusion: 该研究通过显式控制优化器设定的稳态尺度，将μP扩展到近初始化阶段之外，为AdamW下的宽度鲁棒超参数迁移提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

TL;DR: RIC-TSC框架将因果发现融入时间序列分类，通过区域特定的因果图提升冰川湖演化预测的泛化能力，在分布外评估中比相关性方法准确率提高12.59%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前地球观测中的时空模型过度依赖相关性特征，在异质域间迁移性差。因果建模能发现稳定不变的关系，提升模型在分布变化下的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Method: 提出RIC-TSC框架，使用J-PCMCI+进行区域特定的因果发现，结合多模态卫星数据（Sentinel-1/2、Landsat-8、CARRA气象变量），将验证的因果预测因子及其时间滞后输入轻量级分类器。

Result: 在两个对比融季（2018-2019）的1000个手动标记冰川湖数据集上，因果模型在分布外评估中比基于相关性的基线准确率提高达12.59%。

Conclusion: 因果发现不仅是特征选择工具，更是构建可泛化、机制基础的地球表面动态过程模型的途径。

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督回归中连续输出和异方差噪声使得伪标签可靠性难以评估，简单的伪标签方法会导致错误累积和过拟合。

Result: 在多个基准半监督回归数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法具有更好的鲁棒性和性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的不确定性感知伪标签框架能有效缓解不可靠伪标签的影响，在半监督回归任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个三阶段框架来描述基础模型如何推动科学范式的转变：从增强传统工作流程，到人机协作，再到自主科学发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨基础模型（如GPT-4、AlphaFold）是否仅仅是增强现有科学方法，还是正在重新定义科学实践方式。

Method: 引入三阶段演化框架：元科学整合、混合人机协同创造、自主科学发现，并回顾当前应用和新兴能力。

Result: 识别了基础模型在科学发现中的风险和未来方向，支持科学界理解其变革性作用。

Conclusion: 基础模型正在催化向新科学范式的过渡，需要反思科学发现的未来。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集合数据同化方法在分析精度和计算效率之间存在权衡，大集合规模提高精度但增加计算成本。

Method: 使用较小集合规模的EnKF生成初步分析状态，然后用全连接神经网络学习并预测修正项来弥补小集合带来的性能下降。

Result: 在Lorenz系统和非线性海洋波场模拟实验中，新方法相比传统EnKF在相同集合规模下获得更高精度，且额外计算成本可忽略。

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN方法通过机器学习增强传统数据同化，在保持计算效率的同时显著提高精度，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Motivation: 现有聚类联邦学习方法依赖中央服务器，存在瓶颈和单点故障问题，限制了在真实去中心化场景中的应用。

Result: 在各种数据集上的实验表明，DFCA优于其他去中心化算法，性能与集中式IFCA相当，在稀疏连接下仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DFCA展示了在动态真实世界去中心化网络中应用的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了可学习激活函数的随机特征模型(RFLAF)的泛化性质，通过数据依赖的采样方案显著提高了特征数量的边界，在回归和分类任务中都取得了最尖锐的边界结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RFLAF模型的泛化性质，旨在通过数据依赖的采样方案减少所需的特征数量，提高模型效率。

Method: 采用数据依赖的采样方案生成特征，包括普通采样方案和杠杆加权方案，并提出算法来寻找近似核并应用杠杆加权采样。

Result: 通过加权采样，MSE损失情况下的特征数边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进为Ω̃((1/ε)^{1/t})，当Gram矩阵有有限秩时甚至可达到Ω(1)；对于Lipschitz损失，边界从Ω(1/ε²)改进为Ω̃((1/ε²)^{1/t})。

Conclusion: 加权RFLAF在显著减少特征数量的情况下仍能达到相同性能，验证了理论的有效性和该方法的优越性。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络防御方法通常只针对单一攻击类型，缺乏同时防御多种威胁的统一方法，需要开发能够应对多种对抗攻击的通用防御框架。

Method: 使用Mixture of Experts架构，设计基于互信息的逻辑多样性损失使专家关注不同邻域结构，并引入鲁棒性感知路由器识别扰动模式并自适应路由节点到相应鲁棒专家。

Result: 在各种对抗设置下的广泛实验表明，该方法在抵御多种图对抗攻击方面始终表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的MoE框架为图神经网络提供了可扩展的统一防御方案，能够有效同时应对后门攻击、边操纵和节点注入等多种威胁。

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: 该方法通过算子理论视角和谱分解技术，为序列建模提供了新的可扩展框架，在保持理论严谨性的同时实现了高效的学习和采样。

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Conclusion: SWFP框架通过将流匹配与JKO原理对齐，提供了一种稳定高效的预训练流策略微调方法，在机器人控制任务中表现出色。

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

Method: 首先重组并增强CALiSol和DiffMix电解质数据集，加入分子几何图表示；然后提出GeoMix框架，保持Set-SE(3)等变性，核心是专门为分子间几何消息传递设计的几何交互网络(GIN)。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅为电解质研究建立了新基准，还提供了一个通用的几何学习框架，可推进能源材料、药物开发等领域中混合物系统的建模。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical
development, and beyond.

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

Conclusion: 基于通用逼近定理的闭式Transformer公式不仅解释了'深度信念'，还为设计高效Transformer架构开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

*Nirmit Joshi,Gene Li,Siddharth Bhandari,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan,Cong Ma,Nathan Srebro*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究从正确演示中学习生成答案的问题，提出了一种基于奖励模型低基数假设的新方法，替代传统的最大似然估计方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设演示者属于低复杂度策略类，这在实际中可能不成立。本文认为奖励模型（指定哪些答案正确）属于低基数类是更弱的假设，需要开发新方法。

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文多臂老虎机中的离线模仿学习，提出了一种基于奖励模型低基数假设的新方法，学习复杂度与奖励类基数呈对数关系。

Result: 证明最大似然估计方法在这种情况下会失败，而新方法能够以对数样本复杂度成功学习。

Conclusion: 当从正确演示中学习时，需要超越传统的最大似然估计方法，考虑奖励模型的低基数特性。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于信息论的对抗性训练方法，通过最小化表示与治疗之间的互信息来消除分配偏差，实现稳定的反事实预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在存在分配偏差的情况下进行反事实预测，传统对抗性训练方法存在训练不稳定和调参负担重的问题。

Method: 学习一个随机表示Z来预测结果，同时最小化I(Z;T)，推导出可处理的变分目标上界信息项，并与监督解码器耦合。

Result: 在受控数值模拟和真实临床数据集上评估，在似然度、反事实误差和政策评估等指标上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在避免对抗性方案训练不稳定性的同时，实现了良好的反事实预测性能。

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

TL;DR: OffSim是一个基于模型的离线逆强化学习框架，直接从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励函数，无需交互式模拟器或手动定义奖励，然后离线训练策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习需要开发模拟器和手动定义奖励函数，这通常耗时费力。OffSim旨在直接从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励结构，避免这些繁琐过程。

Method: 联合优化高熵转移模型和IRL奖励函数以增强探索性；引入OffSim+扩展处理多数据集设置，包含边际奖励来改进探索。

Result: 在MuJoCo实验中，OffSim相比现有离线IRL方法取得了显著性能提升，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OffSim框架能够直接从专家轨迹中学习环境动态和奖励函数，实现离线策略训练，为强化学习提供了一种更高效的方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

*Shijia Kang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了SESA（SEquential SAmpling）框架，通过顺序采样生成多样化的解决方案草图来缓解强化学习中探索不足和熵崩溃的问题，显著提升了语言模型的推理多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习在增强大语言模型推理能力时存在探索有限和熵崩溃问题，模型倾向于利用狭窄的解决方案集，导致采样多样性丧失，阻碍性能进一步提升。并行采样方法会加剧这一问题，使模型收敛到相似解。

Method: SESA框架采用顺序采样方法，首先生成多样化的解决方案草图，然后将这些草图扩展为完整的推理路径。通过将每个新输出条件设定为基于先前输出，确保整个过程的多样性，防止策略崩溃。

Result: 在合成任务中，顺序采样在路径多样性和从崩溃中恢复方面始终优于传统RL方法。在三个智能体基准测试中，SESA将成功率分别提升了+0.25、+0.42和+0.07绝对点（相对基线RL最高提升211%）。

Conclusion: SESA为探索提供了一种结构化方法，为RL训练的大语言模型实现更有效和多样化的推理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

TL;DR: 提出KME-CLIP方法，通过再生核希尔伯特空间中的内积来改进CLIP中的相似度计算机制，更好地逼近点互信息(PMI)的线性结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP及其变体未能充分利用点互信息(PMI)的线性结构，而理论研究显示跨模态相似度度量应与PMI对应

Method: 在再生核希尔伯特空间中使用内积来近似PMI，理论上证明可以任意精度逼近PMI

Result: 在多个检索和分类任务中整体优于标准CLIP

Conclusion: KME-CLIP通过利用PMI的线性结构，有效提升了多模态对比预训练的性能

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

TL;DR: 论文证明Transformer语言模型是单射的，即不同的输入会映射到不同的连续表示，这意味着可以从模型的隐藏激活中精确恢复原始输入文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即Transformer组件如非线性激活和归一化会导致信息丢失，证明语言模型实际上是单射的，从而支持从表示中精确恢复输入。

Method: 首先数学证明Transformer语言模型在初始化和训练过程中保持单射性；其次通过数十亿次碰撞测试在六个最先进的语言模型上验证；最后提出SipIt算法，可证明且高效地从隐藏激活中重建原始输入。

Result: 理论证明和实证测试均表明Transformer语言模型是单射的，没有观察到碰撞；SipIt算法在实践中实现了精确的可逆性，具有线性时间保证。

Conclusion: 单射性是语言模型的基本且可利用的特性，对透明度、可解释性和安全部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

TL;DR: 知识蒸馏在低数据量场景下效果更显著，这一新发现被称为蒸馏的数据效率。研究通过大量实验验证了数据集大小对蒸馏效果的关键影响，并否定了蒸馏等同于标签平滑的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然知识蒸馏被广泛应用，但其工作原理仍不明确。现有研究主要关注模型大小和泛化能力，本研究从第三个维度——数据集大小出发，探索蒸馏在不同数据量下的表现。

Method: 在多种数据集、任务和神经网络架构上进行广泛的实验，测试现有蒸馏理论在不同数据集大小下的预测能力，分析目标函数、规模和相对样本数等建模因素的影响。

Result: 实验证明蒸馏效果在低数据量场景下不仅保持，而且被放大。研究结果推翻了蒸馏可理解为标签平滑的假设，为暗知识假说提供了进一步证据。

Conclusion: 数据集大小可能是支撑蒸馏机制的一个基本但被忽视的变量，这一新视角揭示了蒸馏的数据效率特性。

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

TL;DR: MC Dropout不确定性在脑肿瘤MRI分割中与分割错误的相关性较弱，特别是在肿瘤边界区域，表明该方法在医学图像分割中定位边界错误的能力有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然MC Dropout被广泛用于估计模型不确定性，但其在识别分割错误（特别是肿瘤边界附近）方面的有效性尚不明确，需要实证研究来评估其实际效果。

Method: 使用U-Net在四种数据增强设置（无增强、水平翻转、旋转、缩放）下进行2D脑肿瘤MRI分割，通过50次随机前向传播计算不确定性，并使用Pearson和Spearman系数将不确定性与像素级错误进行相关性分析。

Result: 结果显示全局相关性较弱（r≈0.30-0.38），边界相关性可忽略（|r|<0.05）。虽然不同增强设置间的差异具有统计显著性（p<0.001），但缺乏实际意义。

Conclusion: MC Dropout不确定性在定位边界错误方面提供的线索有限，强调了在医学图像分割中需要开发替代或混合不确定性估计方法的必要性。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

Result: 实证评估显示SDR优于基线方法，在不同战略强度下实现7.6%-29.3%的偏差减少，并在代理群体规模变化时保持稳健可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架为代理对干预做出战略响应时的可靠因果推断提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Strategic Doubly Robust (SDR) estimator, a novel framework
that integrates strategic equilibrium modeling with doubly robust estimation
for causal inference in strategic environments. SDR addresses endogenous
treatment assignment arising from strategic agent behavior, maintaining double
robustness while incorporating strategic considerations. Theoretical analysis
confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic
unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance
over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying
strategic strengths and maintaining robust scalability with agent populations.
The framework provides a principled approach for reliable causal inference when
agents respond strategically to interventions.

TL;DR: 本文证明了神经特征假设(NFA)在多层线性网络中的深度依赖性，发现NFA指数α=1/L，并揭示了权重衰减对不平衡初始化的重要性，同时指出非线性激活函数可能破坏NFA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解特征学习是建立深度神经网络数学基础的重要开放问题。神经特征假设(NFA)指出训练后第一层权重的Gram矩阵与输入梯度外积平均值的α次方成正比，需要验证其在多层网络中的有效性。

Method: 使用梯度流动力学和平衡权重初始化，分析多层线性网络的训练过程，并考虑不平衡初始化和权重衰减的影响，同时通过数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 证明对于L≥2层线性网络，NFA在整个训练过程中成立且指数α=1/L，显示深度依赖性；对于不平衡初始化，应用权重衰减时NFA渐近成立；但某些非线性激活网络即使完美拟合训练数据也不满足NFA。

Conclusion: NFA在多层线性网络中具有深度依赖性，权重衰减对不平衡初始化的NFA成立至关重要，而非线性激活可能破坏NFA，这为理解深度网络特征学习提供了重要理论洞见。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

Method: 使用树分解将CNF公式编码为连接图，在连接图上执行迭代消息传递，通过学习分区函数来近似模型数量，并应用注意力机制关注关键变量和簇。

Result: 实验表明Attn-JGNN模型比其他神经网络方法取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 注意力增强的Join-Graph神经网络模型能够有效提升#SAT问题的求解精度，注意力机制有助于关注关键变量并减少冗余计算。

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRATING是一种无需训练的推理系统，通过渐进式聚类剪枝和内存优化策略，显著降低语义Top-K选择任务的延迟和内存使用，在保持精度的同时提升边缘设备上的部署效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义Top-K选择在边缘AI服务中至关重要，但其延迟和内存需求在边缘硬件上占主导地位。研究发现相对排名比精确分数更重要，且中间层存在序列级稀疏性，为剪枝提供了机会。

Method: 提出整体前向传播方法，通过维护全局候选视图进行渐进式聚类剪枝，采用双层滑动窗口和分块执行策略重叠I/O与计算，从而限制峰值内存使用。

Result: 在0.6B到8B参数的reranker上评估，GRATING在微基准测试中延迟降低达89.0%，峰值内存降低达94.9%，且精度无损失。在三个真实世界应用中，延迟降低11.6%-51.0%，峰值内存降低18.6%-77.8%。

Conclusion: GRATING通过利用相对排名的重要性和序列级稀疏性，显著提升了边缘设备上语义Top-K选择的效率和可部署性，为检索增强生成、智能体记忆和个性化推荐等应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

Result: 在必要性和充分性解释的自动评估中，该方法对大多数查询类型都显示出有效性，优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP能够有效解释神经预测器从不完整知识图谱中推断新知识的价值，相比仅依赖现有事实的符号方法具有优势。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

Conclusion: 该框架具有适应不同编码器/解码器的灵活性，能够跨相关PDE族泛化，是科学机器学习中可扩展的物理编码工具。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于位运算的Tsetlin Machine高效软件实现，通过指令级位操作、提前退出机制和文字重排序策略，在ARM处理器上实现推理时间减少96.71%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tsetlin Machine在资源受限设备上具有高速推理能力，其逻辑驱动操作适合在现代CPU架构上并行执行，因此需要优化实现以充分利用硬件特性

Method: 1) 使用指令级位运算进行紧凑模型表示和加速处理；2) 引入基于AND子句评估的提前退出机制；3) 提出文字重排序策略最大化提前退出概率；4) 在训练后推理前阶段通过统计分析实现重排序

Result: 在ARM处理器上的gem5模拟器实验显示，优化实现相比传统整数型TM实现减少推理时间达96.71%，同时保持相当的代码密度

Conclusion: 所提出的位运算实现、提前退出机制和文字重排序策略能显著提升Tsetlin Machine的推理效率，特别适合资源受限设备部署

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乘法自由模型如DLGNs训练成本高，且难以扩展到多输入逻辑块，需要更高效的梯度学习方法。

Method: 使用Walsh变换辅助的概率查找表(WARP-LUTs)，减少可训练参数数量，实现更快的梯度学习。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上比DLGNs收敛显著更快，同时保持可比精度，参数数量大幅减少。

Conclusion: WARP-LUTs为高效逻辑门组合学习提供了可行方案，有望扩展到多输入逻辑块，适合FPGA实时科学应用。

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CarBoN是一个测试时校准框架，通过自适应调整模型参数（温度T和偏移向量δ）来引导生成更可靠的推理路径，相比传统Best-of-N采样方法，在相同精度下可减少4倍采样次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试时扩展方法如Best-of-N采样在N增加时收益递减，存在效率低下的问题。需要一种无需重新训练大语言模型就能提高推理任务性能的方法。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：先探索解空间，然后学习输入特定的温度T和加性偏移向量δ来校准logits，引导生成朝向高奖励推理路径。该框架也适用于束搜索等步骤级采样策略。

Result: 在MATH-500和AIME-2024上的实验显示，CarBoN在达到相同精度时最多可减少4倍采样次数，在固定预算下通常能获得更高准确率。

Conclusion: CarBoN通过测试时校准有效提高了推理任务的效率和性能，温度T和偏移向量δ在平衡输出多样性和正确性方面发挥互补作用，该框架具有通用性。

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

TL;DR: 使用机器学习方法基于电磁参数对IPMSM转子形状（2D型、V型、Nabla型）进行分类，作为传统有限元分析的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法分析转子形状计算成本高，需要开发更快速、成本更低的替代方法。

Method: 比较评估了自定义深度学习模型KS-Net与多种经典算法（Cubic SVM、Quadratic SVM、Fine KNN等），使用包含9,000个样本的平衡数据集，采用10折交叉验证。

Result: Cubic SVM和Quadratic SVM算法实现100%准确率，KS-Net模型达到99.98%准确率（仅2个误分类），与传统方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可以高精度预测IPMSM转子形状，为加速电机设计过程、开发自动化转子识别系统和数据驱动故障诊断提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用对抗扰动方法忽略了领域特定的特征关系约束，导致生成的对抗样本不切实际或易于检测，限制了实际应用

Method: 使用增强拉格朗日最小最大优化公式，采用基于梯度的交替优化策略来强制执行多个复杂约束

Result: 在金融、IT网络和网络物理系统等多个领域评估，CAP实现了更高的攻击成功率，同时显著减少了运行时间

Conclusion: CAP方法能够有效处理约束特征空间中的对抗攻击，并提出了从数据中学习特征约束的原则性方法，适用于结构化输入空间的各种领域

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProofOptimizer是一个通过强化学习训练的语言模型，专门用于简化Lean证明，无需人工监督，能显著压缩证明长度并提高验证效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经定理证明生成的证明虽然能被Lean等系统验证，但过于冗长难以理解，限制了数学洞察力。现有方法难以处理RL训练证明器生成的极长证明，且缺乏训练数据。

Method: 通过专家迭代和强化学习训练ProofOptimizer模型，使用Lean验证简化并提供训练信号；推理时采用迭代证明缩短工作流程逐步减少证明长度。

Result: 在标准基准测试中显著压缩证明长度：miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，Seed-Prover的IMO 2025证明减少49%。简化后的证明在Lean中验证更快，作为训练数据还能提升下游证明器性能。

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer是首个无需人工监督就能简化Lean证明的语言模型，有效解决了证明简化的关键瓶颈，为数学定理证明提供了更简洁高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

TL;DR: 提出ProSh算法，通过风险预算增强状态空间，使用学习到的成本评论家对策略分布施加屏蔽，确保所有采样动作在期望上保持安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习系统的安全性是主要关注点，需要开发既能最优执行又能提供正式安全保证的系统。

Method: ProSh是一种无模型的安全强化学习算法，在约束MDP状态空间中添加风险预算，使用学习到的成本评论家对策略分布施加屏蔽。

Result: 在确定性环境中保持最优性，提供仅依赖于备份评论家精度的成本期望紧上界，实验显示在训练期间也能保证安全性。

Conclusion: ProSh算法能够在训练期间提供形式化的安全保证，同时保持最优性能。

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自动机反馈的强化学习方法，用DFA生成的轨迹偏好替代显式奖励函数，无需手动设计奖励，在具有时间依赖性的任务中优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习方法在处理具有复杂历史依赖奖励结构的环境时面临挑战，需要大量手动奖励工程。

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机(DFA)生成轨迹偏好来学习奖励函数，包含静态方法(直接使用学习到的奖励函数进行策略优化)和动态方法(通过迭代更新持续优化奖励函数和策略)。

Result: 在离散和连续环境中的实验表明，该方法在具有时间依赖性的任务中学习到有效策略，优于传统奖励工程和基于自动机的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于自动机的偏好方法在处理非马尔可夫奖励方面具有优势，为传统奖励建模提供了可扩展、高效且无需人工干预的替代方案，并提供了收敛性保证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

Motivation: 有限元分析计算成本高，不适合设计优化问题，深度学习模型可作为解决方案，但需要选择能准确模拟FEA的架构。

Method: 采用图神经网络和3D U-Net作为FEA替代模型，引入基于Navier-Cauchy方程的物理信息神经网络框架，使用课程学习策略（数据预训练后物理信息微调）。

Result: GNN显著优于U-Net，最差GCN框架相对L2误差8.7%，最佳U-Net为13.0%。MPNN和Graph Transformer精度最高，相对L2误差分别为3.5%和2.6%。PINN显著改善泛化能力，误差降低达11.3%。

Conclusion: Graph Transformer精度最高但推理速度慢37.5%，PINN增强的MPNN提供了预测性能、模型大小和推理速度之间的最佳平衡，是最实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要关注减轻遗忘和提高准确率，但忽视了网络校准这一重要方面。神经崩溃现象在持续学习中显示出优势，但很少有工作专门改进持续学习模型的校准性

Method: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)，一种针对神经崩溃方法设计的自适应混合策略。该方法根据神经崩溃下特征空间的几何特性调整混合过程，确保更鲁棒的正则化和对齐

Result: 实验表明SAMix显著提升性能，在持续学习中超越最先进方法，同时改进模型校准。提高了跨任务准确率和预测的可靠性

Conclusion: SAMix是持续学习系统的重要进展，不仅提升准确率，还增强了预测的可靠性，为构建更鲁棒的持续学习系统提供了有前景的方法

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust
continual learning systems.

Motivation: 现有的预训练时间序列模型主要关注单变量预测，限制了其在包含多变量数据和协变量的真实场景中的应用。

Method: 采用组注意力机制，通过在合成数据集上训练，将多样化的多变量结构施加于单变量序列，实现跨序列的高效信息共享和上下文学习。

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

Conclusion: 该混合方法在优化代理和经典求解器之间实现了良好的平衡，提供了可解释的速度-最优性权衡，能够基于用户定义的最优性阈值实现可信赖的部署。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

Abstract: Contract theory studies how a principal can incentivize agents to exert
costly, unobservable effort through performance-based payments. While classical
economic models provide elegant characterizations of optimal solutions, modern
applications, ranging from online labor markets and healthcare to AI delegation
and blockchain protocols, call for an algorithmic perspective. The challenge is
no longer only which contracts induce desired behavior, but whether such
contracts can be computed efficiently. This viewpoint has given rise to
\emph{algorithmic contract design}, paralleling the rise of algorithmic
mechanism design two decades ago.
  This article focuses on \emph{combinatorial contracts}, an emerging frontier
within algorithmic contract design, where agents may choose among exponentially
many combinations of actions, or where multiple agents must work together as a
team, and the challenge lies in selecting the right composition. These models
capture a wide variety of real-world contracting environments, from hospitals
coordinating physicians across treatment protocols to firms hiring teams of
engineers for interdependent tasks. We review three combinatorial settings: (i)
a single agent choosing multiple actions, (ii) multiple agents with binary
actions, and (iii) multiple agents each selecting multiple actions. For each,
we highlight structural insights, algorithmic techniques, and complexity
barriers. Results include tractable cases such as gross substitutes reward
functions, hardness results, and approximation guarantees under value- and
demand-oracle access. By charting these advances, the article maps the emerging
landscape of combinatorial contract design, and highlights fundamental open
questions and promising directions for future work.

Motivation: 解决不完美信息游戏中hand abstraction缺乏正式任务模型和评估方法的问题，特别是德州扑克类游戏中的信号抽象挑战。

Method: 引入SOOGs框架分离信号和玩家动作序列，定义分辨率界限，提出FROI方法整合历史信息来提升抽象质量。

Result: 实验证明FROI在hold'em风格基准测试中持续优于基于结果的不完美回忆基线方法。

Conclusion: 为hand abstraction提供了统一的正式处理框架，并为设计更高分辨率抽象提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Hand abstraction is crucial for scaling imperfect-information games (IIGs)
such as Texas Hold'em, yet progress is limited by the lack of a formal task
model and by evaluations that require resource-intensive strategy solving. We
introduce signal observation ordered games (SOOGs), a subclass of IIGs tailored
to hold'em-style games that cleanly separates signal from player action
sequences, providing a precise mathematical foundation for hand abstraction.
Within this framework, we define a resolution bound-an information-theoretic
upper bound on achievable performance under a given signal abstraction. Using
the bound, we show that mainstream outcome-based imperfect-recall algorithms
suffer substantial losses by arbitrarily discarding historical information; we
formalize this behavior via potential-aware outcome Isomorphism (PAOI) and
prove that PAOI characterizes their resolution bound. To overcome this
limitation, we propose full-recall outcome isomorphism (FROI), which integrates
historical information to raise the bound and improve policy quality.
Experiments on hold'em-style benchmarks confirm that FROI consistently
outperforms outcome-based imperfect-recall baselines. Our results provide a
unified formal treatment of hand abstraction and practical guidance for
designing higher-resolution abstractions in IIGs.

Abstract: Motivated by the problem of selling large, proprietary data, we consider an
information pricing problem proposed by Bergemann et al. that involves a
decision-making buyer and a monopolistic seller. The seller has access to the
underlying state of the world that determines the utility of the various
actions the buyer may take. Since the buyer gains greater utility through
better decisions resulting from more accurate assessments of the state, the
seller can therefore promise the buyer supplemental information at a price. To
contend with the fact that the seller may not be perfectly informed about the
buyer's private preferences (or utility), we frame the problem of designing a
data product as one where the seller designs a revenue-maximizing menu of
statistical experiments.
  Prior work by Cai et al. showed that an optimal menu can be found in time
polynomial in the state space, whereas we observe that the state space is
naturally exponential in the dimension of the data. We propose an algorithm
which, given only sampling access to the state space, provably generates a
near-optimal menu with a number of samples independent of the state space. We
then analyze a special case of high-dimensional Gaussian data, showing that (a)
it suffices to consider scalar Gaussian experiments, (b) the optimal menu of
such experiments can be found efficiently via a semidefinite program, and (c)
full surplus extraction occurs if and only if a natural separation condition
holds on the set of potential preferences of the buyer.

Abstract: The E-commerce advertising platforms typically sell commercial traffic
through either second-price auction (SPA) or first-price auction (FPA). SPA was
historically prevalent due to its dominant strategy incentive-compatible (DSIC)
for bidders with quasi-linear utilities, especially when budgets are not a
binding constraint, while FPA has gained more prominence for offering higher
revenue potential to publishers and avoiding the possibility for discriminatory
treatment in personalized reserve prices. Meanwhile, on the demand side,
advertisers are increasingly adopting platform-wide marketing solutions akin to
QuanZhanTui, shifting from spending budgets solely on commercial traffic to
bidding on the entire traffic for the purpose of maximizing overall sales. For
automated bidding systems, such a trend poses a critical challenge: determining
optimal strategies across heterogeneous auction channels to fulfill diverse
advertiser objectives, such as maximizing return (MaxReturn) or meeting target
return on ad spend (TargetROAS). To overcome this challenge, this work makes
two key contributions. First, we derive an efficient solution for optimal
bidding under FPA channels, which takes into account the presence of organic
traffic - traffic can be won for free. Second, we introduce a marginal cost
alignment (MCA) strategy that provably secures bidding efficiency across
heterogeneous auction mechanisms. To validate performance of our developed
framework, we conduct comprehensive offline experiments on public datasets and
large-scale online A/B testing, which demonstrate consistent improvements over
existing methods.

Conclusion: RC-TIM机制通过支持合同重新协商，使联邦学习系统能够更好地适应运行环境中的不可预测变化，提高激励效果和系统适应性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has gained prominence due to heightened concerns over
data privacy. Privacy restrictions limit the visibility for data consumers
(DCs) to accurately assess the capabilities and efforts of data owners (DOs).
Thus, for open collaborative FL markets to thrive, effective incentive
mechanisms are key as they can motivate data owners (DOs) to contribute to FL
tasks. Contract theory is a useful technique for developing FL incentive
mechanisms. Existing approaches generally assume that once the contract between
a DC and a DO is signed, it remains unchanged until the FL task is finished.
However, unforeseen circumstances might force a DO to be unable to fulfill the
current contract, resulting in inefficient utilization of DCs' budgets. To
address this limitation, we propose the Renegotiable Contract-Theoretic
Incentive Mechanism (RC-TIM) for FL. Unlike previous approaches, it adapts to
changes in DOs' behavior and budget constraints by supporting the renegotiation
of contracts, providing flexible and dynamic incentives. Under RC-TIM, an FL
system is more adaptive to unpredictable changes in the operating environment
that can affect the quality of the service provided by DOs. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that RC-TIM significantly
outperforms four state-of-the-art related methods, delivering up to a 45.76%
increase in utility on average.

Conclusion: 动态共同投资方案能有效解决移动边缘计算基础设施投资中的风险分担和灵活性需求问题，通过联盟博弈理论实现参与者的利益平衡。

Abstract: Technologies such as Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) depend on the availability
of infrastructure. We define the Infrastructure Provider (InP) as the actor
responsible for deploying and maintaining this infrastructure, while Service
Providers (SPs) operate applications over it to serve end users and earn
revenues. Deploying such infrastructure requires however a significant
investment, and the InP may be reluctant to bear it alone. We propose
co-investment to overcome this barrier, allowing players, the InP and multiple
SPs, to share costs and revenues. However, committing to a co-investment over a
long period may be too constraining for players: in an unforeseeable future,
players may realize that they could make more profit outside the co-investment
(such a profit is called opportunity cost). For this reason, we propose a
scheme, based on coalitional game theory, which is dynamic in terms of
(i)allowing players to join, remain in, or leave the co-investment, (ii)
adjusting the infrastructure capacity and resource sharing over time. We
propose a method to compute entry fees and exit penalties in order to
appropriately compensate players remaining in the co-investment. We numerically
show that our dynamic scheme encourages player participation and increases
profit (in case of high opportunity cost).

Motivation: Axelrod在1980年代组织的两次IPD计算机锦标赛具有历史影响力，但档案记录不完整，缺乏可重现性。本文旨在填补这一空白，重现第二次锦标赛的结果。

Method: 通过恢复幸存的Fortran实现使其与现代编译器兼容，并构建Python接口调用原始策略函数，使用Axelrod-Python库运行锦标赛。

Result: 成功重现了Axelrod的主要发现：TFT获胜，成功策略具有合作性、对背叛的响应性和宽恕性。在更广泛的策略环境中，原始锦标赛对TFT特别有利。

Conclusion: 这是对Axelrod第二次锦标赛的首次系统性重现，为未来研究提供了易于使用的实现，并重新评估了原始结果在新策略和环境下的表现。

Abstract: Direct reciprocity, typically studied using the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
(IPD), is central to understanding how cooperation evolves. In the 1980s,
Robert Axelrod organized two influential IPD computer tournaments, where Tit
for Tat (TFT) emerged as the winner. Yet the archival record is incomplete: for
the first tournament only a report survives, and for the second the submitted
Fortran strategies remain but not the final tournament code. This gap raises
questions about the reproducibility of these historically influential results.
We recreate the second tournament by restoring the surviving Fortran
implementations to compile with modern compilers and by building a Python
interface that calls the original strategy functions without modification.
Using the open-source Axelrod-Python library to run tournaments, we reproduce
Axelrod's main findings: TFT prevails, and successful play tends to be
cooperative, responsive to defection, and willing to forgive. Strategy rankings
remain mostly unchanged. We then assess the robustness of the originally
submitted strategies by incorporating additional strategies, and we run one of
the largest IPD tournaments to date. We find that the original tournament was
especially favorable to TFT and that it is difficult to dethrone TFT when the
original submissions make up the majority of the field. We also observe that
several lesser-known submissions perform strongly in more diverse settings and
under noise. Our contributions are: (i) the first systematic reproduction of
Axelrod's second tournament; (ii) a contemporary reassessment of the original
results in light of new strategies and settings; and (iii) a preserved,
easy-to-use implementation of the second-tournament strategies within
Axelrod-Python to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逆博弈理论方法没有将学习者视为游戏的主动参与者，这限制了学习过程的效果。本文旨在扩展逆博弈理论，让领导者能够主动选择行动来增强对跟随者成本函数的理解。

Method: 针对具有有限理性的Stackelberg博弈，开发了两种方法：1）利用Fisher信息最大化关于未知参数的信息增益的主动学习方法；2）在考虑领导者自身成本时，平衡探索与利用的主动逆博弈方法。

Result: 证明了主动学习方法的参数一致性和渐近正态性，以及主动逆博弈方法在二次成本函数下的渐近Stackelberg均衡。仿真验证了这些方法的特性，表明主动逆博弈方法能通过主动探索更快达到Stackelberg均衡。

Conclusion: 主动逆博弈方法能够显著提升学习效率，通过主动探索更快地达到博弈均衡，为逆博弈理论提供了新的研究方向和应用价值。

Abstract: Inverse game theory is utilized to infer the cost functions of all players
based on game outcomes. However, existing inverse game theory methods do not
consider the learner as an active participant in the game, which could
significantly enhance the learning process. In this paper, we extend inverse
game theory to active inverse methods. For Stackelberg games with bounded
rationality, the leader, acting as a learner, actively chooses actions to
better understand the follower's cost functions. First, we develop a method of
active learning by leveraging Fisher information to maximize information gain
about the unknown parameters and prove the consistency and asymptotic
normality. Additionally, when leaders consider its cost, we develop a method of
active inverse game to balance exploration and exploitation, and prove the
consistency and asymptotic Stackelberg equilibrium with quadratic cost
functions. Finally, we verify the properties of these methods through
simulations in the quadratic case and demonstrate that the active inverse game
method can achieve Stackelberg equilibrium more quickly through active
exploration.

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex problems due to
their ability to provide near-optimal solutions. But the execution time of
these algorithms increases with the problem size and solution space. And, to
get more promising results, we have to execute these algorithms for a large
number of iterations, requiring a large amount of time and this is one of the
main issues found with these algorithms. To handle the same, researchers are
now-adays working on design and development of parallel versions of state of
the art metaheuristic optimization algorithms. We, in this paper, present a
parallel implementation of state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer using
NVIDIA CUDA framework to leverage GPU acceleration. Our implementation
optimizes the state of the art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer (APO) to achieve
high performance. We implement both the existing sequential version and the
proposed parallel version of Artificial Protozoa Optimizer in this paper. The

*Ivan Kartashov,Mariia Pushkareva,Iakov Karandashev*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: SpikeFit是一种新的SNN训练方法，通过联合优化离散权重值和模型参数，实现高效的神经形态硬件部署，支持低精度（2/4/8位）和有限连接数约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统压缩方法只能处理部分神经形态硬件约束的问题，如有限数值精度和神经元数量限制，实现更全面的硬件部署。

Method: 将允许的权重离散值作为可学习参数与模型共同优化，采用聚类感知训练（CAT）和硬件友好的Fisher Spike Contribution（FSC）剪枝方法。

Result: 在仅使用4个唯一突触权重值（M=4）的约束下，SpikeFit超越了现有SNN压缩方法和传统基线，满足更广泛的硬件要求并提供最低能耗。

Conclusion: SpikeFit通过联合优化离散权重集和硬件约束，实现了在神经形态处理器上最完整的部署，比现有SNN压缩方法支持更广泛的硬件范围。

Abstract: This paper introduces SpikeFit, a novel training method for Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) that enables efficient inference on neuromorphic hardware,
considering all its stringent requirements: the number of neurons and synapses
that can fit on a single device, and lower bit-width representations (e.g.,
4-bit, 8-bit). Unlike conventional compressing approaches that address only a
subset of these requirements (limited numerical precision and limited number of
neurons in the network), SpikeFit treats the allowed weights' discrete values
themselves as learnable parameters co-optimized with the model, allowing for
optimal Clusterization-Aware Training (CAT) of the model's weights at low
precision (2-, 4-, or 8-bit) which results in higher network compression
efficiency, as well as limiting the number of unique synaptic connections to a
value required by neuromorphic processor. This joint optimization allows
SpikeFit to find a discrete weight set aligned with hardware constraints,
enabling the most complete deployment across a broader range of neuromorphic
processors than existing methods of SNN compression support. Moreover, SpikeFit
introduces a new hardware-friendly Fisher Spike Contribution (FSC) pruning
method showing the state-of-the-art performance. We demonstrate that for
spiking neural networks constrained to only four unique synaptic weight values
(M = 4), our SpikeFit method not only outperforms state-of-the-art SNNs
compression methods and conventional baselines combining extreme quantization
schemes and clustering algorithms, but also meets a wider range of neuromorphic
hardware requirements and provides the lowest energy use in experiments.

Abstract: The rapid decentralization and digitalization of local electricity markets
have introduced new cyber-physical vulnerabilities, including key leakage, data
tampering, and identity spoofing. Existing blockchain-based solutions provide
transparency and traceability but still depend on classical cryptographic
primitives that are vulnerable to quantum attacks. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes Q-EnergyDEX, a zero-trust distributed energy trading
framework driven by quantum key distribution and blockchain. The framework
integrates physical-layer quantum randomness with market-level operations,
providing an end-to-end quantum-secured infrastructure. A cloud-based Quantum
Key Management Service continuously generates verifiable entropy and regulates
key generation through a rate-adaptive algorithm to sustain high-quality
randomness. A symmetric authentication protocol (Q-SAH) establishes secure and
low-latency sessions, while the quantum-aided consensus mechanism (PoR-Lite)
achieves probabilistic ledger finality within a few seconds. Furthermore, a
Stackelberg-constrained bilateral auction couples market clearing with entropy
availability, ensuring both economic efficiency and cryptographic security.
Simulation results show that Q-EnergyDEX maintains robust key stability and
near-optimal social welfare, demonstrating its feasibility for large-scale
decentralized energy markets.

between the two domains and includes a causal scene editor that enables
controllable scenario creation and counterfactual analysis under diverse
conditions such as different weather, emergency events, and dynamic obstacles.
We release TranSimHub as an open-source platform that supports end-to-end
research on perception, fusion, and control across realistic air and ground
traffic scenes. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多旋翼飞行器需要过度驱动（超过6个输入）才能实现全向运动，这会增加复杂性和内部力。本文旨在设计一种仅用6个输入就能实现全向运动且平衡时无内力的飞行器。

Method: 集成一个主动倾斜螺旋桨和3个带螺旋桨的摆式连杆，通过被动万向节连接到主体。开发详细动力学模型，识别平衡配置，使用动态反馈线性化和反步法设计几何非线性控制器。

Conclusion: 该设计成功实现了仅用6个输入的全向多旋翼飞行器，平衡时无内力，控制器在各种条件下都能稳定运行，为全向飞行器设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel concept for achieving omnidirectionality in a
multirotor aerial vehicle (MAV) that uses only 6 inputs and ensures no internal
forces at the equilibria. The concept integrates a single actively-tilting
propeller along with 3 pendulum-like links, each carrying a propeller,
connected by passive universal joints to the main body. We show that this
design ensures omnidirectionality while minimizing the internal forces and
without resorting to overactuation (i.e., more than 6 inputs). A detailed
dynamic model of the multi-link MAV is first developed. Afterwards, the
analysis identifies the equilibrium configurations and illustrates that a
forced equilibrium exists for every pose of the MAV's main platform. In order
to render this equilibrium asymptotically stable for the closed-loop system, a
geometric nonlinear controller is constructed using dynamic feedback
linearization and backstepping techniques with the main platform configuration
error being the left-trivialized error on SE(3). The stability of the
closed-loop system is then investigated by employing standard Lyapunov
arguments on the zero dynamics. We conclude by providing numerical simulations
validating the proposed approach. They demonstrate the MAV capability to
perform decoupled attitude and translational motions under non-zero initial
conditions, parametric uncertainty, and actuators noise.

Abstract: With the practical implementation of connected and autonomous vehicles
(CAVs), the traffic system is expected to remain a mix of CAVs and human-driven
vehicles (HVs) for the foreseeable future. To enhance safety and traffic
efficiency, the trajectory planning strategies of CAVs must account for the
influence of HVs, necessitating accurate HV trajectory prediction. Current
research often assumes that human drivers have perfect knowledge of all
vehicles' objectives, an unrealistic premise. This paper bridges the gap by
leveraging hypergame theory to account for cognitive and perception limitations
in HVs. We model human bounded rationality without assuming them to be merely
passive followers and propose a hierarchical cognition modeling framework that
captures cognitive relationships among vehicles. We further analyze the
cognitive stability of the system, proving that the strategy profile where all
vehicles adopt cognitively equilibrium strategies constitutes a hyper Nash
equilibrium when CAVs accurately learn HV parameters. To achieve this, we
develop an inverse learning algorithm for distributed intention interpretation
via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, which extends the framework to
both offline and online scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a distributed
trajectory prediction and planning approach for CAVs, leveraging the learned
parameters in real time. Simulations in highway lane-changing scenarios
demonstrate the proposed method's accuracy in parameter learning, robustness to
noisy trajectory observations, and safety in HV trajectory prediction. The
results validate the effectiveness of our method in both offline and online
implementations.

TL;DR: 该论文开发了鲁棒的暂态学习方法，通过稀疏优化和方法矩法相结合，使高斯过程学习能够抵抗数据流中的稀疏分布性数据损坏，并优化稀疏权重来识别损坏的仪表位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际测量数据可能被各种随机和针对性威胁所破坏，导致学习结果不准确和无意义，因此需要开发能够克服这一挑战的鲁棒学习方法。

Method: 将稀疏优化与方法矩法相结合，使学习对数据损坏的稀疏分布具有鲁棒性；优化稀疏权重以识别损坏的仪表位置；采用K-medoid聚类进行维度缩减和聚合表示启发式方法以提高大规模系统的推理速度。

Conclusion: 所提出的鲁棒暂态学习方法能够有效处理数据损坏问题，同时通过维度缩减和聚合表示技术显著提高了大规模系统的推理效率。

Abstract: Advances in leveraging Gaussian processes (GP) have enabled learning and
inferring dynamic grid behavior from scarce PMU measurements. However, real
measurements can be corrupted by various random and targeted threats, leading
to inaccurate and meaningless results. This paper develops robust transient
learning to overcome this challenge by exploiting the sparse corruption
patterns in the data flow. Specifically, we integrate sparse optimization with
method of moments (MoM) to make learning robust to a sparse distribution of
data corruptions; then, we optimize sparse weights to identify corrupted meter
locations. To improve inference speed on large-scale systems, we further adopt
K-medoid clustering of locations to develop dimension reduction (DR) and
aggregate representation (AR) heuristics. Experimental results demonstrate
robustness against random large errors, targeted false data injections, and
local PMU clock drifts. On a 1354-bus system, inference turns out to be 18x
faster using DR and 400x faster when further combined with AR heuristics.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了Tail-Optimized LRU方法，通过简单的两行修改优化LLM推理中的尾部延迟，相比传统LRU策略在真实对话数据上显著降低尾部延迟和SLO违规率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LRU缓存策略在优化尾部延迟方面表现不佳，因为它忽视了对话长度的异质性。在LLM推理中，尾部延迟对实际应用至关重要，但缺乏专门优化的缓存策略。

Method: 提出Tail-Optimized LRU，通过重新分配KV缓存容量，优先保留高延迟对话的缓存条目，驱逐不太可能影响未来轮次的缓存项。

Result: 在WildChat真实对话数据上，相比LRU策略，P90尾部TTFT延迟降低27.5%，P95尾部延迟降低23.9%，200ms SLO违规率降低38.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法为实际LLM部署中的尾部延迟优化提供了实用且理论依据充分的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt caching is critical for reducing latency and cost in LLM inference:
OpenAI and Anthropic report up to 50-90% cost savings through prompt reuse.
Despite its widespread success, little is known about what constitutes an
optimal prompt caching policy, particularly when optimizing tail latency, a
metric of central importance to practitioners. The widely used Least Recently
Used (LRU) policy can perform arbitrarily poor on this metric, as it is
oblivious to the heterogeneity of conversation lengths. To address this gap, we
propose Tail-Optimized LRU, a simple two-line modification that reallocates KV
cache capacity to prioritize high-latency conversations by evicting cache
entries that are unlikely to affect future turns. Though the implementation is
simple, we prove its optimality under a natural stochastic model of
conversation dynamics, providing the first theoretical justification for LRU in
this setting, a result that may be of independent interest to the caching
community. Experimentally, on real conversation data WildChat, Tail-Optimized
LRU achieves up to 27.5% reduction in P90 tail Time to First Token latency and
23.9% in P95 tail latency compared to LRU, along with up to 38.9% decrease in
SLO violations of 200ms. We believe this provides a practical and theoretically
grounded option for practitioners seeking to optimize tail latency in
real-world LLM deployments.

Abstract: As connected and autonomous vehicles become more widespread, platooning has
emerged as a key strategy to improve road capacity, reduce fuel consumption,
and enhance traffic flow. However, the benefits of platoons strongly depend on
their ability to maintain stability. Instability can lead to unsafe spacing and
increased energy usage. In this work, we study platoon instability and analyze
the root cause of its occurrence, as well as its impacts on the following
vehicle. To achieve this, we propose a comparative study between different
car-following models such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), the Optimal
Velocity Model (OVM), the General Motors Model (GMM), and the Cooperative
Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC). In our approach, we introduce a disruption in
the model by varying the velocity of the leading vehicle to visualize the
behavior of the following vehicles. To evaluate the dynamic response of each
model, we introduce controlled perturbations in the velocity of the leading
vehicle, specifically, sinusoidal oscillations and discrete velocity changes.
The resulting vehicle trajectories and variations in inter-vehicle spacing are
analyzed to assess the robustness of each model to disturbance propagation. The
findings offer insight into model sensitivity, stability characteristics, and
implications for designing resilient platooning control strategies.

Motivation: 分布式能源资源和需求侧灵活性使VPP成为现代电网运营核心，但其端到端业务管道面临复杂网络攻击和极端天气的双重压力，传统密码学保护有限，量子密钥分配虽具信息论安全性但密钥生成率有限，需要优化分配稀缺量子密钥。

Abstract: The proliferation of distributed energy resources (DERs) and demand-side
flexibility has made virtual power plants (VPPs) central to modern grid
operation. Yet their end-to-end business pipeline, covering bidding, dispatch,
metering, settlement, and archival, forms a tightly coupled
cyber-physical-economic system where secure and timely communication is
critical. Under the combined stress of sophisticated cyberattacks and extreme
weather shocks, conventional cryptography offers limited long-term protection.
Quantum key distribution (QKD), with information-theoretic guarantees, is
viewed as a gold standard for securing critical infrastructures. However,
limited key generation rates, routing capacity, and system overhead render key
allocation a pressing challenge: scarce quantum keys must be scheduled across
heterogeneous processes to minimize residual risk while maintaining latency
guarantees. This paper introduces a quantum-authenticated aggregation and
settlement framework for VPPs. We first develop a system-threat model that
connects QKD key generation and routing with business-layer security
strategies, authentication strength, refresh frequency, and delay constraints.
Building on this, we formulate a key-budgeted risk minimization problem that
jointly accounts for economic risk, service-level violations, and key-budget
feasibility, and reveal a threshold property linking marginal security value to
shadow prices. Case studies on a representative VPP system demonstrate that the
proposed approach significantly reduces residual risk and SLA violations,
enhances key efficiency and robustness, and aligns observed dynamics with the
theoretical shadow price mechanism.

Abstract: The accelerating digitalization and decentralization of modern power systems
expose critical communication infrastructures to escalating cyber risks,
particularly under emerging quantum computing threats. This paper presents an
integrated techno-economic framework to evaluate the feasibility of Quantum Key
Distribution (QKD) for secure power-system communications. A stochastic system
model is developed to jointly capture time-varying key demand, QKD supply under
optical-loss constraints, station-side buffering, and post-quantum cryptography
(PQC) fallback mechanisms. Analytical conditions are derived for service-level
assurance, including buffer stability, outage probability, and availability
bounds. Building on this, two quantitative metrics, including the Levelized
Cost of Security (LCoSec) and Cost of Incremental Security (CIS), are
formulated to unify capital, operational, and risk-related expenditures within
a discounted net-present-value framework. Using IEEE 118-bus, 123-node, and
39-bus test systems, we conduct discrete-event simulations comparing PQC-only,
QKD-only, and Hybrid architectures across multiple topologies and service
profiles. Results show that Hybrid architectures dominated by QKD significantly
reduce key-outage probability and SLA shortfalls, achieving near-unit
availability for real-time and confidentiality-critical services. Economic
analyses reveal clear breakeven zones where QKD-enhanced deployments become
cost-effective, primarily in metropolitan and distribution-level networks under
moderate optical loss and buffer sizing. The proposed framework provides a
reproducible, risk-aware decision tool for guiding large-scale, economically
justified QKD adoption in future resilient power-system infrastructures.

Abstract: In this paper, a predictive constraint-aware control scheme is formulated
within the Command Governor (CG) framework for localized hydration management
of a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell system. First, a comprehensive
nonlinear dynamic model of the fuel cell system is presented which includes a
pseudo 2-dimensional (P2D) model of the stack, reactant supply and cooling
subsystems. The model captures the couplings among the various subsystems and
serves as the basis for designing output feedback controllers to track the
optimal set-points of the air supply and cooling systems for power
optimization. The closed-loop nonlinear model is then used to analyze the
dynamic behavior of membrane hydration near the anode inlet, the driest region
of the membrane in a counter-flow configuration, under various operating
conditions. A reduced-order linearized model is then derived to approximate
hydration behavior with sufficient fidelity for constraint enforcement. This
model is used within the CG framework to adjust the air supply set-points when
necessary to prevent membrane dry-out. The effectiveness of the proposed
approach in maintaining local membrane hydration while closely tracking the
requested net power is demonstrated through realistic drive-cycle simulations.

Abstract: Offshore renewable energy systems offer promising solutions for sustainable
power generation, yet most existing platforms harvest either wind or wave
energy in isolation. This study presents a hybrid floating offshore platform
that integrates a wind turbine with three oscillating surge wave energy
converters (WECs) into a hexagonal semi-submersible structure. In this
configuration, the flaps are integrated with the platform geometry to provide
both energy extraction and hydrodynamic stability. A modeling and simulation
framework was developed using WEC-Sim and benchmarked against the NREL 5 MW
semisubmersible reference. Metacentric height analysis confirmed hydrostatic
stability across a range of prescribed flap angles. Sensitivity analysis of
twelve geometric variables identified flap dimensions and tower length as
dominant drivers of stability, energy capture, and tower stress. Time-domain
simulations revealed dependence on wave incidence angle, with variations in
flap power sharing, capture width ratio (CWR), and platform response. The
feasibility of using flap sweeps to modulate pitch motion was also
demonstrated. Annual energy production (AEP) estimates based on site-specific
data indicate 16.86 GWh from wind and 3.65 GWh from wave energy, with WECs
contributing about 18% of the total. These results highlight the potential of
integrated wind-wave platforms and point toward future studies on structural
modeling and advanced control.

limited by the rigidity of conventional silicon-based chips. We develop two TM
inference models as FlexICs: one achieving 98.5% accuracy using 6800 NAND2
equivalent logic gates with an area of 8X8 mm2, and a second more compact
version achieving slightly lower prediction accuracy of 93% but using only 1420
NAND2 equivalent gates with an area of 4X4 mm2, both of which are
custom-designed for an 8X8-pixel handwritten digit recognition dataset. The
paper demonstrates the feasibility of deploying flexible TM inference engines
into wearable healthcare and edge computing applications.

*Michael Sebek*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文开发了在四元数上的观测器设计方法，避免了特征多项式框架，通过右可观测伴随形式和伴随多项式来编码误差动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的观测器设计方法依赖于特征多项式、行列式和Cayley-Hamilton恒等式，但这些概念在四元数中不适用，因此需要开发新的设计框架。

Method: 使用标准右模约定，推导右可观测伴随形式及其伴随多项式，通过系数更新和相似变换实现设计，避免使用四元数中不适用的传统工具。

Result: 提出了在四元数上直接设计全阶观测器的简单方法，阐明了右谱及其相似类的作用，并确定了经典单步公式仍然有效的情况。

Conclusion: 该方法为四元数系统提供了直接的观测器设计框架，相比向量化或复伴随替代方法具有优势，数值示例验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: We develop observer design over hypercomplex quaternions in a
characteristic-polynomial-free framework. Using the standard right-module
convention, we derive a right observable companion form and its companion
polynomial that encodes error dynamics via right-eigenvalue similarity classes.
The design mirrors the real/complex case - coefficient updates in companion
coordinates, followed by a similarity back - yet avoids determinants,
characteristic/minimal polynomials, and Cayley-Hamilton identities that do not
transfer to quaternions. We also give an Ackermann-type construction for the
important case of closed-loop companion polynomials with real coefficients,
ensuring similarity-equivariant evaluation. The results yield simple recipes
for full-order observers directly over quaternions, clarify the role of right
spectra and their similarity classes, and pinpoint when classical one-shot
formulas remain valid. Numerical examples illustrate the method and advantages
over vectorized or complex-adjoint surrogates.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效管理低压配电系统，实现高效、低成本和隐私保护的运行，同时兼容实时控制需求。

Abstract: This paper presents a predictive control strategy to manage low-voltage
distribution systems. The proposed approach relies on an aggregate of the
flexibility at the residential unit level into a three-dimensional chart that
represents the injected active and reactive power, and the flexibility cost.
First, this method solves a multiparametric optimization problem offline at the
residential unit level to aggregate the flexibility of the assets. Then, a
semi-explicit model predictive control problem is solved to account for
forecasts. By combining the results of these problems with measurements, the
method generates the desired flexibility chart. The proposed approach is
compatible with realtime control requirements, as heavy computations are
performed offline locally, making it naturally parallelizable. By linking
realtime flexibility assessment with energy scheduling, our approach enables
efficient, low-cost, and privacy-preserving management of low-voltage
distribution systems. We validate this method on a low-voltage network of 5
buses by comparing it with an ideal technique.

### [205] [Cross-border offshore hydrogen trade and carbon mitigation for Europe's net zero transition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15695)
*Sheng Wang,Muhammad Maladoh Bah*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文研究了爱尔兰和英国海上绿色氢能在欧洲脱碳中的潜力，开发了自下而上的方法评估氢/氨贸易及其对碳排放减少的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲国家在净零转型和海上能源资源开发方面雄心勃勃，爱尔兰和英国计划的海上风电容量远超其电力需求，出口剩余绿色氢能可能对欧洲碳减排至关重要。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，考虑海上氢生产成本竞争力、国内电力与天然气系统运行以及国际航运成本，评估未来氢/氨贸易。

Result: 海上绿色氢能每年可为欧洲减少175.16 Mt二氧化碳排放，英国在2030-2040年是最大氢供应商，2050年被爱尔兰超越，向法国和西班牙出口161 TWh氢。

Conclusion: 从西到东的氢能流动不仅促进欧洲净零进程，还重塑能源供应结构，确保欧洲大陆的能源安全。

Abstract: European countries are ambitious in both the net-zero transition and offshore
energy resource development. The Irish and UK governments announced their
commitments to offshore wind capacities - 37 and 125 GW, respectively, in 2050,
more than two times higher than their projected power demands. While other
continental countries, such as Germany, are calling for cleaner fuel resources.
Exporting surplus offshore green hydrogen and bridging supply and demand could
be pivotal in carbon emission mitigation for Europe. Yet, the potentials of
these Island countries, are usually underestimated. This paper developed a
bottom-up method to investigate the role of offshore hydrogen from Ireland and
the UK in the decarbonisation of the entire Europe. We evaluate the future
hydrogen/ammonia trading and the contributions of each country in carbon
emission mitigation, considering their relative cost-competitiveness in
offshore hydrogen production, domestic hourly power and gas system operation,
and international shipping costs. Results indicate that the offshore green
hydrogen could reduce 175.16 Mt/year of carbon dioxide emissions in Europe. The
UK will be the largest hydrogen supplier from 2030 to 2040, while surpassed by
Ireland in 2050, with 161 TWh of hydrogen exports to France and Spain. The
offshore green hydrogen can contribute to 175.16 Mt of annual carbon dioxide
emission reductions in total. This general flow of hydrogen from the West to
the East not only facilitates Europe's net-zero progress, but also reshapes the
energy supply structure and helps to ensure energy security across the European
continent.

*Martín de Frutos,Laura Botero-Bolívar,Esteban Ferrer*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出一种桨距控制策略来减少海上风力涡轮机的水下声学足迹，通过调节叶片桨距来降低总体声压级和振幅调制，同时保持较高的能量捕获效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上风力涡轮机产生的水下噪声对依赖声音进行交流、导航和生存的海洋生物造成影响，需要采取措施减少这种声学影响。

Method: 使用耦合叶片元素动量和水-空气声传播模型量化三种参考涡轮机的水下声学特征，提出并实施开环独立桨距控制策略，在叶片通过频率处调节桨距。

Result: 通过约5度的桨距变化，可实现高达5分贝的总体声压级降低和20%的振幅调制深度减少，能量捕获损失仅为5-10%。

Conclusion: 研究发现了一个先前被低估的噪声传播路径，并证明有针对性的叶片桨距调节可以有效减轻其影响。

Abstract: This paper proposes a pitch control strategy to mitigate the underwater
acoustic footprint of offshore wind turbines, a measure that will soon become
necessary to minimize impacts on marine life, which rely on sound for
communication, navigation, and survival. First, we quantify the underwater
acoustic signature of blade-generated aerodynamic noise from three reference
turbines, the NREL 5 MW, DTU 10 MW, and IEA 22 MW, using coupling blade element
momentum and coupled air-water acoustic propagation modeling. Second, we
propose and implement an open-loop individual pitch control (IPC) strategy that
modulates the pitch of the blade at the blade passing frequency to attenuate
the overall sound pressure level (OSPL) and the amplitude modulation (AM) of
the transmitted noise. Third, we benchmark IPC performance against conventional
pitch schemes. The results indicate that up to 5 dB reductions in OSPL and a
decrease in AM depth 20% can be achieved with a pitch variation of
$\Delta\theta\approx 5^\circ$, with small losses (5-10%) in energy capture.
These findings highlight a previously underappreciated noise pathway and
demonstrate that targeted blade-pitch modulation can mitigate its impact.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出基于工业物联网工具的替代PLC的事件驱动自动化架构，通过边缘服务器实现设备抽象、资源互斥、操作组合和工作流编排，在枫糖浆生产中心成功部署验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 替代传统的可编程逻辑控制器中心化自动化方案，寻求更灵活、模块化的工业自动化解决方案，降低物料和集成成本。

Method: 采用分层设计：边缘服务器负责设备抽象、资源互斥、操作组合和工作流编排（使用Node-RED状态机），设备层使用ESP32网关连接传感器和执行器，通过MQTT通信。

Result: 评估显示：消息传输时间约0.1秒，命令发出到运动延迟2-3秒，命令完成约6秒（主要受执行器机械特性影响），运行时间从数十秒到数分钟不等。网络和编排开销相对于过程动态可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了模块化、分布式控制，不牺牲确定性或故障隔离，支持便携容器化部署，并自然支持边缘/云分离架构。

Abstract: This paper presents a practical alternative to
programmable-logic-controller-centric automation by implementing an
event-driven architecture built with industrial Internet of Things tools. A
layered design on a local edge server (i) abstracts actuators, (ii) enforces
mutual exclusion of shared physical resources through an interlock with
priority queueing, (iii) composes deterministic singular operations, and (iv)
orchestrates complete workflows as state machines in Node-RED, with
communication over MQTT. The device layer uses low-cost ESP32-based gateways to
interface sensors and actuators, while all automation logic is offloaded to the
server side. As part of a larger project involving the first
scientifically-documented integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in a maple
syrup boiling center, this work demonstrates the deployment of the proposed
system as a case-study. Evaluation over an entire production season shows
median message time of flight around one tenth of a second, command
issuance-to-motion latencies of about two to three seconds, and command
completion near six seconds dominated by actuator mechanics; operation runtimes
span tens of seconds to minutes. These results indicate that network and
orchestration overheads are negligible relative to process dynamics, enabling
modular, distributed control without compromising determinism or fault
isolation. The approach reduces material and integration effort, supports
portable containerized deployment, and naturally enables an edge/cloud split in
which persistence and analytics are offloaded while automation remains at the
edge.

### [208] [Integrating Conductor Health into Dynamic Line Rating and Unit Commitment under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15740)
*Geon Roh,Jip Kim*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了考虑导线健康状态的机组组合模型(CHA-UC)，通过量化高温运行带来的折旧成本，在动态线路额定值应用中实现更安全经济的运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态线路额定值(DLR)虽然能提高线路利用率，但经常忽视导线高温运行对长期健康的影响，需要量化这种折旧成本并纳入运行决策。

Method: 开发了CHA-UC模型，包含导线温度的鲁棒线性近似，并将小时级高温运行导致的预期折旧成本整合到目标函数中。

Result: 在德州123节点测试系统中，相比静态线路额定值，CHA-UC降低总成本0.8%，减少可再生能源弃电84%；相比不考虑风险的常规DLR，避免了因过度高温运行导致的更高成本。

Conclusion: CHA-UC通过调整机组启停实现更安全的线路潮流，并能自适应管理风电与DLR预测误差之间的相关性，在风险对冲条件下放松潮流，在风险放大条件下收紧潮流。

Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) enables greater utilization of existing
transmission lines by leveraging real-time weather data. However, the elevated
temperature operation (ETO) of conductors under DLR is often overlooked,
despite its long-term impact on conductor health. This paper addresses this
issue by 1) quantifying depreciation costs associated with ETO and 2) proposing
a Conductor Health-Aware Unit Commitment (CHA-UC) that internalizes these costs
in operational decisions. The CHA-UC incorporates a robust linear approximation
of conductor temperature and integration of expected depreciation costs due to
hourly ETO into the objective function. Case studies on the Texas 123-bus
backbone test system using NOAA weather data demonstrate that the proposed
CHA-UC model reduces the total cost by 0.8% and renewable curtailment by
84%compared to static line rating (SLR), while conventional DLR operation
without risk consideration resulted in higher costs due to excessive ETO.
Further analysis of the commitment decisions and the line temperature
statistics confirms that the CHA-UC achieves safer line flows by shifting
generator commitments. Finally, we examine the emergent correlation between
wind generation and DLR forecast errors, and show that CHA-UC adaptively
manages this effect by relaxing flows for risk-hedging conditions while
tightening flows for risk-amplifying ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决车辆在不对称路面上制动时的安全问题，特别是防止车辆过度横向运动（如甩尾）并最小化制动距离，同时考虑输入约束（制动力受路面摩擦力限制）。

Method: 使用备用控制屏障函数进行安全控制设计，提出基于反馈线性化和连续时间Lyapunov方程的系统性方法来构建有效的备用集-备用控制器对。

Result: 通过简单示例验证了所提出的安全关键控制方法，并在四轮车辆模型上实现了不对称路面制动控制，提供了仿真结果。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效保证车辆在不对称路面制动时的安全性，防止过度横向运动，同时优化制动性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a safety-critical control framework to maintain bounded
lateral motions for vehicles braking on asymmetric surfaces. We synthesize a
brake controller that assists drivers and guarantees safety against excessive
lateral motions (i.e., prevents the vehicle from spinning out) while minimizing
the stopping distance. We address this safety-critical control problem in the
presence of input constraints, since braking forces are limited by the
available friction on the road. We use backup control barrier functions for
safe control design. As this approach requires the construction of a backup set
and a backup controller, we propose a novel, systematic method to creating
valid backup set-backup controller pairs based on feedback linearization and
continuous-time Lyapunov equations. We use simple examples to demonstrate our
proposed safety-critical control method. Finally, we implement our approach on
a four-wheel vehicle model for braking on asymmetric surfaces and present
simulation results.

Abstract: Microgrids are emerging as key enablers of resilient, sustainable, and
intelligent power systems, but they continue to face challenges in dynamic
disturbance handling, protection coordination, and uncertainty. Recent efforts
have explored Brain Emotional Learning (BEL) controllers as bio-inspired
solutions for microgrid control. Building on this growing trajectory, this
article introduces a new paradigm for Neuro-Microgrids, inspired by the brain's
sensorimotor gating mechanisms, specifically the Prepulse Inhibition (PPI) and
Prepulse Facilitation (PPF). Sensorimotor gating offers a biological model for
selectively suppressing or amplifying responses depending on contextual
relevance. By mapping these principles onto the hierarchical control
architecture of microgrids, we propose a Sensorimotor Gating-Inspired
Neuro-Microgrid (SG-NMG) framework. In this architecture, PPI-like control
decisions correspond to protective damping in primary and secondary management
of microgrids, whereas PPF-like decisions correspond to adaptive amplification
of corrective control actions. The framework is presented through analytical
workflow design, neuro-circuitry analogies, and integration with machine
learning methods. Finally, open challenges and research directions are
outlined, including the mathematical modeling of gating, digital twin
validation, and cross-disciplinary collaboration between neuroscience and
industrial power systems. The resulting paradigm highlights sensorimotor gating
as a promising framework for designing self-protective, adaptive, and resilient
microgrids.

### [211] [Fix False Transparency by Noise Guided Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15736)
*Aly El Hakie,Yiren Lu,Yu Yin,Michael Jenkins,Yehe Liu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文识别并解决了3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）中虚假透明度的伪影问题，提出了一种名为NGS的方法，通过在训练过程中注入不透明噪声高斯来鼓励表面高斯获得更高不透明度，从而减少虚假透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS重建的不透明物体经常表现出虚假透明的表面，导致在交互式查看时背景和内部模式不一致。这个问题源于3DGS中缺乏对表面不透明度的明确约束，使得优化过程可能错误地为不透明区域分配透明度。

Method: 提出NGS策略，通过在物体体积中注入不透明噪声高斯来鼓励表面高斯采用更高的不透明度，仅需对现有泼溅过程进行最小修改。同时提出了基于透射率的度量来定量评估虚假透明度。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，NGS显著减少了虚假透明度，同时在标准渲染指标上保持了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: NGS方法有效解决了3DGS中的虚假透明度问题，通过最小化修改实现了更好的表面不透明度，同时保持了渲染质量。

Abstract: Opaque objects reconstructed by 3DGS often exhibit a falsely transparent
surface, leading to inconsistent background and internal patterns under camera
motion in interactive viewing. This issue stems from the ill-posed optimization
in 3DGS. During training, background and foreground Gaussians are blended via
alpha-compositing and optimized solely against the input RGB images using a
photometric loss. As this process lacks an explicit constraint on surface
opacity, the optimization may incorrectly assign transparency to opaque
regions, resulting in view-inconsistent and falsely transparent. This issue is
difficult to detect in standard evaluation settings but becomes particularly
evident in object-centric reconstructions under interactive viewing. Although
other causes of view-inconsistency have been explored recently, false
transparency has not been explicitly identified. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to identify, characterize, and develop solutions for this
artifact, an underreported artifact in 3DGS. Our strategy, NGS, encourages
surface Gaussians to adopt higher opacity by injecting opaque noise Gaussians
in the object volume during training, requiring only minimal modifications to
the existing splatting process. To quantitatively evaluate false transparency
in static renderings, we propose a transmittance-based metric that measures the
severity of this artifact. In addition, we introduce a customized, high-quality
object-centric scan dataset exhibiting pronounced transparency issues, and we
augment popular existing datasets with complementary infill noise specifically
designed to assess the robustness of 3D reconstruction methods to false
transparency. Experiments across multiple datasets show that NGS substantially
reduces false transparency while maintaining competitive performance on
standard rendering metrics, demonstrating its overall effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有语音治疗方法有限且昂贵，无法满足全球数百万患者的需求。现有神经网络方法虽然能检测语音障碍，但不提供治疗建议且能耗高，难以在低功耗设备上部署。

Method: 采用语音识别模块进行高精度语音转文本，利用脉冲驱动生成语言模型进行语音障碍模式分析和治疗练习生成，提供发音指导反馈，并通过REST API实现用户无缝交互。

Result: 实验结果显示SpikeVox在语音障碍识别方面平均达到88%的置信度，同时提供完整的治疗练习反馈。

Conclusion: SpikeVox提供了一个全面的节能语音治疗解决方案框架，有望解决全球语音治疗获取困难的问题。

Abstract: Speech disorders can significantly affect the patients capability to
communicate, learn, and socialize. However, existing speech therapy solutions
(e.g., therapist or tools) are still limited and costly, hence such solutions
remain inadequate for serving millions of patients worldwide. To address this,
state-of-the-art methods employ neural network (NN) algorithms to help
accurately detecting speech disorders. However, these methods do not provide
therapy recommendation as feedback, hence providing partial solution for
patients. Moreover, these methods incur high energy consumption due to their
complex and resource-intensive NN processing, hence hindering their deployments
on low-power/energy platforms (e.g., smartphones). Toward this, we propose
SpikeVox, a novel framework for enabling energy-efficient speech therapy
solutions through spike-driven generative language model. Specifically,
SpikeVox employs a speech recognition module to perform highly accurate
speech-to-text conversion; leverages a spike-driven generative language model
to efficiently perform pattern analysis for speech disorder detection and
generates suitable exercises for therapy; provides guidance on correct
pronunciation as feedback; as well as utilizes the REST API to enable seamless
interaction for users. Experimental results demonstrate that SpikeVox achieves
88% confidence level on average in speech disorder recognition, while providing
a complete feedback for therapy exercises. Therefore, SpikeVox provides a
comprehensive framework for energy-efficient speech therapy solutions, and
potentially addresses the significant global speech therapy access gap.

Abstract: This article presents a fully autonomous aerial masonry construction
framework using heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), supported by
experimental validation. Two specialized UAVs were developed for the task: (i)
a brick-carrier UAV equipped with a ball-joint actuation mechanism for precise
brick manipulation, and (ii) an adhesion UAV integrating a servo-controlled
valve and extruder nozzle for accurate adhesion application. The proposed
framework employs a reactive mission planning unit that combines a dependency
graph of the construction layout with a conflict graph to manage simultaneous
task execution, while hierarchical state machines ensure robust operation and
safe transitions during task execution. Dynamic task allocation allows
real-time adaptation to environmental feedback, while minimum-jerk trajectory
generation ensures smooth and precise UAV motion during brick pickup and
placement. Additionally, the brick-carrier UAV employs an onboard vision system
that estimates brick poses in real time using ArUco markers and a least-squares
optimization filter, enabling accurate alignment during construction. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first experimental
demonstration of fully autonomous aerial masonry construction using
heterogeneous UAVs, where one UAV precisely places the bricks while another
autonomously applies adhesion material between them. The experimental results
supported by the video showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework and
demonstrate its potential to serve as a foundation for future developments in
autonomous aerial robotic construction.

Conclusion: RM-RL框架有效解决了精确操作任务中的数据效率和稳定性问题，在真实环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Precise robot manipulation is critical for fine-grained applications such as
chemical and biological experiments, where even small errors (e.g., reagent
spillage) can invalidate an entire task. Existing approaches often rely on
pre-collected expert demonstrations and train policies via imitation learning
(IL) or offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, obtaining high-quality
demonstrations for precision tasks is difficult and time-consuming, while
offline RL commonly suffers from distribution shifts and low data efficiency.
We introduce a Role-Model Reinforcement Learning (RM-RL) framework that unifies
online and offline training in real-world environments. The key idea is a
role-model strategy that automatically generates labels for online training
data using approximately optimal actions, eliminating the need for human
demonstrations. RM-RL reformulates policy learning as supervised training,
reducing instability from distribution mismatch and improving efficiency. A
hybrid training scheme further leverages online role-model data for offline
reuse, enhancing data efficiency through repeated sampling. Extensive
experiments show that RM-RL converges faster and more stably than existing RL
methods, yielding significant gains in real-world manipulation: 53% improvement
in translation accuracy and 20% in rotation accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate
the successful execution of a challenging task, precisely placing a cell plate
onto a shelf, highlighting the framework's effectiveness where prior methods
fail.

Abstract: This article presents an extension of the Lagrange-Poincare Equations (LPE)
to model the dynamics of spacecraft-manipulator systems operating within a
non-inertial orbital reference frame. Building upon prior formulations of LPE
for vehicle-manipulator systems, the proposed framework, termed the
Lagrange-Poincare-Kepler Equations (LPKE), incorporates the coupling between
spacecraft attitude dynamics, orbital motion, and manipulator kinematics. The
formalism combines the Euler-Poincare equations for the base spacecraft,
Keplerian orbital dynamics for the reference frame, and reduced Euler-Lagrange
equations for the manipulator's shape space, using an exponential joint
parametrization. Leveraging the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle on principal
bundles, we derive novel closed-form structural matrices that explicitly
capture the effects of orbital disturbances and their dynamic coupling with the
manipulator system. The LPKE framework also systematically includes externally
applied, symmetry-breaking wrenches, allowing for immediate integration into
hardware-in-the-loop simulations and model-based control architectures for
autonomous robotic operations in the orbital environment. To illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model and its numerical superiority, we present a
simulation study analyzing orbital effects on a 7-degree-of-freedom manipulator

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for legged robots in complex and dynamic environments
relies on robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems to
accurately map surroundings and localize the robot, ensuring safe and efficient
operation. While prior sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches have integrated
various sensor modalities to improve their robustness, these algorithms are
still susceptible to estimation drift in challenging environments due to their
reliance on unsuitable fusion strategies. Therefore, we propose a robust
LiDAR-visual-inertial-kinematic odometry system that integrates information
from multiple sensors, such as a camera, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit
(IMU), and joint encoders, for visual and LiDAR-based odometry estimation. Our
system employs a fusion-based pose estimation approach that runs
optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) and filter-based
LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) based on measurement availability. In
VIKO, we utilize the footpreintegration technique and robust LiDAR-visual depth
consistency using superpixel clusters in a sliding window optimization. In
LIKO, we incorporate foot kinematics and employ a point-toplane residual in an
error-state iterative Kalman filter (ESIKF). Compared with other sensor
fusion-based SLAM algorithms, our approach shows robust performance across
public and longterm datasets.

Conclusion: PolyFly通过非保守表示和方向感知多面体建模，能够为空中运输机器人规划出更快、更精确的轨迹，在复杂约束环境中表现出色。

Abstract: Aerial transportation robots using suspended cables have emerged as versatile
platforms for disaster response and rescue operations. To maximize the
capabilities of these systems, robots need to aggressively fly through tightly
constrained environments, such as dense forests and structurally unsafe
buildings, while minimizing flight time and avoiding obstacles. Existing
methods geometrically over-approximate the vehicle and obstacles, leading to
conservative maneuvers and increased flight times. We eliminate these
restrictions by proposing PolyFly, an optimal global planner which considers a
non-conservative representation for aerial transportation by modeling each
physical component of the environment, and the robot (quadrotor, cable and
payload), as independent polytopes. We further increase the model accuracy by
incorporating the attitude of the physical components by constructing
orientation-aware polytopes. The resulting optimal control problem is
efficiently solved by converting the polytope constraints into smooth
differentiable constraints via duality theory. We compare our method against
the existing state-of-the-art approach in eight maze-like environments and show
that PolyFly produces faster trajectories in each scenario. We also
experimentally validate our proposed approach on a real quadrotor with a
suspended payload, demonstrating the practical reliability and accuracy of our
method.

Conclusion: 所提出的数学框架增强了无人机灾后响应的实用性，通过考虑现实因素如风力和无人机异构性，使任务更加高效有效。

Abstract: Natural and human-made disasters can cause severe devastation and claim
thousands of lives worldwide. Therefore, developing efficient methods for
disaster response and management is a critical task for relief teams. One of
the most essential components of effective response is the rapid collection of
information about affected areas, damages, and victims. More data translates
into better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives
saved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication
infrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely
difficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate
and assist them in time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as
valuable tools in such scenarios. In particular, a fleet of UAVs can be
dispatched from a mobile station to the affected area to facilitate data
collection and establish temporary communication networks. Nevertheless,
real-world deployment of UAVs faces several challenges, with adverse weather
conditions--especially wind--being among the most significant. To address this,
we develop a novel mathematical framework to determine the optimal location of
a mobile UAV station while explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the
UAVs and the effect of wind. In particular, we generalize the Sylvester problem
to introduce the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which captures
complex factors such as wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth
motion within a unified framework. The proposed framework enhances the
practicality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for
real-world factors such as wind and UAV heterogeneity. Experimental results
demonstrate that it can reduce wasted operational time by up to 84%, making
post-disaster missions significantly more efficient and effective.

Abstract: Autonomous Underwater vehicles must operate in strong currents, limited
acoustic bandwidth, and persistent sensing requirements where conventional
swarm optimisation methods are unreliable. This paper presents NOAH, a novel
nature-inspired swarm optimisation algorithm that combines current-aware drift,
irreversible settlement in persistent sensing nodes, and colony-based
communication. Drawing inspiration from the behaviour of barnacle nauplii, NOAH
addresses the critical limitations of existing swarm algorithms by providing
hydrodynamic awareness, irreversible anchoring mechanisms, and colony-based
communication capabilities essential for underwater exploration missions. The
algorithm establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable and
energy-efficient underwater swarm robotics with validated performance analysis.
Validation studies demonstrate an 86% success rate for permanent anchoring
scenarios, providing a unified formulation for hydrodynamic constraints and
irreversible settlement behaviours with an empirical study under flow.

Abstract: Scene graphs enhance 3D mapping capabilities in robotics by understanding the
relationships between different spatial elements, such as rooms and objects.
Recent research extends scene graphs to hierarchical layers, adding and
leveraging constraints across these levels. This approach is tightly integrated
with pose-graph optimization, improving both localization and mapping accuracy
simultaneously. However, when segmenting spatial characteristics, consistently
recognizing rooms becomes challenging due to variations in viewpoints and
limited field of view (FOV) of sensors. For example, existing real-time
approaches often over-segment large rooms into smaller, non-functional spaces
that are not useful for localization and mapping due to the time-dependent
method. Conversely, their voxel-based room segmentation method often
under-segment in complex cases like not fully enclosed 3D space that are
non-traversable for ground robots or humans, leading to false constraints in
pose-graph optimization. We propose a traversability-aware room segmentation
method that considers the interaction between robots and surroundings, with
consistent feasibility of traversability information. This enhances both the
semantic coherence and computational efficiency of pose-graph optimization.
Improved performance is demonstrated through the re-detection frequency of the
same rooms in a dataset involving repeated traversals of the same space along
the same path, as well as the optimization time consumption.

Abstract: Black-box simulators are widely used in robotics, but optimizing their
parameters remains challenging due to inaccessible likelihoods.
Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) tackles this issue using simulation-driven
approaches, estimating the posterior from offline real observations and forward
simulations. However, in black-box scenarios, preparing observations that
contain sufficient information for parameter estimation is difficult due to the
unknown relationship between parameters and observations. In this work, we
present Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI), a parameter estimation
framework that uses robots to actively collect real-world online data to
achieve accurate black-box simulator tuning. Our framework optimizes robot
actions to collect informative observations by maximizing information gain,
which is defined as the expected reduction in Shannon entropy between the
posterior and the prior. While calculating information gain requires the
likelihood, which is inaccessible in black-box simulators, our method solves
this problem by leveraging Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), which leverages a
neural network to learn the posterior estimator. Three simulation experiments
quantitatively verify that our method achieves accurate parameter estimation,
with posteriors sharply concentrated around the true parameters. Moreover, we
show a practical application using a real robot to estimate the simulation
parameters of cubic particles corresponding to two real objects, beads and
gravel, with a bucket pouring action.

Abstract: Reliable navigation in disaster-response and other unstructured indoor
settings requires robots not only to avoid obstacles but also to recognise when
those obstacles can be pushed aside. We present an adaptive, LiDAR and
odometry-based path-planning framework that embeds this capability into the
ROS2 Nav2 stack. A new Movable Obstacles Layer labels all LiDAR returns missing
from a prior static map as tentatively movable and assigns a reduced traversal
cost. A companion Slow-Pose Progress Checker monitors the ratio of commanded to
actual velocity; when the robot slows appreciably, the local cost is raised
from light to heavy, and on a stall to lethal, prompting the global planner to
back out and re-route. Gazebo evaluations on a Scout Mini, spanning isolated
objects and cluttered corridors, show higher goal-reach rates and fewer
deadlocks than a no-layer baseline, with traversal times broadly comparable.
Because the method relies only on planar scans and CPU-level computation, it
suits resource-constrained search and rescue robots and integrates into
heterogeneous platforms with minimal engineering. Overall, the results indicate
that interaction-aware cost maps are a lightweight, ROS2-native extension for
navigating among potentially movable obstacles in unstructured settings. The
full implementation will be released as open source

Abstract: Automating chicken shoulder deboning requires precise 6-DoF cutting through a
partially occluded, deformable, multi-material joint, since contact with the
bones presents serious health and safety risks. Our work makes both
systems-level and algorithmic contributions to train and deploy a reactive
force-feedback cutting policy that dynamically adapts a nominal trajectory and
enables full 6-DoF knife control to traverse the narrow joint gap while
avoiding contact with the bones. First, we introduce an open-source
custom-built simulator for multi-material cutting that models coupling,
fracture, and cutting forces, and supports reinforcement learning, enabling
efficient training and rapid prototyping. Second, we design a reusable physical
testbed to emulate the chicken shoulder: two rigid "bone" spheres with
controllable pose embedded in a softer block, enabling rigorous and repeatable
evaluation while preserving essential multi-material characteristics of the
target problem. Third, we train and deploy a residual RL policy, with
discretized force observations and domain randomization, enabling robust
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and the first demonstration of a learned policy
that debones a real chicken shoulder. Our experiments in our simulator, on our
physical testbed, and on real chicken shoulders show that our learned policy
reliably navigates the joint gap and reduces undesired bone/cartilage contact,
resulting in up to a 4x improvement over existing open-loop cutting baselines
in terms of success rate and bone avoidance. Our results also illustrate the
necessity of force feedback for safe and effective multi-material cutting. The

Abstract: In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant
challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision
making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving
that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges,
enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the
advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model
(VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the
driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future
observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are
represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on
current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted
state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and
trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions
generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an
actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning
pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art
performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop
planning.

Abstract: Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been
treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing
shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated
Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and
adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this
integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we
investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely
adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with
relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which
includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our
analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead
to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to
fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality
proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We
find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic
and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following
approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced
proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but
realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution
and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: VO-DP证明了仅视觉方法在机器人操作任务中的有效性，并在各种条件下保持高度稳定性，同时开源了支持多机多GPU训练的训练库。

Abstract: In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy
learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these
approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene
representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to
achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth
exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this
paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning
method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve
effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate
features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric
features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via
cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the
policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms
the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct
performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation
tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0%
and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%,
outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further
robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying
conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we
open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate,
this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as
mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP,
DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.

Motivation: 机械系统的名义性能常因未知扰动而下降，二自由度控制结构虽能解耦名义性能和扰动抑制，但当扰动动态未知时无法实现完美扰动抑制，存在跟踪速度与跟踪不确定性的固有权衡。

Conclusion: 所提出的两种方法在扰动估计方面表现出优越性，显著提升了外骨骼系统的跟踪精度。

Abstract: The nominal performance of mechanical systems is often degraded by unknown
disturbances. A two-degree-of-freedom control structure can decouple nominal
performance from disturbance rejection. However, perfect disturbance rejection
is unattainable when the disturbance dynamic is unknown. In this work, we
reveal an inherent trade-off in disturbance estimation subject to tracking
speed and tracking uncertainty. Then, we propose two novel methods to enhance
disturbance estimation: an interacting multiple model extended Kalman
filter-based disturbance observer and a multi-kernel correntropy extended
Kalman filter-based disturbance observer. Experiments on an exoskeleton verify
that the proposed two methods improve the tracking accuracy $36.3\%$ and
$16.2\%$ in hip joint error, and $46.3\%$ and $24.4\%$ in knee joint error,
respectively, compared to the extended Kalman filter-based disturbance
observer, in a time-varying interaction force scenario, demonstrating the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 让四足机器人在未知不确定性（如未知负载和不平坦地形）下自主执行复杂任务，实现真正的自主性。

Method: 使用随机傅里叶特征在再生核希尔伯特空间中近似残差动力学，然后基于当前学习到的残差动力学模型进行MPC控制，通过最小二乘法在线更新模型。

Result: 在Gazebo和MuJoCo仿真中验证了算法有效性，能够处理高达12倍重力的外部力、20度斜坡、0.25米高度变化的地形，以及8kg负载和时变地面摩擦系数。

Conclusion: 该算法具有次线性动态遗憾性能，在对抗未知干扰和建模误差方面表现出色，为实现自适应腿式运动提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We provide an algorithm for adaptive legged locomotion via online learning
and model predictive control. The algorithm is composed of two interacting
modules: model predictive control (MPC) and online learning of residual
dynamics. The residual dynamics can represent modeling errors and external
disturbances. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will
autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such
as unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier
features to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces. Then, it employs MPC based on the current learned model of the residual
dynamics. The model is updated online in a self-supervised manner using least
squares based on the data collected while controlling the quadruped. The
algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined as the
suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the
residual dynamics. We validate our algorithm in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations,
where the quadruped aims to track reference trajectories. The Gazebo
simulations include constant unknown external forces up to $12\boldsymbol{g}$,
where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is the gravity vector, in flat terrain, slope terrain
with $20\degree$ inclination, and rough terrain with $0.25m$ height variation.
The MuJoCo simulations include time-varying unknown disturbances with payload
up to $8~kg$ and time-varying ground friction coefficients in flat terrain.

Motivation: 为教育环境开发一个仅使用标准乐高零件和常见家庭设备的仿人机器人手，让儿童能够接触和学习现代机器人技术的前沿概念。

Result: 设计出能够自适应抓握各种物体的仿人机器人手，使用简单的驱动和控制机制，仅需乐高零件即可构建。

Conclusion: 该设计结合乐高的可访问性和先进机器人手概念，具有教育和启发儿童学习现代机器人技术的潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces an anthropomorphic robot hand built entirely using LEGO
MINDSTORMS: the Educational SoftHand-A, a tendon-driven, highly-underactuated
robot hand based on the Pisa/IIT SoftHand and related hands. To be suitable for
an educational context, the design is constrained to use only standard LEGO
pieces with tests using common equipment available at home. The hand features
dual motors driving an agonist/antagonist opposing pair of tendons on each
finger, which are shown to result in reactive fine control. The finger motions
are synchonized through soft synergies, implemented with a differential
mechanism using clutch gears. Altogether, this design results in an
anthropomorphic hand that can adaptively grasp a broad range of objects using a
simple actuation and control mechanism. Since the hand can be constructed from
LEGO pieces and uses state-of-the-art design concepts for robotic hands, it has
the potential to educate and inspire children to learn about the frontiers of
modern robotics.

*Manuel J. Fernandez,Alejandro Suarez,Anibal Ollero,Matteo Fumagalli*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种可变刚度连杆(VSL)用于长距离空中机械臂操作，能够在多旋翼平台和双机械臂之间实现可调节的机械耦合，在柔性和刚性之间切换以适应不同任务需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的长距离机械臂系统依赖刚性或缆绳连接，限制了精度或会将扰动传递给飞行器。需要一种能够根据任务要求调整刚度的机制。

Method: 在配备LiCAS双机械臂的四旋翼飞行器上集成了可变刚度连杆，通过遥操作实验评估系统性能，包括外部扰动和包裹运输任务。

Result: 改变连杆刚度显著改变了无人机与负载之间的动态交互。柔性配置衰减外部冲击和气动扰动，刚性配置提高了操作阶段的定位精度。

Conclusion: VSL增强了系统的多功能性和安全性，提供了可控的柔顺性与精度之间的权衡。未来工作将关注自主刚度调节、多绳配置和协作空中操作。

Abstract: This paper presents the integration of a Variable Stiffness Link (VSL) for
long-reach aerial manipulation, enabling adaptable mechanical coupling between
an aerial multirotor platform and a dual-arm manipulator. Conventional
long-reach manipulation systems rely on rigid or cable connections, which limit
precision or transmit disturbances to the aerial vehicle. The proposed VSL
introduces an adjustable stiffness mechanism that allows the link to behave
either as a flexible rope or as a rigid rod, depending on task requirements.
  The system is mounted on a quadrotor equipped with the LiCAS dual-arm
manipulator and evaluated through teleoperated experiments, involving external
disturbances and parcel transportation tasks. Results demonstrate that varying
the link stiffness significantly modifies the dynamic interaction between the
UAV and the payload. The flexible configuration attenuates external impacts and
aerodynamic perturbations, while the rigid configuration improves positional
accuracy during manipulation phases.
  These results confirm that VSL enhances versatility and safety, providing a
controllable trade-off between compliance and precision. Future work will focus
on autonomous stiffness regulation, multi-rope configurations, cooperative
aerial manipulation and user studies to further assess its impact on
teleoperated and semi-autonomous aerial tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级摄像头和视觉伺服的低成本3D超声成像方法，通过图像恢复和仿真循环优化解决遮挡和姿态估计问题，在多种模型上验证了其准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D超声成像依赖昂贵的跟踪系统，而基于神经网络的方法易受图像噪声和误差累积影响，需要一种成本效益高且精确的解决方案。

Method: 使用轻量级摄像头捕捉视觉反馈，引入图像恢复方法处理遮挡，开发仿真循环方法进行姿态估计，并通过视觉伺服控制器优化图像对齐。

Result: 在血管模型、圆锥模型和人体手臂上的验证显示，Hausdorff距离分别为0.359mm、1.171mm和0.858mm，证明了方法的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为自由手3D超声重建提供了一种可靠且成本效益高的解决方案，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Freehand 3D ultrasound (US) imaging using conventional 2D probes offers
flexibility and accessibility for diverse clinical applications but faces
challenges in accurate probe pose estimation. Traditional methods depend on
costly tracking systems, while neural network-based methods struggle with image
noise and error accumulation, compromising reconstruction precision. We propose
a cost-effective and versatile solution that leverages lightweight cameras and
visual servoing in simulated environments for precise 3D US imaging. These
cameras capture visual feedback from a textured planar workspace. To counter
occlusions and lighting issues, we introduce an image restoration method that
reconstructs occluded regions by matching surrounding texture patterns. For
pose estimation, we develop a simulation-in-the-loop approach, which replicates
the system setup in simulation and iteratively minimizes pose errors between
simulated and real-world observations. A visual servoing controller refines the
alignment of camera views, improving translational estimation by optimizing
image alignment. Validations on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical
model, and a human arm demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach,
with Hausdorff distances to the reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171
mm, and 0.858 mm, respectively. These results confirm the method's potential
for reliable freehand 3D US reconstruction.

TL;DR: HEADER是一种基于注意力机制的强化学习方法，使用分层图结构进行大规模环境中的高效自主机器人探索，在模拟和真实环境中都表现出优越的探索效率。


<details>

Motivation: 推动基于学习的方法在自主机器人探索中的边界，特别是在环境规模和探索效率方面，解决现有方法在大规模环境中的可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用基于注意力的强化学习框架，构建分层图表示机器人信念/地图，设计了新颖的基于社区的算法来构建和更新全局图，该算法具有完全增量、形状自适应和线性复杂度的特点。

Result: 在模拟的大规模探索场景中，HEADER比大多数现有学习和非学习方法具有更好的可扩展性，探索效率比最先进的基线方法提高了20%。在硬件部署中，成功验证了在300m*230m校园环境等复杂大规模真实场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: HEADER通过分层图表示、基于注意力的规划和参数自由特权奖励的结合，实现了在大规模环境中高效且可扩展的自主探索，为学习型探索方法设定了新的基准。

Abstract: This work pushes the boundaries of learning-based methods in autonomous robot
exploration in terms of environmental scale and exploration efficiency. We
present HEADER, an attention-based reinforcement learning approach with
hierarchical graphs for efficient exploration in large-scale environments.
HEADER follows existing conventional methods to construct hierarchical
representations for the robot belief/map, but further designs a novel
community-based algorithm to construct and update a global graph, which remains
fully incremental, shape-adaptive, and operates with linear complexity.
Building upon attention-based networks, our planner finely reasons about the
nearby belief within the local range while coarsely leveraging distant
information at the global scale, enabling next-best-viewpoint decisions that
consider multi-scale spatial dependencies. Beyond novel map representation, we
introduce a parameter-free privileged reward that significantly improves model
performance and produces near-optimal exploration behaviors, by avoiding
training objective bias caused by handcrafted reward shaping. In simulated
challenging, large-scale exploration scenarios, HEADER demonstrates better
scalability than most existing learning and non-learning methods, while
achieving a significant improvement in exploration efficiency (up to 20%) over
state-of-the-art baselines. We also deploy HEADER on hardware and validate it
in complex, large-scale real-life scenarios, including a 300m*230m campus
environment.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework for multi-robot
systems that integrate both spatial and temporal elements: Few-Shot
Demonstration-Driven Task Coordination and Trajectory Execution (DDACE). Our
approach leverages temporal graph networks for learning task-agnostic temporal
sequencing and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, ensuring
modularity and generalization across various tasks. By decoupling temporal and
spatial aspects, DDACE requires only a small number of demonstrations,
significantly reducing data requirements compared to traditional learning from
demonstration approaches. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted
extensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects
of multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action
dynamics, complex trajectory generation, and heterogeneous configurations. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves task
execution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across
dynamic and diverse settings. This work underscores the potential of modular
architectures in enhancing the practicality and scalability of multi-robot
systems in real-world applications. Additional materials are available at

real-to-sim pipeline uses reinforcement learning to train policies that control
an actuated MANO hand in physics simulation, reproducing human demonstrations
while discovering the underlying contact forces that generate the observed
object motion. DexCanvas is the first manipulation dataset to combine
large-scale real demonstrations, systematic skill coverage based on established
taxonomies, and physics-validated contact annotations. The dataset can
facilitate research in robotic manipulation learning, contact-rich control, and
skill transfer across different hand morphologies.

*Alana Renda,Jillian Ross,Michael Cafarella,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OpenEstimate是一个用于评估语言模型在不确定性下进行数值估计任务的多领域基准测试，发现前沿语言模型产生的先验分布通常不准确且过于自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中语言模型需要在信息不完整的情况下进行不确定性推理，但现有评估大多关注有明确答案的问题，缺乏对不确定性推理能力的系统评估。

Method: 开发了OpenEstimate基准测试，通过数值估计任务评估语言模型合成背景信息并表达概率先验的能力，评估这些先验的准确性和校准度。

Result: 在六个前沿语言模型上测试发现，模型产生的先验分布通常不准确且过于自信，性能在不同不确定性激发方式下略有改善，但基本不受采样策略、推理努力或提示设计变化的影响。

Conclusion: OpenEstimate为前沿语言模型提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台，有助于开发在概率估计和不确定性推理方面表现更好的模型。

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了深度强化学习在虚拟环境中让智能体既能生成又能解决内容的潜力，拓展了AI在创意游戏开发过程中的贡献边界。

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has become an increasingly popular
technique in game development, allowing developers to generate dynamic,
replayable, and scalable environments with reduced manual effort. In this
study, a novel method for procedural level design using Deep Reinforcement
Learning (DRL) within a Unity-based 3D environment is proposed. The system
comprises two agents: a hummingbird agent, acting as a solver, and a floating
island agent, responsible for generating and placing collectible objects
(flowers) on the terrain in a realistic and context-aware manner. The
hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战柏拉图表示假说，指出仅靠观察充分性无法保证干预能力，因为观测等价的世界在干预下可能产生分歧。

Method: 提出Causal Mechanics框架，将假设空间变化作为首要操作，引入局部性和自主性原则、独立因果机制和组合自主性原则等结构原则。

Result: 建立了使错误发现和修正可行的理论框架，提供了将不可达错误转化为可达错误的具体诊断方法。

Conclusion: AGI发展需要理论突破，Causal Mechanics为构建能够发现和修正错误的系统提供了理论支架。

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --
from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

Conclusion: HugAgent为评估机器推理与人类个体思维的对齐提供了首个可扩展基准，揭示了当前模型在捕捉个体推理演化方面的局限性，推动了更人性化AI推理的发展。

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as

Abstract: As autonomous agentic AI systems see increasing adoption across
organisations, persistent challenges in alignment, governance, and risk
management threaten to impede deployment at scale. We present AURA (Agent
aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify,
and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and
practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology
that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and
practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score,
evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,
synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)
communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic
systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with
established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实工作环境中大规模、纵向情绪识别数据集稀缺的问题，特别是在自然环境中收集长期情绪数据。

Method: 在真实办公环境中收集面部表情数据，使用深度学习进行情绪识别，计算32个扩展情绪指标，并进行技术验证和基线实验。

Result: 数据集成功复制已知心理模式（周末效应：效价提升192%，p<0.001），员工离职预测AUC=1.0，基线实验情绪分类准确率91.2%，效价预测R2=0.84。

Conclusion: 这是公开可用的最大、最长的纵向工作场所情绪数据集，支持情绪识别、情感动态建模、情绪传染、离职预测等研究。

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,
emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

Motivation: 随着GPT-4等大规模AI模型在关键领域部署，关于AI信任和透明度的问题日益紧迫，需要研究可解释性如何影响用户信任。

Method: 采用定量实验设计，通过基于网络的交互式贷款审批模拟，比较不同类型解释（从基本特征重要性到交互式反事实解释）对用户信任感知的影响。

Abstract: Large-scale AI models such as GPT-4 have accelerated the deployment of
artificial intelligence across critical domains including law, healthcare, and
finance, raising urgent questions about trust and transparency. This study
investigates the relationship between explainability and user trust in AI
systems through a quantitative experimental design. Using an interactive,
web-based loan approval simulation, we compare how different types of
explanations, ranging from basic feature importance to interactive
counterfactuals influence perceived trust. Results suggest that interactivity
enhances both user engagement and confidence, and that the clarity and
relevance of explanations are key determinants of trust. These findings
contribute empirical evidence to the growing field of human-centered
explainable AI, highlighting measurable effects of explainability design on
user perception

### [245] [From Checklists to Clusters: A Homeostatic Account of AGI Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15236)
*Brett Reynolds*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出AGI评估应使用非对称权重和持续性测试，将通用智能视为稳态属性集群，而非简单的多领域能力组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估存在两个问题：对称权重假设所有领域同等重要，而人类智能研究表明并非如此；快照测试无法区分持久能力和脆弱表现。

Method: 提出两个评估扩展：基于因果中心性的权重评分（导入CHC理论权重）和集群稳定性指数系列（评估配置持久性、持久学习和错误纠正）。

Result: 这些扩展保持了多领域广度，同时减少了脆弱性和博弈行为，提供了可测试的预测和黑盒协议。

Conclusion: 通用智能应被理解为稳态属性集群，AGI评估需要衡量能力在扰动下的共现机制，而非仅关注能力本身。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，从海量异构复杂关联的多维数据中提取深度洞察面临挑战。LLM存在幻觉问题且难以实时更新，知识图谱静态特性限制动态交互和分析能力

Method: 利用LLM智能体从非结构化数据自动提取产品数据，实时构建和可视化知识图谱，通过交互平台支持用户对图节点进行深度探索分析

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在产品生态系统分析、关系挖掘和用户驱动探索性分析方面具有显著优势

Conclusion: 为多维数据分析提供了新思路和工具，构建了动态协作的分析生态系统

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

TL;DR: KG-Agent是一个经验驱动的学习框架，通过构建状态-动作知识图谱来解决API缺失环境下LLM智能体在GUI交互中的效率瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件大多缺乏可访问的API，智能体只能通过像素级GUI进行操作，导致决策短视、依赖试错，阻碍技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 将原始像素交互结构化构建持久的状态-动作知识图谱(SA-KG)，通过连接功能相似但视觉不同的GUI状态形成经验邻域，设计基于图拓扑的混合内在奖励机制。

Result: 在Civilization V和Slay the Spire两个复杂GUI决策环境中，相比最先进方法在探索效率和战略深度方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: KG-Agent通过知识图谱结构化解耦战略规划与探索发现，有效解决了API缺失环境下LLM智能体的效率瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: AUGUSTUS是一个多模态代理系统，采用基于认知科学中人类记忆理念的图结构多模态上下文记忆，通过语义标签和上下文关联实现高效的概念驱动检索，在性能和速度上都优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理系统主要关注文本信息的存储，忽略了多模态信号的重要性。受人类记忆多模态特性的启发，作者希望开发一个符合认知科学中人类记忆理念的多模态代理系统。

Method: 系统包含四个循环阶段：编码（理解输入）、存储到记忆（保存重要信息）、检索（从记忆中搜索相关上下文）和执行（执行任务）。不同于使用向量数据库的传统方法，该系统将信息概念化为语义标签，并将其与上下文关联存储在图结构的多模态上下文记忆中，实现高效的概念驱动检索。

Result: AUGUSTUS在ImageNet分类任务中比传统多模态RAG方法快3.5倍，并在MSC基准测试中优于MemGPT。

Conclusion: 基于人类记忆认知理念的多模态代理系统AUGUSTUS在性能和效率上都显著优于传统的检索增强生成方法，证明了多模态记忆系统在代理系统中的重要性。

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Motivation: 随着LLM在编码和多模态理解方面的进展，需要更高质量的数据和更细粒度的评估方法来提升指令到HTML生成的性能。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：无界可扩展的代理爬虫框架、结构化分段数据表示（整合元数据、局部UI截图和JSON格式资源）、分段级多模态评估协议。

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and
multimodal understanding, we present WebGen-V, a new benchmark and framework
for instruction-to-HTML generation that enhances both data quality and
evaluation granularity. WebGen-V contributes three key innovations: (1) an
unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and
webpage generation to structured multimodal assessment.

TL;DR: VERITAS是一个通过整合视觉先验和多模态模型来提升监督微调数据质量的管道，能有效减少事实错误和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型的监督微调数据质量不足，存在事实错误和幻觉问题，主要原因是视觉感知能力不足。

Method: 利用视觉识别模型和OCR系统提取结构化视觉先验，结合三个先进LMM评估原始答案，通过统计融合得到高置信度共识分数，训练轻量级批评模型，最终生成精炼答案。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，使用VERITAS处理数据微调的模型性能显著优于使用原始数据的模型，特别是在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务中。

Conclusion: VERITAS能有效提升SFT数据质量，批评模型在保持高效的同时展现出与先进LMM相当的能力，为多模态数据优化研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

Motivation: 现有强化学习算法虽然能提高模型准确性，但会导致响应过长和过度思考问题，增加了推理延迟和计算消耗，特别是对于只需要简单推理的任务。

Method: DEPO框架包含三个核心组件：优势解耦算法指导模型减少低效token；难度感知长度惩罚降低整体响应长度；优势裁剪方法防止策略优化偏差。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B和1.5B模型上，DEPO将序列长度减少了39%，减少了低效token中的过度推理路径，同时在整体准确性上超越了基础模型。

Conclusion: DEPO框架能有效减少大型推理模型的低效推理，在保持准确性的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Motivation: 模拟集成电路布局在采用机器学习技术方面受到限制，主要原因是电气和特定问题约束的严格要求，以及布局规划和路由步骤的相互依赖性。布局工程师需要现成的路由感知布局解决方案。

Method: 开发基于强化学习和关系图卷积神经网络的自动布局引擎，结合增加的网格分辨率和精确引脚信息集成，以及动态路由资源估计技术，平衡路由和面积效率。

Result: 在模拟环境中，与过去基于学习的最先进技术相比，该方法实现了13.8%的死区减少、40.6%的线长减少和73.4%的路由成功率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能够满足工业标准，为模拟集成电路布局提供了有效的路由感知解决方案，显著改善了布局质量和路由成功率。

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

### [253] [Corrigibility Transformation: Constructing Goals That Accept Updates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15395)
*Rubi Hudson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了可修正性（corrigibility）的概念，即AI目标不会激励其避免目标更新或关闭。作者开发了一种转换方法，可以将任何可修正的目标转换为可修正版本而不牺牲性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI在部分学习目标后往往会抵制进一步的目标更新，因为大多数目标在继续追求时更容易实现。可修正性对于训练收敛、纠正错误和适应人类偏好变化至关重要，但目前缺乏既具可修正性又与不可修正替代方案相竞争的目标规范。

Method: 首先形式化定义可修正性，然后引入一种转换方法，通过短视地获取在无成本阻止更新条件下的奖励预测来构建任何可修正目标的修正版本。该方法可递归扩展到由可修正代理创建的新代理，并防止代理故意修改其目标。

Result: 两个网格世界实验证明，这些可修正目标可以有效地学习，并产生期望的行为。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种构建可修正AI目标的方法，既保持了性能又确保了安全性，为AI安全提供了重要工具。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然强化学习在单智能体任务中能有效提升推理能力，但在多轮次、多智能体场景中的应用仍待探索，主要挑战包括长时程信用分配和智能体特定优势估计。

Result: 从Qwen3-4B训练的MARS智能体在保留游戏中实现了最高28.7%的性能提升，在推理基准测试中多智能体系统性能持续提升，在AIME上提升10.0%，在GPQA-Diamond上提升12.5%。

Conclusion: 在战略游戏中通过自博弈进行端到端RL训练是开发LLM中可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as

relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent
orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive
Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational
ability. The system is built with LangGraph for workflow management, supports
both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and

Motivation: 现有方法在强化学习中面临判断不一致性问题，特别是偏好循环等逻辑一致性问题尚未得到充分解决，这会破坏强化学习的稳定性。

Method: 引入CDR指标量化判断冲突，提出DGR框架构建偏好图，将其转换为无冲突的有向无环图(DAG)，生成逻辑一致的奖励信号。

Result: 实验结果表明该框架相比强基线显著提升了训练稳定性和模型性能。

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性是AI反馈中关键且现在可管理的维度，该框架成功解决了判断不一致性问题。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

TL;DR: 提出MM-HCAN多模态超图对比注意力网络，用于工业感应电机多故障诊断，在三个真实基准测试中达到99.82%准确率，具有强跨域泛化能力和噪声鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以捕捉复杂多模态信号关系，局限于单模态数据或单一故障类型，且在噪声或跨域条件下性能下降。需要开发能同时诊断轴承、定子和转子故障的稳健诊断框架。

Method: MM-HCAN首次将对比学习集成到专为多模态传感器融合设计的超图拓扑中，联合建模模态内和模态间依赖关系，超越欧几里得嵌入空间增强泛化能力。

Result: 在三个真实基准测试中达到99.82%准确率，表现出强跨域泛化能力和噪声鲁棒性，消融研究验证了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: MM-HCAN为全面多故障诊断提供了可扩展且稳健的解决方案，支持工业环境中的预测性维护和延长资产寿命。

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

*Jiayuan Bai,Xuan-guang Pan,Chongyang Tao,Shuai Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JudgeSQL是一个用于Text-to-SQL任务中候选查询选择的框架，通过结构化推理和加权共识锦标赛机制解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SQL候选选择方法（如自一致性或最佳N解码）仅提供浅层信号，容易产生不一致评分、脆弱推理链，且无法捕捉语义细微差异。

Method: 开发基于推理的SQL判断模型，通过强化学习提炼可验证奖励的推理轨迹；采用加权共识锦标赛整合显式推理偏好和隐式生成器置信度。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，JudgeSQL展现出优越的SQL判断能力、良好的跨尺度泛化性以及对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL通过结构化推理和加权共识机制，为SQL候选选择提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个机器学习框架，整合患者历史就诊信息来改进健康监测，特别是在历史就诊数据有限且频率不固定的情况下。应用于前列腺癌风险预测，显著降低了假阳性率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学中的时间背景对于评估患者健康状况随时间变化很有价值，特别是在历史就诊数据有限且频率可变的情况下，需要整合多样化的历史背景信息来改进健康监测。

Method: 模型首先使用最近一次就诊的医疗数据估计初始疾病风险，然后利用从先前收集的影像学和/或临床生物标志物中提取的信息来完善评估。

Result: 整合历史背景直接将假阳性转为真阴性，在保持高灵敏度的同时提高了总体特异性。整合最多三次先前影像检查信息后，假阳性率从51%降至33%，加入临床数据后进一步降至24%。预测五年内风险时，假阳性率从64%降至9%。

Conclusion: 随时间收集的信息提供了相关背景，可增强医学风险预测的特异性。对于各种进展性疾病，通过背景信息充分降低假阳性率，可为低基线风险的大规模人群扩展纵向健康监测项目，实现早期检测和改善健康结果。

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出Thoth模型和"Sketch-and-Fill"范式，通过结构化协议生成提升科学实验的可重复性，在多个基准测试中超越现有LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型生成的实验协议往往不完整或不一致，限制了其在科学实验可重复性方面的实用性。

Method: 引入SciRecipe数据集（12K结构化协议），提出"Sketch-and-Fill"范式分离分析、结构和表达，采用基于组件的奖励机制评估步骤粒度、行动顺序和语义保真度。

Result: Thoth模型在多个基准测试中持续超越专有和开源LLMs，在步骤对齐、逻辑排序和语义准确性方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的科学助手铺平了道路，能够将知识与实验执行相连接。

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

TL;DR: 本文针对RLHF和DPO方法中忽略人类评估者多样性和二元反馈局限性的问题，提出了基于排名反馈和异质偏好的对齐框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF和DPO方法假设统一的标注者偏好并依赖二元比较，忽视了人类评估者的多样性和成对反馈的局限性。

Method: 1) 将偏好学习与计量经济学文献联系，证明二元比较不足以识别潜在用户偏好；2) 开发EM-DPO方法发现潜在标注者类型并训练混合LLM；3) 提出基于最小最大遗憾公平准则的聚合算法。

Result: 建立了生成模型对齐中面向多样化用户的公平性和个性化理论算法框架。

Conclusion: 通过排名反馈和异质偏好建模，为生成模型对齐提供了更公平和个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

Abstract: This paper presents methods for extracting structured information from
invoice documents and proposes a set of evaluation metrics (EM) to assess the
accuracy of the extracted data against annotated ground truth. The approach
involves pre-processing scanned or digital invoices, applying Docling and
LlamaCloud Services to identify and extract key fields such as invoice number,
date, total amount, and vendor details. To ensure the reliability of the
extraction process, we establish a robust evaluation framework comprising
field-level precision, consistency check failures, and exact match accuracy.
The proposed metrics provide a standardized way to compare different extraction
methods and highlight strengths and weaknesses in field-specific performance.

TL;DR: 提出了首个将多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题的帕金森病评估系统TRIP，解决了传统多模态方法在训练时需要同步所有模态、推理时依赖所有模态的限制，并处理了模态崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态帕金森病评估方法存在两个主要限制：(1)训练时需要同步所有模态数据，(2)推理时依赖所有模态数据，这阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 将多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题，引入基于边界的类别重平衡策略来处理模态内不平衡问题，支持训练和推理时更灵活的模态要求。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，TRIP在异步设置下比最佳基线分别提升了16.48、6.89和11.55个百分点，在同步设置下提升了4.86和2.30个百分点，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: TRIP框架有效解决了多模态帕金森病评估中的模态同步和依赖问题，具有出色的有效性和适应性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在复杂多维度问题中缺乏通过经验发展专业知识的内生机制的问题。

Method: 使用Dialectica框架，让代理在定义的主题上进行结构化对话，结合记忆、自我反思和策略约束的上下文编辑，将讨论视为隐式元强化学习过程。

Conclusion: 对话驱动的上下文演化是在开放不可验证领域中实现目标专业知识放大的实用路径。

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research
agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and
synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow
retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce

signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction
adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further
enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool
