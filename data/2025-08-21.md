### [1] [A comparative study of some wavelet and sampling operators on various features of an image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14043)
*Digvijay Singh,Rahul Shukla,Karunesh Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了多种正采样Kantorovich算子（SK算子）及其收敛性质，包括SK、高斯、双边和阈值小波算子，分析了局部和全局逼近特性，通过数值实验验证了基本逼近定理，并比较了不同算子在图像处理中的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多种采样Kantorovich算子的收敛性质和逼近能力，为图像处理中的算子选择提供理论依据和实验验证，特别是在非理想条件下不同算子对图像不同特征的适应性。

Method: 采用理论分析和数值实验相结合的方法，引入基本逼近定理，测量MSE、SI、SSI、SMPI、ENL等数学参数，通过表格形式展示理想条件下的算子性能，并使用2D Shepp-Logan Phantom图像进行ROI分析。

Result: 研究发现不同算子对图像不同特征具有各自的优势，在非理想条件下，某些算子对特定图像特征表现良好，而其他算子则表现不佳，验证了基本逼近定理的正确性。

Conclusion: 各种采样Kantorovich算子在图像处理中各有其重要性，需要根据图像的具体特征和非理想条件选择适当的算子，没有单一最优算子适用于所有情况。

Abstract: This research includes the study of some positive sampling Kantorovich
operators (SK operators) and their convergence properties. A comprehensive
analysis of both local and global approximation properties is presented using
sampling Kantorovich (SK), Gaussian, Bilateral and the thresholding
wavelet-based operators in the framework of SK-operators. Explicitly, we start
the article by introducing the basic terminology and state the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA) by imposing the various required conditions
corresponding to the various defined operators. We measure the error and study
the other mathematical parameters such as the mean square error (MSE), the
speckle index (SI), the speckle suppression index (SSI), the speckle mean
preservation index (SMPI), and the equivalent number of looks (ENL) at various
levels of resolution parameters. The nature of these operators are demonstrated
via an example under ideal conditions in tabulated form at a certain level of
samples. Eventually, another numerical example is illustrated to discuss the
region of interest (ROI) via SI, SSI and SMPI of 2D Shepp-Logan Phantom taken
slice from the 3D image, which gives the justification of the fundamental
theorem of approximation (FTA). At the end of the derivation and illustrations
we observe that the various operators have their own significance while
studying the various features of the image because of the uneven nature of an
image (non-ideal condition). Therefore, to some extent, some operators work
well and some do not for some specific features of the image.

### [2] [Federated Action Recognition for Smart Worker Assistance Using FastPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14113)
*Vinit Hegiste,Vidit Goyal,Tatjana Legler,Martin Ruskowski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于联邦学习的骨架动作识别框架，在保护隐私的同时显著提升了跨用户的模型通用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能制造环境中需要准确实时的工人动作识别，但传统的集中式识别方法在隐私敏感场景中不实用，需要一种能够保护数据隐私的解决方案。

Method: 构建了一个联邦学习框架，使用自定义的工业相关上身手势数据集，采用修改的FastPose模型进行骨架处理，并比较了LSTM和Transformer编码器两种时间背榜。评估了四种训练范式：集中式、本地化、加权联邦平均和联邦集成学习。

Result: 在全局测试集上，联邦学习Transformer模型比集中式训练提高了12.4%，联邦集成学习提高了16.3%。在未见的外部客户端上，联邦学习和联邦集成分别超过集中式识别精度了52.6%和58.3%。

Conclusion: 联邦学习不仅能够保护数据隐私，还能显著提升模型在异构工业环境中的跨用户通用性，为可扩展、隐私意识的人类动作识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In smart manufacturing environments, accurate and real-time recognition of
worker actions is essential for productivity, safety, and human-machine
collaboration. While skeleton-based human activity recognition (HAR) offers
robustness to lighting, viewpoint, and background variations, most existing
approaches rely on centralized datasets, which are impractical in
privacy-sensitive industrial scenarios. This paper presents a federated
learning (FL) framework for pose-based HAR using a custom skeletal dataset of
eight industrially relevant upper-body gestures, captured from five
participants and processed using a modified FastPose model. Two temporal
backbones, an LSTM and a Transformer encoder, are trained and evaluated under
four paradigms: centralized, local (per-client), FL with weighted federated
averaging (FedAvg), and federated ensemble learning (FedEnsemble). On the
global test set, the FL Transformer improves over centralized training by +12.4
percentage points, with FedEnsemble delivering a +16.3 percentage points gain.
On an unseen external client, FL and FedEnsemble exceed centralized accuracy by
+52.6 and +58.3 percentage points, respectively. These results demonstrate that
FL not only preserves privacy but also substantially enhances cross-user
generalization, establishing it as a practical solution for scalable,
privacy-aware HAR in heterogeneous industrial settings.

*Lianghui Zhu,Bin Ouyang,Yuxuan Zhang,Tianheng Cheng,Rui Hu,Haocheng Shen,Longjin Ran,Xiaoxin Chen,Li Yu,Wenyu Liu,Xinggang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LENS是一个基于强化学习的端到端框架，通过联合优化推理过程和分割任务，在文本提示图像分割中实现了更好的泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的监督微调方法在测试时忽略了显式的思维链推理，限制了模型对未见提示和领域的泛化能力

Method: 提出统一的强化学习奖励机制，涵盖句子级、边界框级和分割级线索，鼓励模型生成信息丰富的思维链推理同时提升掩码质量

Result: 在RefCOCO系列基准测试中平均cIoU达到81.2%，比GLaMM方法提升高达5.6%

Conclusion: 强化学习驱动的思维链推理为文本提示分割提供了强大的先验，是实现更通用分割模型的有效途径

Abstract: Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding
and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and
robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore
explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their
ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we
introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly
optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We
propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and
segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT
rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available
3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS
achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg
benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to
5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust
prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more
generalizable Segment Anything models. Code is available at
https://github.com/hustvl/LENS.

TL;DR: 提出深度均衡规范化器(DEC)来解决计算机视觉中的尺度变化问题，通过改善模型的局部尺度等变性来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉中同一类别的物体可能具有不同尺寸，且感知尺寸受相机距离影响，这些局部尺度变化是重要挑战

Method: 开发深度均衡规范化器(DEC)，可轻松集成到现有网络架构中，并能适配预训练模型

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，DEC提升了ViT、DeiT、Swin和BEiT四种流行预训练模型的性能和局部尺度一致性

Conclusion: DEC是处理尺度变化的有效方法，能显著改善深度学习模型的尺度等变性和整体性能

Abstract: Scale variation is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Objects of the
same class can have different sizes, and their perceived size is further
affected by the distance from the camera. These variations are local to the
objects, i.e., different object sizes may change differently within the same
image. To effectively handle scale variations, we present a deep equilibrium
canonicalizer (DEC) to improve the local scale equivariance of a model. DEC can
be easily incorporated into existing network architectures and can be adapted
to a pre-trained model. Notably, we show that on the competitive ImageNet
benchmark, DEC improves both model performance and local scale consistency
across four popular pre-trained deep-nets, e.g., ViT, DeiT, Swin, and BEiT. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ashiq24/local-scale-equivariance.

Abstract: We introduce RynnEC, a video multimodal large language model designed for
embodied cognition. Built upon a general-purpose vision-language foundation
model, RynnEC incorporates a region encoder and a mask decoder, enabling
flexible region-level video interaction. Despite its compact architecture,
RynnEC achieves state-of-the-art performance in object property understanding,
object segmentation, and spatial reasoning. Conceptually, it offers a
region-centric video paradigm for the brain of embodied agents, providing
fine-grained perception of the physical world and enabling more precise
interactions. To mitigate the scarcity of annotated 3D datasets, we propose an
egocentric video based pipeline for generating embodied cognition data.
Furthermore, we introduce RynnEC-Bench, a region-centered benchmark for
evaluating embodied cognitive capabilities. We anticipate that RynnEC will
advance the development of general-purpose cognitive cores for embodied agents
and facilitate generalization across diverse embodied tasks. The code, model
checkpoints, and benchmark are available at:

*Tinghan Yang,Md Ashiqur Rahman,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIPSym利用CLIP视觉语言模型的预训练能力，通过语义感知提示分组和旋转等变解码器来检测旋转和反射对称性，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对称性是计算机视觉中最基本的几何线索之一，但检测对称性一直是个挑战。研究利用CLIP预训练模型中的自然图像描述来获取额外的对称性线索。

Method: 提出CLIPSym方法，结合CLIP的图像和语言编码器，使用基于Transformer和G-卷积的旋转等变解码器。开发了语义感知提示分组(SAPG)技术来聚合多样化的对象提示。

Result: 在三个标准对称性检测数据集(DENDI、SDRW、LDRS)上超越了当前最先进的方法。消融实验验证了CLIP预训练、等变解码器和SAPG技术的有效性。

Conclusion: CLIPSym成功利用预训练的视觉语言模型来提升对称性检测性能，证明了语义线索在几何任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,
and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in
vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP
model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues
found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages
CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on
a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection
symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel
prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which
aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate
the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym
outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection
datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations
verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant
decoder, and the SAPG technique. The code is available at

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) has emerged as a pivotal task in computer
vision, with broad relevance across multiple fields. Recent advances in deep
learning have driven significant progress in this area, yet the field remains
fragmented across domains and learning paradigms. This survey offers a
comprehensive perspective on VAD, systematically organizing the literature

considerations. In doing so, we identify fundamental contributions and
limitations of current methodologies. By consolidating insights from subfields,
we aim to provide the community with a structured foundation for advancing both
theoretical understanding and real-world applicability of VAD systems. This
survey aims to support researchers by providing a useful reference, while also
drawing attention to the broader set of open challenges in anomaly detection,
including both fundamental research questions and practical obstacles to
real-world deployment.

### [8] [Accelerating Image Classification with Graph Convolutional Neural Networks using Voronoi Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14218)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合Voronoi图和图卷积网络(GCN)的创新图像分类框架NVGCN，通过图结构表示图像并利用Delaunay三角剖分简化处理，在多个基准数据集上实现了预处理时间和分类准确率的显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理复杂数据结构时存在局限性，需要探索新的范式来处理图像中的关系数据。Voronoi图和图卷积网络结合能够更好地建模像素或区域之间的空间关系。

Method: 使用基于图的图像表示方法，将像素或区域视为图顶点，通过对应的Delaunay三角剖分进行简化。提出了归一化Voronoi图卷积网络(NVGCN)，相比常规GCN速度更快。

Abstract: Recent advances in image classification have been significantly propelled by
the integration of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), offering a novel
paradigm for handling complex data structures. This study introduces an
innovative framework that employs GCNs in conjunction with Voronoi diagrams to
peform image classification, leveraging their exceptional capability to model
relational data. Unlike conventional convolutional neural networks, our
approach utilizes a graph-based representation of images, where pixels or
regions are treated as vertices of a graph, which are then simplified in the
form of the corresponding Delaunay triangulations. Our model yields significant
improvement in pre-processing time and classification accuracy on several
benchmark datasets, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models, especially in
scenarios that involve complex scenes and fine-grained categories. The
experimental results, validated via cross-validation, underscore the potential
of integrating GCNs with Voronoi diagrams in advancing image classification
tasks. This research contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach
to image classification, while opening new avenues for developing graph-based
learning paradigms in other domains of computer vision and non-structured data.
In particular, we have proposed a new version of the GCN in this paper, namely
normalized Voronoi Graph Convolution Network (NVGCN), which is faster than the
regular GCN.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have gained impressive performance due to
their outstanding capability in various understanding tasks. However, these
models still suffer from some fundamental limitations related to robustness and
generalization due to the alignment and correlation between visual and textual
features. In this paper, we introduce a simple but efficient learning mechanism
for improving the robust alignment between visual and textual modalities by
solving shuffling problems. In particular, the proposed approach can improve
reasoning capability, visual understanding, and cross-modality alignment by
introducing two new tasks: reconstructing the image order and the text order
into the LMM's pre-training and fine-tuning phases. In addition, we propose a
new directed-token approach to capture visual and textual knowledge, enabling
the capability to reconstruct the correct order of visual inputs. Then, we
introduce a new Image-to-Response Guided loss to further improve the visual
understanding of the LMM in its responses. The proposed approach consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance compared with prior LMMs on
academic task-oriented and instruction-following LMM benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了不同数据增强策略对糖尿病视网膜病变分级中保形预测器性能的影响，发现样本混合策略(Mixup和CutMix)不仅能提高预测准确性，还能产生更可靠和高效的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在糖尿病视网膜病变分级等高风险任务中需要可靠的不确定性量化。虽然保形预测能提供统计保证的预测集，但标准训练实践(如数据增强)与这些保证有效性之间的相互作用尚不明确。

Method: 使用DDR数据集，评估两种骨干架构(ResNet-50和CoaT)在五种增强策略下的表现：无增强、标准几何变换、CLAHE、Mixup和CutMix，分析对保形预测指标的影响。

Result: 样本混合策略(Mixup和CutMix)不仅提高了预测准确性，还产生了更可靠和高效的不确定性估计。而CLAHE等方法可能对模型确定性产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 需要将增强策略与下游不确定性量化协同设计，以构建真正值得信赖的医学影像AI系统。

Abstract: The clinical deployment of deep learning models for high-stakes tasks such as
diabetic retinopathy (DR) grading requires demonstrable reliability. While
models achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of
robust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a
distribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical
guarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training
practices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not
well understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different
data augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for
DR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --
ResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under
five augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,
CLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal
metrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup
and CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable
and efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can
negatively impact model certainty. These findings highlight the need to
co-design augmentation strategies with downstream uncertainty quantification in
mind to build genuinely trustworthy AI systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: Despite the growing importance of dental CBCT scans for diagnosis and
treatment planning, generating anatomically realistic scans with fine-grained
control remains a challenge in medical image synthesis. In this work, we
propose a novel conditional diffusion framework for 3D dental volume
generation, guided by tooth-level binary attributes that allow precise control
over tooth presence and configuration. Our approach integrates wavelet-based
denoising diffusion, FiLM conditioning, and masked loss functions to focus
learning on relevant anatomical structures. We evaluate the model across
diverse tasks, such as tooth addition, removal, and full dentition synthesis,
using both paired and distributional similarity metrics. Results show strong
fidelity and generalization with low FID scores, robust inpainting performance,
and SSIM values above 0.91 even on unseen scans. By enabling realistic,
localized modification of dentition without rescanning, this work opens
opportunities for surgical planning, patient communication, and targeted data
augmentation in dental AI workflows. The codes are available at:

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and understanding have gained increasing popularity,
yet existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained, language-aware 3D
representations from 2D images. In this paper, we present GALA, a novel
framework for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding with 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS). GALA distills a scene-specific 3D instance feature field via
self-supervised contrastive learning. To extend to generalized language feature
fields, we introduce the core contribution of GALA, a cross-attention module
with two learnable codebooks that encode view-independent semantic embeddings.
This design not only ensures intra-instance feature similarity but also
supports seamless 2D and 3D open-vocabulary queries. It reduces memory
consumption by avoiding per-Gaussian high-dimensional feature learning.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate GALA's remarkable
open-vocabulary performance on both 2D and 3D.

Abstract: Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP
involves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that
justify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on
prompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text
encoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,
prior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales
that fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In
this work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition
benchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple
ground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more
comprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of
previous approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)
framework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image
embeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,
our framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict
accurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on
the multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong
zero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy
and rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more
complete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object
recognition. The code will be made available online.

Abstract: Accurate detection of vascular occlusions during endovascular thrombectomy
(EVT) is critical in acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Interpretation of digital
subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences poses challenges due to anatomical
complexity and time constraints. This work proposes OccluNet, a spatio-temporal
deep learning model that integrates YOLOX, a single-stage object detector, with
transformer-based temporal attention mechanisms to automate occlusion detection
in DSA sequences. We compared OccluNet with a YOLOv11 baseline trained on
either individual DSA frames or minimum intensity projections. Two
spatio-temporal variants were explored for OccluNet: pure temporal attention
and divided space-time attention. Evaluation on DSA images from the MR CLEAN
Registry revealed the model's capability to capture temporally consistent
features, achieving precision and recall of 89.02% and 74.87%, respectively.
OccluNet significantly outperformed the baseline models, and both attention
variants attained similar performance. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了满足AI队友、可控NPC、个性化直播和辅助测试等新兴需求，需要开发能够通过像素输入泛化到新游戏、减少游戏特定工程的智能体。

Method: 使用端到端行为克隆训练，结合人工标注的游戏演示和通过逆动力学模型标注动作的未标记公开视频，采用解码器Transformer架构实现自回归动作输出。

Result: 在简单Roblox和经典MS-DOS游戏中表现出色，通过未标记数据消融实验验证了方法有效性，具备向专家级文本条件控制扩展的潜力。

Conclusion: P2P0.1展示了通过像素输入学习游戏玩法的可行性，为构建通用游戏AI奠定了基础，未来可通过扩展训练和评估实现专家级控制能力。

Abstract: We introduce Pixels2Play-0.1 (P2P0.1), a foundation model that learns to play
a wide range of 3D video games with recognizable human-like behavior. Motivated
by emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,
personalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must
rely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles
with minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with
behavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human
game-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute
actions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with
auto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining
latency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results
showing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,
ablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps
required to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动驾驶视频生成方法主要专注于RGB视频生成，缺乏多模态生成能力。然而深度图和语义图等多模态数据对于自动驾驶的整体场景理解至关重要。使用多个模型生成不同模态会增加部署难度且无法利用多模态数据的互补线索。

Conclusion: 该方法在统一框架内实现了多模态多视角驾驶场景视频的生成，为自动驾驶提供了更全面的场景理解能力，解决了多模态生成的技术挑战。

Abstract: Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for
autonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving
primarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support
multi-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and
semantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous
driving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different
modalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not
leverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this
problem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video
generation approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified
diffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and
modal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to
encode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion
model for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is
capable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified
framework. Our experiments on the challenging real-world autonomous driving
dataset, nuScenes, show that our approach can generate multi-modal multi-view
urban scene videos with high fidelity and controllability, surpassing the
state-of-the-art methods.

*Dian Ning,Dong Seog Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于类别间空间关系的损失函数(ICR loss)，通过利用大物体引导小物体检测，解决了IoU损失在小目标检测中梯度更新不足的问题，在车牌检测任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IoU-based损失函数在小物体检测中存在梯度更新不足的问题，因为小物体的梯度极其平坦，在多目标更新过程中小物体的梯度学习受到严重影响。

Method: 提出inter-class relational loss，利用物体间的空间关系（如车牌与汽车的附着关系），当预测的小物体不在其关联的大物体内部时添加惩罚损失，惩罚值与重叠面积成反比。

Result: 在SVMLP数据集上，YOLOv12-T的mAP50提升10.3%，UAV-DETR提升1.6%，无需额外超参数调优。

Conclusion: ICR损失可以轻松集成到现有IoU-based损失中，通过利用类别间空间关系有效提升小物体检测性能，特别是在车牌检测等应用中表现优异。

Abstract: In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union
(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets
during training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the
gradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update
of multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more
because of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class
relational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not
sacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact
that an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate
is attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's
bounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the
learning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's
and predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship
at the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger
objects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,
we present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:
(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse
real-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class
relational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.
We highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing
IoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the
standard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%
in mAP$^{\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without
any additional hyperparameter tuning. Code and dataset will be available soon.

accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art results for the LSFB and DiSPLaY
datasets using our Mamba-SL and Transformer-SL classifiers. Our findings reveal
that synthetic data pretraining outperforms traditional augmentation methods in
some cases and yields complementary benefits when implemented alongside them.
Our approach democratizes sign generation and synthetic data pretraining for
SLR by providing computationally efficient methods that achieve significant

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏公开的数据集和自动化方法来监测Taxol在细胞层面的效果，现有检测方法需要专业设备和复杂的样品处理，成本高且不适合高速或实时分析。

Method: 构建了一个包含不同Taxol浓度处理的C6脑研细胞微粒镜图像数据集，并提出ResAttention-KNN模型，结合ResNet-50、卷积注意力模块和k近邻分类器。

Result: 设计的模型通过注意力精炼和非参数分类提高了模型的稳健性和可解释性，为Taxol浓度分类提供了有效解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了Taxol细胞形态分析方面的数据空白，提供的数据集和基线模型为视觉基图像生物医学分析预了基础，支持可复现性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Monitoring the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent Taxol at the cellular
level is critical for both clinical evaluation and biomedical research.
However, existing detection methods require specialized equipment, skilled
personnel, and extensive sample preparation, making them expensive,
labor-intensive, and unsuitable for high-throughput or real-time analysis. Deep
learning approaches have shown great promise in medical and biological image
analysis, enabling automated, high-throughput assessment of cellular
morphology. Yet, no publicly available dataset currently exists for automated
morphological analysis of cellular responses to Taxol exposure. To address this
gap, we introduce a new microscopy image dataset capturing C6 glioma cells
treated with varying concentrations of Taxol. To provide an effective solution
for Taxol concentration classification and establish a benchmark for future
studies on this dataset, we propose a baseline model named ResAttention-KNN,
which combines a ResNet-50 with Convolutional Block Attention Modules and uses
a k-Nearest Neighbors classifier in the learned embedding space. This model
integrates attention-based refinement and non-parametric classification to
enhance robustness and interpretability. Both the dataset and implementation
are publicly released to support reproducibility and facilitate future research
in vision-based biomedical analysis.

Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖6D位姿作为监督信号，未能显式捕捉位姿的内在连续性，导致预测不一致和对未见位姿的泛化能力下降。

Method: 提出HRC-Pose框架，将物体位姿解耦为旋转和平移分量分别编码；引入基于6D位感知层次排序方案的对比学习策略；设计分别处理旋转感知和平移感知嵌入的位姿估计模块。

Result: 实验证明HRC-Pose成功学习了连续特征空间，在REAL275和CAMERA25基准测试中一致优于现有深度学习方法，并能实时运行。

Conclusion: HRC-Pose通过对比学习有效解决了位姿连续性问题，在类别级物体位姿估计任务中表现出色，具有实际应用的潜力。

Abstract: Category-level object pose estimation aims to predict the 6D pose and 3D size
of objects within given categories. Existing approaches for this task rely
solely on 6D poses as supervisory signals without explicitly capturing the
intrinsic continuity of poses, leading to inconsistencies in predictions and
reduced generalization to unseen poses. To address this limitation, we propose
HRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose
estimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud
representations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples
object pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately
encoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a
contrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on
our 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds
from multiple categories by considering rotational and translational
differences as well as categorical information. We further design pose
estimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and
translation-aware embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate that HRC-Pose
successfully learns continuous feature spaces. Results on REAL275 and CAMERA25
benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms existing depth-only
state-of-the-art methods and runs in real-time, demonstrating its effectiveness
and potential for real-world applications. Our code is at

Motivation: 解决情感可控说话人脸生成中的两个关键挑战：如何有效建模与特定情感相关的多模态关系，以及如何利用这种关系合成保持身份特征的情感视频

Method: 采用两种预训练策略将音频解耦为独立分量并将视频量化为视觉标记组合，提出情感锚点表示将情感信息融入视觉标记，使用自回归变换器建模视觉标记的全局分布并预测索引序列

Result: 在MEAD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估上都表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效实现情感可控的说话人脸生成，为多模态情感视频合成提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at
synthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill
emotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome
two challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship
related to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this
relationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,
we propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face
generation task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies
to disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into
combinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)
representation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.
Finally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global
distribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further
predict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct
experiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned
on multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多目标跟踪系统主要针对行人跟踪，对其他物体类别的泛化能力有限，需要开发能够处理多种物体类型的通用跟踪框架。

Method: 方法包含两个关键组件：(1)遮挡感知重识别机制，增强对被严重遮挡物体的身份保持；(2)道路结构感知轨迹优化策略，利用车道方向、人行横道、道路边界等语义场景先验来改善轨迹连续性和准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于通用的多类跟踪，在传统基准测试中也表现出色，证明了其在通用目标跟踪中的有效性。

Abstract: Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed
for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other
object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable
of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle
tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key
components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances
identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a
road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene
priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve
trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark
dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking
annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused
tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and
several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose
object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class
tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with
HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets. Code and Benchmark

Conclusion: TCFNet通过结合Transformer的全局建模能力和LIA-Net的局部几何结构建模，实现了精确高效的面部骨骼点云变换，为正颌手术规划提供了有效的计算机辅助模拟解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic
surgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations
is significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by
their computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing
strategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods
have been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation
between skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot
process large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy
points, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on
registration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread
applicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based
coarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated
correspondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud
transformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network
and a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second
stages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point
movement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood
precision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric
structures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous
global features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated
recurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose
an auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical
organs.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered
datasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization
results. The code is available at https://github.com/Runshi-Zhang/TCFNet.

Motivation: 解决现有INR方法中复杂激活函数带来的硬件开销问题，在保持性能的同时实现硬件效率优化

Method: 采用分段二次激活函数，利用其傅里叶级数中的丰富谐波内容增强高频信号表达能力，并通过NTK分析验证，开发了统一的N级流水线框架

Result: 在FPGA和ASIC实现中，QuadINR相比现有方法PSNR提升达2.06dB，面积仅1914μm²，动态功耗6.14mW，资源消耗降低97%，功耗降低97%，延迟改善93%

Conclusion: QuadINR通过硬件友好的分段二次激活函数设计，在保持甚至提升INR性能的同时，大幅降低了硬件实现成本和功耗，为高效INR硬件实现提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals continuously
while addressing spectral bias through activation functions (AFs). Previous
approaches mitigate this bias by employing complex AFs, which often incur
significant hardware overhead. To tackle this challenge, we introduce QuadINR,
a hardware-efficient INR that utilizes piecewise quadratic AFs to achieve
superior performance with dramatic reductions in hardware consumption. The
quadratic functions encompass rich harmonic content in their Fourier series,
delivering enhanced expressivity for high-frequency signals, as verified
through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis. We develop a unified $N$-stage
pipeline framework that facilitates efficient hardware implementation of
various AFs in INRs. We demonstrate FPGA implementations on the VCU128 platform
and an ASIC implementation in a 28nm process. Experiments across images and
videos show that QuadINR achieves up to 2.06dB PSNR improvement over prior
work, with an area of only 1914$\mu$m$^2$ and a dynamic power of 6.14mW,
reducing resource and power consumption by up to 97\% and improving latency by

Conclusion: 该方法有效地结合了离散姿态码和连续运动特征，在保持可控性的同时显著提升了运动生成的质量和细节表达。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-motion has advanced both 3D human motion
generation and text-based motion control. Controllable motion generation
(CoMo), which enables intuitive control, typically relies on pose code
representations, but discrete pose codes alone cannot capture fine-grained
motion details, limiting expressiveness. To overcome this, we propose a method
that augments pose code-based latent representations with continuous motion
features using residual vector quantization (RVQ). This design preserves the
interpretability and manipulability of pose codes while effectively capturing
subtle motion characteristics such as high-frequency details. Experiments on
the HumanML3D dataset show that our model reduces Frechet inception distance
(FID) from 0.041 to 0.015 and improves Top-1 R-Precision from 0.508 to 0.510.
Qualitative analysis of pairwise direction similarity between pose codes
further confirms the model's controllability for motion editing.

Conclusion: Img2ST-Net为大规模高效准确的空间转录组学推断提供了原则性解决方案，为下一代鲁棒且分辨率感知的ST建模奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal AI have demonstrated promising potential for
generating the currently expensive spatial transcriptomics (ST) data directly
from routine histology images, offering a means to reduce the high cost and
time-intensive nature of ST data acquisition. However, the increasing
resolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um
or finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.
Conventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient
and unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low
expression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and
evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel
histology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution
ST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net
employs a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene
expression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel
representations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a
super-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output
channels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also
better preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To
enhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce
SSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for
high-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent
framework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled
solution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions
lay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and
resolution-aware. The source code has been made publicly available at

Result: PnP方法比传统同象变换方法抛影误差明显更低，YOLOX-X模型在IoU阈值0.5时达到0.80的mAP。创建了包含3753张图像的BONK-pose公开数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法能够自动创建高质量的6D姿势估计数据集，无需手动标注，为海上船舶监控和安全提供了可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique for creating a 6D pose estimation
dataset for marine vessels by fusing monocular RGB images with Automatic
Identification System (AIS) data. The proposed technique addresses the
limitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues
like equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By
combining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object
detection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D
bounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and
rotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to
locate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods
(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image
coordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to
homography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold
of 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows
the creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.
Additionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a
publicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box
annotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach. This
dataset can be used for training and evaluating 6D pose estimation networks. In
addition we introduce a set of 1000 images with 2D bounding box annotations for
ship detection from the same scene.

TL;DR: CTA-Flux是一个适配器方法，将中文文本输入适配到英文训练的Flux文本生成图像模型，通过MMDiT架构直接控制Flux主干，显著减少参数量的同时提升中文语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Flux等英文训练的文本生成图像模型在处理非英文提示词时表现不佳，特别是由于训练数据集的英文中心化导致的语言和文化偏见。现有方法如翻译或双语微调无法充分处理文化特定语义，影响图像真实性和质量。

Method: 采用MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT)架构直接控制Flux主干模型，而不是使用类似ControlNet的大参数量架构。这种方法显著减少参数数量，同时增强对中文语义的理解。

Result: CTA-Flux支持中英文提示词，在图像生成质量、视觉真实性和中文语义忠实度方面表现优异，同时保持与现有文本生成图像插件（如LoRA、IP-Adapter、ControlNet）的兼容性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了英文中心化TTI模型的中文适配问题，在不大量重新训练整个模型的情况下显著提升了生成质量和文化真实性，为多语言文本生成图像提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We proposed the Chinese Text Adapter-Flux (CTA-Flux). An adaptation method
fits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative
model initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image
generation ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly
when processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and
cultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.
Existing approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or
finetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally
specific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address
this issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic
understanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.
Existing approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require
a massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In
comparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to
control the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of
parameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This
integration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural
authenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining
compatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and
ControlNet. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CTA-flux supports Chinese
and English prompts and achieves superior image generation quality, visual
realism, and faithful depiction of Chinese semantics.

Abstract: The rapid progress in AI and Robotics may lead to a profound societal
transformation, as humans and robots begin to coexist within shared
communities, introducing both opportunities and challenges. To explore this
future, we present Virtual Community-an open-world platform for humans, robots,
and society-built on a universal physics engine and grounded in real-world 3D
scenes. With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at
scale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans
develop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how
intelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,
Virtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator
that supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A
large-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast
outdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with
rich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two
novel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent
reasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to
help agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The
Community Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate
in solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these
tasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task
planning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community
will unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的去摩尔纹方法在处理空间变化强度、大尺度结构、通道依赖统计和时序波动等方面存在局限，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用解耦摩尔纹自适应去摩尔纹(DMAD)和时空自适应去摩尔纹(STAD)两个核心组件，包含摩尔纹解耦块、细节解耦块、空间融合块和特征通道注意力机制。

Result: 在RAW和sRGB两个视频数据集上的评估显示，MoCHA-former在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MoCHA-former通过创新的架构设计有效解决了摩尔纹去除的多个挑战，为相机屏幕拍摄提供了高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture
ubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter
array (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\'e patterns that severely
degrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\'eing models have
been proposed to remove such moir\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer
from several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a
frame, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)
channel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across
frames. We address these issues with the Moir\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive
Transformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled
Moir\'e Adaptive Demoir\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\'eing
(STAD). DMAD separates moir\'e and content via a Moir\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)
and a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\'e-adaptive features
using a Moir\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD
introduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture
large-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel
dependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs
implicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze
moir\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and
evaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former
consistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.

Motivation: 解决单目3D人体姿态估计中的深度模糊、遮挡问题，以及传统方法忽视多尺度骨架特征导致精度下降的挑战。

Method: 提出HyperDiff方法，集成扩散模型和HyperGCN。扩散模型捕捉数据不确定性，HyperGCN作为去噪器使用多粒度结构建模关节间的高阶相关性。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-INF-3DHP数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能，能够灵活适应不同计算资源平衡性能与效率。

Conclusion: HyperDiff通过结合扩散模型和超图卷积网络，有效解决了3D姿态估计中的关键挑战，实现了优异的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) often encounters challenges such as
depth ambiguity and occlusion during the 2D-to-3D lifting process.
Additionally, traditional methods may overlook multi-scale skeleton features
when utilizing skeleton structure information, which can negatively impact the
accuracy of pose estimation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
a novel 3D pose estimation method, HyperDiff, which integrates diffusion models
with HyperGCN. The diffusion model effectively captures data uncertainty,
alleviating depth ambiguity and occlusion. Meanwhile, HyperGCN, serving as a
denoiser, employs multi-granularity structures to accurately model high-order
correlations between joints. This improves the model's denoising capability
especially for complex poses. Experimental results demonstrate that HyperDiff
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP
datasets and can flexibly adapt to varying computational resources to balance
performance and efficiency.

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种基于频率调节的扩散驱动输入适应方法，通过在去噪过程中保留任务相关的语义信息来解决测试时适应中的知识遗忘问题。


<details>

Motivation: 测试时适应方法在平衡领域迁移适应和任务相关知识保留方面存在挑战，适应领域迁移可能导致任务相关知识的遗忘。

Method: 提出FOCUS方法，使用训练好的轻量级Y形频率预测网络(Y-FPN)从噪声图像中分离高低频信息，结合FrequencyMix数据增强方法，在扩散驱动框架中实现频率条件调节。

Result: 在15种损坏类型和三个数据集上的语义分割和单目深度估计任务中达到最先进的平均性能，并能通过FOCUS去噪图像生成伪标签来补充现有模型适应方法。

Conclusion: FOCUS有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题，即使在有限的间歇性监督下也能提升现有模型适应方法的性能，展示了频率条件调节在测试时适应中的有效性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation enables models to adapt to evolving domains. However,
balancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain
shifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to
domain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this
problem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within
a diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially
adaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during
diffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for
dense prediction.
  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network
(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.
This minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in
a diffusion-driven framework. We train Y-FPN with FrequencyMix, a novel data
augmentation method that perturbs the images across diverse frequency bands,
which improves the robustness of our approach to diverse corruptions.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of FOCUS for semantic segmentation and
monocular depth estimation across 15 corruption types and three datasets,
achieving state-of-the-art averaged performance. In addition to improving
standalone performance, FOCUS complements existing model adaptation methods
since we can derive pseudo labels from FOCUS-denoised images for additional
supervision. Even under limited, intermittent supervision with the pseudo
labels derived from the FOCUS denoised images, we show that FOCUS mitigates
catastrophic forgetting for recent model adaptation methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在生成高质量图像方面表现出色，但在多主体组合合成中难以同时实现精确的空间控制和参考主体的忠实重建。

Method: 提出拼接交叉注意力（CCA）机制，将布局规范与文本指导无缝集成；采用渐进式两阶段训练策略，将任务分解为可学习的子目标。

Result: MUSE实现了零样本端到端生成，在空间准确性和身份一致性方面优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: MUSE框架推进了可控图像合成的前沿，能够同时满足空间精度和身份保持的双重要求。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.
However, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial
control remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of
layout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful
reconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified
regions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately
improved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to
simultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity
preservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a
unified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to
seamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through
explicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables
bidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual
descriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive
two-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable
sub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial
accuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the
frontier of controllable image synthesis. Our code and model are available at

Conclusion: 多模态数据融合和NIR信息的加入显著提升了农业场景3D重建的鲁棒性和植物学洞察力

Abstract: While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in
agriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique
challenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven
illumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these
limitations, we introduce \textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset
encompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,
and LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.
By integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial
botanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we
leverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,
NDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual
understanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these
modalities, we propose \textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian
splatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D
point-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that \textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms
existing landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat,
highlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios. The code

Abstract: Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer
interaction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability
across diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction
dynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel
Attention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement
modeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable
domain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the
data's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving
generalizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,
the framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that
explicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)
states between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA
establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and
cross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45
in Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the
NoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning
the first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3D说话头合成中的数据依赖问题，通过解耦策略和优化模块显著提升了合成质量和同步精度

Abstract: A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a
long-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity
from scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting
general features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio
contains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically
struggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face
when trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking
head image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that
constructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial
Motion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute
deformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and
personalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss
function during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,
we integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating
blurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization
with limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.

Abstract: While multi-step diffusion models have advanced both forward and inverse
rendering, existing approaches often treat these problems independently,
leading to cycle inconsistency and slow inference speed. In this work, we
present Ouroboros, a framework composed of two single-step diffusion models
that handle forward and inverse rendering with mutual reinforcement. Our
approach extends intrinsic decomposition to both indoor and outdoor scenes and
introduces a cycle consistency mechanism that ensures coherence between forward

state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenes while achieving
substantially faster inference speed compared to other diffusion-based methods.
We also demonstrate that Ouroboros can transfer to video decomposition in a
training-free manner, reducing temporal inconsistency in video sequences while
maintaining high-quality per-frame inverse rendering.

Conclusion: DreamSwapV提供了一个有效的视频主体替换解决方案，能够实现高质量、保真度高的任意主体替换，为定制化视频编辑提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of video generation, demand for customized video
editing is surging, where subject swapping constitutes a key component yet
remains under-explored. Prevailing swapping approaches either specialize in
narrow domains--such as human-body animation or hand-object interaction--or
rely on some indirect editing paradigm or ambiguous text prompts that
compromise final fidelity. In this paper, we propose DreamSwapV, a mask-guided,
subject-agnostic, end-to-end framework that swaps any subject in any video for
customization with a user-specified mask and reference image. To inject
fine-grained guidance, we introduce multiple conditions and a dedicated
condition fusion module that integrates them efficiently. In addition, an
adaptive mask strategy is designed to accommodate subjects of varying scales
and attributes, further improving interactions between the swapped subject and
its surrounding context. Through our elaborate two-phase dataset construction
and training scheme, our DreamSwapV outperforms existing methods, as validated
by comprehensive experiments on VBench indicators and our first introduced
DreamSwapV-Benchmark.

Conclusion: 该工作为解决第一人称视角6D头部姿态预测问题提供了有效框架和宝贵的数据资源，展示了在真实世界导航策略学习方面的潜力

Abstract: The ability to predict collision-free future trajectories from egocentric
observations is crucial in applications such as humanoid robotics, VR / AR, and
assistive navigation. In this work, we introduce the challenging problem of
predicting a sequence of future 6D head poses from an egocentric video. In
particular, we predict both head translations and rotations to learn the active
information-gathering behavior expressed through head-turning events. To solve
this task, we propose a framework that reasons over temporally aggregated 3D
latent features, which models the geometric and semantic constraints for both
the static and dynamic parts of the environment. Motivated by the lack of
training data in this space, we further contribute a data collection pipeline
using the Project Aria glasses, and present a dataset collected through this
approach. Our dataset, dubbed Aria Navigation Dataset (AND), consists of 4
hours of recording of users navigating in real-world scenarios. It includes
diverse situations and navigation behaviors, providing a valuable resource for
learning real-world egocentric navigation policies. Extensive experiments show
that our model learns human-like navigation behaviors such as waiting / slowing
down, rerouting, and looking around for traffic while generalizing to unseen

Method: 提出概念蒸馏训练策略，利用预训练T2V模型合成训练样本；重新设计控制架构，包括控制特征投影器和双分支ControlNet连接器，结合MLP特征映射和交叉注意力机制。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试以及AIGC视频上表现优于现有方法，实现了出色的纹理真实性、视觉生动性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: Vivid-VR通过创新的训练策略和架构设计，有效解决了视频修复中的纹理和时间一致性问题，为生成式视频恢复提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Vivid-VR, a DiT-based generative video restoration method built
upon an advanced T2V foundation model, where ControlNet is leveraged to control
the generation process, ensuring content consistency. However, conventional
fine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution
drift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in
compromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,
we propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the
pretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual
concepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture
and temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the
control architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector
that filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their
propagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector
employing a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines
MLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control
feature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control
signal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably
against existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as
well as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,
and temporal consistency. The codes and checkpoints are publicly available at

Abstract: Weed management represents a critical challenge in agriculture, significantly
impacting crop yields and requiring substantial resources for control.
Effective weed monitoring and analysis strategies are crucial for implementing
sustainable agricultural practices and site-specific management approaches. We
introduce WeedSense, a novel multi-task learning architecture for comprehensive
weed analysis that jointly performs semantic segmentation, height estimation,
and growth stage classification. We present a unique dataset capturing 16 weed
species over an 11-week growth cycle with pixel-level annotations, height
measurements, and temporal labels. WeedSense leverages a dual-path encoder

*Thanh-Nhan Vo,Trong-Thuan Nguyen,Tam V. Nguyen,Minh-Triet Tran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SATURN是一种轻量级扩展方法，通过将场景图转换为显著性排序的token序列，让冻结的CLIP-VQ-VAE主干网络能够理解图结构，只需微调VAR变换器，在保持最先进自回归保真度的同时有效捕捉复杂提示中的布局和对象关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在照片级渲染方面表现出色，但在捕捉复杂提示所暗示的布局和对象关系方面存在困难。场景图提供了自然的结构先验，但以往的图引导方法通常依赖繁重的GAN或扩散管道，在速度和保真度上都落后于现代自回归架构。

Method: 引入SATURN（结构化三元组统一渲染网络），这是VAR-CLIP的轻量级扩展，将场景图转换为显著性排序的token序列，使冻结的CLIP-VQ-VAE主干能够解释图结构，同时仅微调VAR变换器。

Result: 在Visual Genome数据集上，SATURN将FID从56.45%降低到21.62%，将Inception Score从16.03提高到24.78，优于SG2IM和SGDiff等先前方法，且不需要额外模块或多阶段训练。定性结果进一步证实了在对象计数保真度和空间关系准确性方面的改进。

Conclusion: SATURN有效地将结构意识与最先进的自回归保真度相结合，展示了在保持高性能的同时处理复杂场景结构的能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models excel at photorealistic rendering but
often struggle to capture the layout and object relationships implied by
complex prompts. Scene graphs provide a natural structural prior, yet previous
graph-guided approaches have typically relied on heavy GAN or diffusion
pipelines, which lag behind modern autoregressive architectures in both speed
and fidelity. We introduce SATURN (Structured Arrangement of Triplets for
Unified Rendering Networks), a lightweight extension to VAR-CLIP that
translates a scene graph into a salience-ordered token sequence, enabling a
frozen CLIP-VQ-VAE backbone to interpret graph structure while fine-tuning only
the VAR transformer. On the Visual Genome dataset, SATURN reduces FID from
56.45% to 21.62% and increases the Inception Score from 16.03 to 24.78,
outperforming prior methods such as SG2IM and SGDiff without requiring extra
modules or multi-stage training. Qualitative results further confirm
improvements in object count fidelity and spatial relation accuracy, showing
that SATURN effectively combines structural awareness with state-of-the-art
autoregressive fidelity.

TL;DR: PB-IAD是一个基于提示工程的工业异常检测框架，利用基础模型的多模态和推理能力，在数据稀疏场景下表现出色，无需大量标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计和数据驱动方法在工业异常检测中依赖大量标注数据且缺乏灵活性，基础模型的感知能力为此任务提供了新机遇。

Method: 提出PB-IAD框架，包含专门设计的提示模板和预处理模块，利用GPT-4.1的多模态能力，通过语义指令实现异常检测。

Result: 在三种制造场景和两种数据模态下评估，PB-IAD在数据稀疏和低样本设置下表现优异，优于PatchCore等先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过语义指令实现了卓越性能，特别适合动态生产环境，允许领域专家灵活定制而无需数据科学专业知识。

Abstract: The detection of anomalies in manufacturing processes is crucial to ensure
product quality and identify process deviations. Statistical and data-driven
approaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their
adaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive
annotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.
Recent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide
promising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This
paper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel
framework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of
foundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD
addresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data
sparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the
anomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is
specifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process
knowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user
inputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain
experts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science
expertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across
three distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation
study to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.
Furthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly
detection such as PatchCore. The results demonstrate superior performance,
particularly in data-sparse scenarios and low-shot settings, achieved solely
through semantic instructions.

<details>

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶安全评估主要依赖预定义的威胁模式或基于规则的策略，无法暴露多样化和不可预见的故障模式，需要更有效的场景生成方法

Method: 首先进行元场景生成，使用基于结构化驾驶知识的大语言模型推断具有威胁性的对抗智能体行为；然后通过复杂场景演化使用背景车辆放大核心威胁，构建对抗协作图来优化关键轨迹

Result: 在多个基于强化学习的AV模型上进行的实验显示，ScenGE平均比最先进基线多发现31.96%的严重碰撞案例，生成的场景既合理又关键，且能提高模型鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该框架为建立公众信任和确保自动驾驶安全部署迈出了关键一步，能够生成大量安全关键场景，验证了生成场景的合理性和关键性

Abstract: The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become
increasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road
deployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined
threat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose
diverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a
framework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning
novel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.
Given a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario
Generation, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving
knowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is
both plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then
specified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,
Complex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat
introduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to
identify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are
designed to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and
create critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
reinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe
collision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our
ScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different
simulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios
improves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through
real-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated
scenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a
critical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WISE-FUSE是一个自适应全切片图像编码框架，通过选择性处理诊断相关区域，将WSI编码时间减少三倍以上，同时保持或超越详尽补丁处理的诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全切片图像（WSI）由于千兆像素规模，需要处理数万到数十万个高分辨率补丁，导致编码成本过高，预处理和训练时间长达数天甚至数周，成为实际部署中的主要瓶颈。

Method: WISE-FUSE利用病理领域视觉语言模型和大语言模型，首先计算低分辨率补丁与类别特定文本描述之间的相似性分数，基于这些分数选择信息丰富的区域子集，然后选择性编码对应的高分辨率补丁并与文本嵌入融合以增强诊断上下文。

Result: 广泛实验表明，WISE-FUSE将WSI编码时间减少了三倍以上，同时实现了与详尽补丁处理相当或更好的诊断性能。

Conclusion: WISE-FUSE为计算病理学提供了一个可扩展且实用的解决方案，有效解决了WSI编码瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) in computational pathology (CPath) pose a major
computational challenge due to their gigapixel scale, often requiring the
processing of tens to hundreds of thousands of high-resolution patches per
slide. This results in prohibitive encoding costs, with preprocessing and
training times extending to days or even weeks-making WSI encoding the most
significant bottleneck in real-world deployment. In this work, we propose
WISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain
vision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by
selectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first
computes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific
textual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves
fine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a
small subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly
eliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding
high-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual
embeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving
diagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch
processing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.

<details>

Motivation: 当前OCR系统在处理低质量文档时表现不佳，特别是印刷文档的域间变异性高而域内变异性低，未能充分利用文档内部的字符形状冗余信息

Method: 扩展高斯混合模型(GMM)，交替使用期望最大化(EM)算法和簇内重新对齐过程，结合正态性统计测试来优化字符聚类

Result: 在多种退化程度的文档上验证有效，包括乌拉圭军事档案和17-20世纪欧洲报纸，展示了识别精度的提升

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用文档内部冗余信息来纠正OCR错误，为处理历史文档和低质量印刷材料提供了有效的无监督解决方案

Abstract: Current OCR systems are based on deep learning models trained on large
amounts of data. Although they have shown some ability to generalize to unseen
data, especially in detection tasks, they can struggle with recognizing
low-quality data. This is particularly evident for printed documents, where
intra-domain data variability is typically low, but inter-domain data
variability is high. In that context, current OCR methods do not fully exploit
each document's redundancy. We propose an unsupervised method by leveraging the
redundancy of character shapes within a document to correct imperfect outputs
of a given OCR system and suggest better clustering. To this aim, we introduce
an extended Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) by alternating an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with an intra-cluster realignment
process and normality statistical testing. We demonstrate improvements in
documents with various levels of degradation, including recovered Uruguayan
military archives and 17th to mid-20th century European newspapers.

Abstract: Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of
high spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve
cost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an
automated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level
of each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel
and Boundary Delineation (APBD). This review covers APBD methods for detecting
and delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and
present of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the
goal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a
comprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis,
including the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the
evaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1)
traditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and
region-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest,
decision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep
learning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss
deep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object
detection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five
APBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing
data, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task
learning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among
different algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review
proposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and
potential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help
researchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and
tendency.

TL;DR: LCBM是一种基于原型学习的局部感知概念瓶颈模型，通过利用基础模型的丰富信息来确保概念的空间准确定位，解决了无标签CBM在概念定位上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型需要密集的人工概念标注，成本高昂。虽然近期使用基础模型来自动确定概念，但这些无标签CBM往往无法准确定位概念的相关区域，会关注视觉上不相关的区域。

Method: 提出LCBM框架，为每个概念分配一个原型，通过原型学习确保概念的空间准确定位。利用基础模型确保原型与相关概念的相关性，并使用原型促进学习过程以识别每个概念应该从哪个局部区域预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，LCBM能有效识别图像中存在的概念，在保持可比分类性能的同时，展现出改进的定位能力。

Conclusion: LCBM通过原型学习和基础模型的结合，成功解决了无标签概念瓶颈模型的概念定位问题，实现了更好的空间定位精度。

Abstract: Concept bottleneck models (CBMs) are inherently interpretable models that
make predictions based on human-understandable visual cues, referred to as
concepts. As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is
demanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine
the concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail
to localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated
regions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,
coined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich
information from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure
accurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one
prototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature
of that concept. These prototypes are learned by encouraging them to encode
similar local regions, leveraging foundation models to assure the relevance of
each prototype to its associated concept. Then we use the prototypes to
facilitate the learning process of identifying the proper local region from
which each concept should be predicted. Experimental results demonstrate that
LCBM effectively identifies present concepts in the images and exhibits
improved localization while maintaining comparable classification performance.

Conclusion: GOGS框架有效解决了光泽物体逆向渲染中的镜面反射问题，通过创新的两阶段方法和先进的光线追踪技术，实现了高质量的几何重建和逼真的重光照效果

Abstract: Inverse rendering of glossy objects from RGB imagery remains fundamentally
limited by inherent ambiguity. Although NeRF-based methods achieve
high-fidelity reconstruction via dense-ray sampling, their computational cost
is prohibitive. Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting achieves high reconstruction
efficiency but exhibits limitations under specular reflections. Multi-view
inconsistencies introduce high-frequency surface noise and structural
artifacts, while simplified rendering equations obscure material properties,
leading to implausible relighting results. To address these issues, we propose
GOGS, a novel two-stage framework based on 2D Gaussian surfels. First, we
establish robust surface reconstruction through physics-based rendering with
split-sum approximation, enhanced by geometric priors from foundation models.
Second, we perform material decomposition by leveraging Monte Carlo importance
sampling of the full rendering equation, modeling indirect illumination via
differentiable 2D Gaussian ray tracing and refining high-frequency specular
details through spherical mipmap-based directional encoding that captures
anisotropic highlights. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance in geometry reconstruction, material separation, and photorealistic
relighting under novel illuminations, outperforming existing inverse rendering
approaches.

Motivation: 数字病理学中的全切片图像分析面临两个主要挑战：千兆像素分辨率带来的计算负担和密集监督信号的稀缺性。传统补丁级增强成本过高，而现有特征级增强方法缺乏对变换语义的控制

Method: 提出HistAug生成模型，通过在潜在空间中条件化明确的补丁级变换（如色调、侵蚀等）来生成真实的增强嵌入，同时保留初始语义信息。该方法能够高效地单次前向处理大量补丁

Result: 在多个切片级任务和不同器官上的实验表明，HistAug优于现有方法，特别是在低数据情况下。消融研究证实了学习变换相对于基于噪声的扰动的优势，并强调了统一WSI级增强的重要性

Conclusion: HistAug提供了一种快速高效的解决方案，能够显著提升MIL模型性能，特别是在数据稀缺的情况下，为数字病理学中的WSI分析提供了有效的增强方法

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis in digital pathology presents unique
challenges due to the gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of dense
supervision signals. While Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a natural fit
for slide-level tasks, training robust models requires large and diverse
datasets. Even though image augmentation techniques could be utilized to
increase data variability and reduce overfitting, implementing them effectively
is not a trivial task. Traditional patch-level augmentation is prohibitively
expensive due to the large number of patches extracted from each WSI, and
existing feature-level augmentation methods lack control over transformation
semantics. We introduce HistAug, a fast and efficient generative model for
controllable augmentations in the latent space for digital pathology. By
conditioning on explicit patch-level transformations (e.g., hue, erosion),
HistAug generates realistic augmented embeddings while preserving initial
semantic information. Our method allows the processing of a large number of
patches in a single forward pass efficiently, while at the same time
consistently improving MIL model performance. Experiments across multiple
slide-level tasks and diverse organs show that HistAug outperforms existing
methods, particularly in low-data regimes. Ablation studies confirm the
benefits of learned transformations over noise-based perturbations and
highlight the importance of uniform WSI-wise augmentation. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架为监控、工业安全和自主监测应用中的早期火灾检测提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,
necessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion
precursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal
dynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and
environmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To
address these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor
arrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature
representations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase
Uncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke
detection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via
optical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is
performed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set
fractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The
resulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a
Gaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke
regions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows
Transformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head
and trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes
smoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to
estimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple
evaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches
demonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable
solution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and
autonomous monitoring applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉提示方法在增量图像分类中表现出色，但其在增量目标检测中的通用性尚未得到验证，需要探索这些方法在更复杂场景下的表现。

Method: 在复杂域增量学习设置下分析三种不同的提示方法，提供广泛的基线比较，并测试提示长度和初始化策略的影响。

Result: 测试的提示方法在IOD设置下表现不佳，但结合少量数据回放的视觉提示方法取得了最佳结果。

Conclusion: 研究为推进提示方法在增量目标检测中的应用提供了有价值的见解，表明需要结合数据回放策略来获得更好的性能。

Abstract: Visual prompt-based methods have seen growing interest in incremental
learning (IL) for image classification. These approaches learn additional
embedding vectors while keeping the model frozen, making them efficient to
train. However, no prior work has applied such methods to incremental object
detection (IOD), leaving their generalizability unclear. In this paper, we
analyze three different prompt-based methods under a complex domain-incremental
learning setting. We additionally provide a wide range of reference baselines
for comparison. Empirically, we show that the prompt-based approaches we tested
underperform in this setting. However, a strong yet practical method, combining
visual prompts with replaying a small portion of previous data, achieves the
best results. Together with additional experiments on prompt length and
initialization, our findings offer valuable insights for advancing prompt-based
IL in IOD.

TL;DR: 提出了UST-SSM模型，通过时空选择扫描、时空结构聚合和时间交互采样技术，解决了点云视频时空无序问题，在多个数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云视频能捕捉动态3D运动且减少光照和视角变化的影响，但现有的选择性状态空间模型在处理点云视频时，由于时空无序性导致单向建模效果受限。

Method: 提出统一时空状态空间模型(UST-SSM)，包含：1)时空选择扫描(STSS)通过提示引导聚类重组无序点；2)时空结构聚合(STSA)聚合时空特征并补偿缺失细节；3)时间交互采样(TIS)增强时间依赖性和感受野。

Result: 在MSR-Action3D、NTU RGB+D和Synthia 4D数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: UST-SSM成功将SSM最新进展扩展到点云视频处理，通过创新的时空重组和特征补偿机制，有效解决了点云视频的时空无序挑战。

Abstract: Point cloud videos capture dynamic 3D motion while reducing the effects of
lighting and viewpoint variations, making them highly effective for recognizing
subtle and continuous human actions. Although Selective State Space Models
(SSMs) have shown good performance in sequence modeling with linear complexity,
the spatio-temporal disorder of point cloud videos hinders their unidirectional
modeling when directly unfolding the point cloud video into a 1D sequence
through temporally sequential scanning. To address this challenge, we propose
the Unified Spatio-Temporal State Space Model (UST-SSM), which extends the
latest advancements in SSMs to point cloud videos. Specifically, we introduce
Spatial-Temporal Selection Scanning (STSS), which reorganizes unordered points
into semantic-aware sequences through prompt-guided clustering, thereby
enabling the effective utilization of points that are spatially and temporally
distant yet similar within the sequence. For missing 4D geometric and motion
details, Spatio-Temporal Structure Aggregation (STSA) aggregates
spatio-temporal features and compensates. To improve temporal interaction
within the sampled sequence, Temporal Interaction Sampling (TIS) enhances
fine-grained temporal dependencies through non-anchor frame utilization and
expanded receptive fields. Experimental results on the MSR-Action3D, NTU RGB+D,
and Synthia 4D datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is
available at https://github.com/wangzy01/UST-SSM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SMTrack是首个直接在标准RGB视频上进行端到端多目标跟踪的深度脉冲神经网络框架，通过自适应尺度感知的归一化Wasserstein距离损失和TrackTrack身份模块，在复杂场景中实现了与领先ANN方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络(SNN)在低功耗计算方面具有巨大潜力，但在视觉任务中的应用主要局限于图像分类、目标检测和事件跟踪。对于广泛使用的传统RGB视频流，SNN在复杂时序任务如多目标跟踪方面的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出SMTrack框架，引入自适应尺度感知归一化Wasserstein距离损失(Asa-NWDLoss)来改善不同尺度和密度下的检测定位性能。该方法计算每个训练批次内的平均目标尺寸并动态调整归一化因子，增强对小目标的敏感性。在关联阶段采用TrackTrack身份模块来保持鲁棒和一致的目标轨迹。

Result: 在BEE24、MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的广泛评估表明，SMTrack实现了与领先ANN基MOT方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: SMTrack推动了SNN基跟踪在复杂场景中的鲁棒性和准确性，为脉冲神经网络在实时视频处理任务中的应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential
for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains
largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based
tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional
RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex
temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To
address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN
framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack
introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss
(Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying
object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average
object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the
normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the
association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain
robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24,
MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with
leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking
in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: AnchorSync通过创新的解耦框架有效解决了长视频编辑的关键挑战，为高质量长视频编辑提供了可行方案

Abstract: Editing long videos remains a challenging task due to the need for
maintaining both global consistency and temporal coherence across thousands of
frames. Existing methods often suffer from structural drift or temporal
artifacts, particularly in minute-long sequences. We introduce AnchorSync, a
novel diffusion-based framework that enables high-quality, long-term video
editing by decoupling the task into sparse anchor frame editing and smooth
intermediate frame interpolation. Our approach enforces structural consistency
through a progressive denoising process and preserves temporal dynamics via
multimodal guidance. Extensive experiments show that AnchorSync produces
coherent, high-fidelity edits, surpassing prior methods in visual quality and
temporal stability.

Conclusion: PerSense框架为密集图像中的个性化实例分割提供了有效的解决方案，PerSense++通过额外的增强组件进一步提升了在杂乱场景中的性能，并为此任务建立了专用基准数据集PerSense-D。

Abstract: Segmentation in dense visual scenes poses significant challenges due to
occlusions, background clutter, and scale variations. To address this, we
introduce PerSense, an end-to-end, training-free, and model-agnostic one-shot
framework for Personalized instance Segmentation in dense images. PerSense
employs a novel Instance Detection Module (IDM) that leverages density maps
(DMs) to generate instance-level candidate point prompts, followed by a Point
Prompt Selection Module (PPSM) that filters false positives via adaptive
thresholding and spatial gating. A feedback mechanism further enhances
segmentation by automatically selecting effective exemplars to improve DM
quality. We additionally present PerSense++, an enhanced variant that
incorporates three additional components to improve robustness in cluttered
scenes: (i) a diversity-aware exemplar selection strategy that leverages
feature and scale diversity for better DM generation; (ii) a hybrid IDM
combining contour and peak-based prompt generation for improved instance
separation within complex density patterns; and (iii) an Irrelevant Mask
Rejection Module (IMRM) that discards spatially inconsistent masks using
outlier analysis. Finally, to support this underexplored task, we introduce
PerSense-D, a dedicated benchmark for personalized segmentation in dense
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
PerSense++ outperforms existing methods in dense settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeMS是一个处理严重运动模糊图像的3D高斯泼溅框架，无需依赖清晰图像进行相机姿态估计，通过深度学习的SfM、概率分布建模和联合优化实现直接从模糊输入重建场景。GeMS-E版本进一步集成事件相机数据提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要清晰图像进行相机姿态估计和点云生成，这在严重运动模糊场景下不现实。基于COLMAP初始化的方法也因特征对应不可靠而失败，需要直接从极端模糊图像重建3D场景的新方法。

Method: 1) VGGSfM：基于深度学习的SfM管道，直接从模糊输入估计姿态和生成点云；2) 3DGS-MCMC：将高斯视为概率分布样本，消除启发式密集化和修剪；3) 相机轨迹和高斯参数联合优化；4) GeMS-E增加事件双积分去模糊步骤。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实现了最先进的性能，是首个直接从严重模糊输入处理极端运动模糊的3DGS框架。

Conclusion: GeMS框架成功解决了从极端运动模糊图像直接进行3D重建的挑战，通过深度学习SfM和概率建模方法，无需依赖清晰图像，为严重模糊场景的3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GeMS, a framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) designed to
handle severely motion-blurred images. State-of-the-art deblurring methods for
extreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches
like Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose
estimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods
relying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to
unreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these
challenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly
from extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep
learning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and
generates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which
enables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a
probability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and
(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for
stable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,
inaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,
we propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:
(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that
are then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and
overall reconstruction. Both GeMS and GeMS-E achieve state-of-the-art
performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, this is the
first framework to address extreme motion blur within 3DGS directly from
severely blurred inputs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Vision foundation models (VFMs) are predominantly developed using
data-centric methods. These methods require training on vast amounts of data
usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most
institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other
hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific
data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is
transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly
valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the
development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new
model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and
preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a
shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by
their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation
strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating
knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.
By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit
teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.
Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently
supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision
tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在极端新颖视角或部分观测区域渲染质量有限，而扩散模型虽有强大生成能力但缺乏特定场景信息感知，难以进行准确3D重建。

Method: 提出GSFix3D框架，核心是GSFixer潜在扩散模型，通过定制微调协议利用网格和3D高斯来适应不同环境和重建方法，并提出随机掩码增强策略进行缺失区域修复。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，仅需对捕获数据进行最小程度的场景特定微调，真实世界测试证实其对潜在姿态误差的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GSFix3D成功将扩散模型的生成能力与3D表示的场景一致性相结合，为新颖视角合成和3D重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent developments in 3D Gaussian Splatting have significantly enhanced
novel view synthesis, yet generating high-quality renderings from extreme novel
viewpoints or partially observed regions remains challenging. Meanwhile,
diffusion models exhibit strong generative capabilities, but their reliance on
text prompts and lack of awareness of specific scene information hinder
accurate 3D reconstruction tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce
GSFix3D, a novel framework that improves the visual fidelity in
under-constrained regions by distilling prior knowledge from diffusion models
into 3D representations, while preserving consistency with observed scene
details. At its core is GSFixer, a latent diffusion model obtained via our
customized fine-tuning protocol that can leverage both mesh and 3D Gaussians to
adapt pretrained generative models to a variety of environments and artifact
types from different reconstruction methods, enabling robust novel view repair
for unseen camera poses. Moreover, we propose a random mask augmentation
strategy that empowers GSFixer to plausibly inpaint missing regions.
Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our GSFix3D and GSFixer
achieve state-of-the-art performance, requiring only minimal scene-specific
fine-tuning on captured data. Real-world test further confirms its resilience
to potential pose errors. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving is a complex challenge requiring
handling unknown objects and unforeseen driving scenarios. We develop
multiscale video transformers capable of detecting unknown objects using only
motion cues. Video semantic and panoptic segmentation often relies on known
classes seen during training, overlooking novel categories. Recent visual
grounding with large language models is computationally expensive, especially
for pixel-level output. We propose an efficient video transformer trained
end-to-end for class-agnostic segmentation without optical flow. Our method
uses multi-stage multiscale query-memory decoding and a scale-specific random
drop-token to ensure efficiency and accuracy, maintaining detailed
spatiotemporal features with a shared, learnable memory module. Unlike
conventional decoders that compress features, our memory-centric design
preserves high-resolution information at multiple scales. We evaluate on
DAVIS'16, KITTI, and Cityscapes. Our method consistently outperforms multiscale
baselines while being efficient in GPU memory and run-time, demonstrating a
promising direction for real-time, robust dense prediction in safety-critical
robotics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个包含多种光照条件和相机传感器的RAW图像数据集，并开发了一个轻量级神经网络方法，用于光照和传感器映射，在神经ISP训练等下游任务中表现出色。


<details>

Motivation: RAW图像具有传感器和光照特定的特性，这使得为深度学习捕获RAW数据集具有挑战性，因为需要为每个传感器和广泛的光照条件捕获场景。需要开发光照增强和传感器间映射的方法来减轻数据采集负担。

Method: 使用定制化的可调光谱光照箱，在390种光照条件下使用4台不同相机捕获18个场景，构建首个此类数据集。基于此数据集开发了一个轻量级神经网络方法进行光照和传感器映射。

Result: 提出的轻量级神经网络方法在光照和传感器映射任务上优于竞争方法，并在神经ISP训练等下游任务中证明了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决RAW图像数据采集挑战提供了有效解决方案，通过光照和传感器映射技术显著减少了数据采集需求，为基于RAW图像的深度学习应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: RAW images are unprocessed camera sensor output with sensor-specific RGB
values based on the sensor's color filter spectral sensitivities. RAW images
also incur strong color casts due to the sensor's response to the spectral
properties of scene illumination. The sensor- and illumination-specific nature
of RAW images makes it challenging to capture RAW datasets for deep learning
methods, as scenes need to be captured for each sensor and under a wide range
of illumination. Methods for illumination augmentation for a given sensor and
the ability to map RAW images between sensors are important for reducing the
burden of data capture. To explore this problem, we introduce the
first-of-its-kind dataset comprising carefully captured scenes under a wide
range of illumination. Specifically, we use a customized lightbox with tunable
illumination spectra to capture several scenes with different cameras. Our
illumination and sensor mapping dataset has 390 illuminations, four cameras,
and 18 scenes. Using this dataset, we introduce a lightweight neural network
approach for illumination and sensor mapping that outperforms competing
methods. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on the downstream task of
training a neural ISP. Link to project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机在高速运动场景下存在帧率限制和运动模糊问题，而事件相机具有高时间分辨率、低延迟和高动态范围的优势，但缺乏丰富的视觉信息。需要结合两种传感器的优势来解决高速物体6-DoF姿态跟踪的挑战。

Method: 使用基于事件的光流算法测量物体运动，实现6-DoF速度跟踪器。将跟踪到的物体6-DoF速度与低频的全局姿态估计器输出的姿态信息进行融合，从而在高速运动时保持准确的姿态跟踪。

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上都进行了测试验证，证明了该方法的有效性，特别是在高速运动场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过融合事件相机的高速运动测量能力和RGB相机的丰富视觉信息，成功实现了高速物体的6-DoF姿态跟踪，为解决高速运动场景下的姿态估计问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in
real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It
becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate
limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are
characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,
that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB
cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the
challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we
propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object
pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the
core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an
event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement
an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF
velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the
method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm
is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating
its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的对抗框架能有效缓解PFMs中的医院偏差，为临床部署提供了更可靠的解决方案，特别是在跨医院泛化场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
whole-slide image (WSI) diagnosis. However, pathology images from different
hospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing
styles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,
posing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source
characteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying
domain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple
models, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent
hospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the
encoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier
connected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns
task-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on
multi-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach
substantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving
disease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen
hospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature
space visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating
hospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.

Abstract: License plate recognition (LPR) is important for traffic law enforcement,
crime investigation, and surveillance. However, license plate areas in dash cam
images often suffer from low resolution, motion blur, and glare, which make
accurate recognition challenging. Existing generative models that rely on
pretrained priors cannot reliably restore such poor-quality images, frequently
introducing severe artifacts and distortions. To address this issue, we propose
a novel multi-frame license plate restoration and recognition framework,
MF-LPR$^2$, which addresses ambiguities in poor-quality images by aligning and
aggregating neighboring frames instead of relying on pretrained knowledge. To
achieve accurate frame alignment, we employ a state-of-the-art optical flow
estimator in conjunction with carefully designed algorithms that detect and
correct erroneous optical flow estimations by leveraging the spatio-temporal
consistency inherent in license plate image sequences. Our approach enhances
both image quality and recognition accuracy while preserving the evidential
content of the input images. In addition, we constructed a novel Realistic LPR
(RLPR) dataset to evaluate MF-LPR$^2$. The RLPR dataset contains 200 pairs of
low-quality license plate image sequences and high-quality pseudo ground-truth
images, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios. In experiments,
MF-LPR$^2$ outperformed eight recent restoration models in terms of PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS by significant margins. In recognition, MF-LPR$^2$ achieved an
accuracy of 86.44%, outperforming both the best single-frame LPR (14.04%) and
the multi-frame LPR (82.55%) among the eleven baseline models. The results of
ablation studies confirm that our filtering and refinement algorithms
significantly contribute to these improvements.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的医学图像配准方法，使用冻结的DINOv3编码器和测试时特征空间优化，在两个基准测试中取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习方法需要大量训练数据，限制了临床采用。为了克服这一限制，需要开发无需训练数据的配准方法

Method: 使用冻结的DINOv3编码器提取特征，在测试时通过优化特征空间中的变形场来实现图像配准

Result: 在腹部MR-CT上获得最佳Dice分数0.790，最低HD95为4.9±5.0，最低SDLogJ为0.08±0.02；在ACDC心脏MRI上DSC提升至0.769，SDLogJ降至0.11，HD95降至4.8

Conclusion: 在紧凑的基础特征空间中进行测试时优化，为无需额外训练的临床配准提供了实用且通用的解决方案

Abstract: Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based
methods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains
clinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free
pipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of
the deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,
the method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it
attained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard
deviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it
improves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked
gain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a
compact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general
solution for clinical registration without additional training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Tinker是一个无需逐场景微调的高保真3D编辑框架，支持单样本和少样本编辑，通过重新利用预训练扩散模型实现多视角一致性编辑


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术需要大量逐场景优化来保证多视角一致性或生成一致的编辑输入视图，限制了3D编辑的可扩展性和效率

Method: 开发了包含两个核心组件的框架：(1)参考多视角编辑器实现精确的参考驱动编辑；(2)任意视角到视频合成器利用视频扩散的空间-时间先验进行高质量场景补全和新视角生成

Result: 在编辑、新视角合成和渲染增强任务上达到最先进性能，显著降低了通用3D内容创建的门槛

Conclusion: Tinker代表了向真正可扩展、零样本3D编辑的关键一步

Abstract: We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that
operates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene
finetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene
optimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of
consistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent
edits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing
pretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive
research in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing
dataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this
dataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent
edited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel
components: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven
edits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video
synthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform
high-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse
inputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier
to generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
editing, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks. We believe that
Tinker represents a key step towards truly scalable, zero-shot 3D editing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频-文本检索框架，通过细粒度特征学习和推理管道改进，无需额外训练即可提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频流媒体爆炸式增长带来高精度和低训练成本的挑战，现有方法依赖大规模预训练导致计算需求大，且视频文本的细粒度信息未被充分探索

Method: 采用粗到细的目标函数理解视频-文本对的语义信息，包括对比学习和匹配学习；通过粒度感知表示模块获取细粒度训练数据；提出包含投票机制和匹配熵度量的推理管道

Result: 在四个基准测试中优于先前方法，推理管道在MSR-VTT数据集上Recall@1提升2.1%，在DiDeMo数据集上提升1.6%

Conclusion: 该方法通过细粒度特征学习和创新的推理管道有效提升了视频-文本检索性能，且无需额外预训练成本

Abstract: The explosive growth of video streaming presents challenges in achieving high
accuracy and low training costs for video-language retrieval. However, existing
methods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval
performance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the
fine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To
alleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained
features for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve
performance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine
objectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,
including contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for
training is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which
is designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in
captions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the
original captions, referred to as "Repetition", can enhance retrieval
performance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this
insight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates
a voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better
retrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental
results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
previous approaches. Additionally, our inference pipeline achieves significant
performance improvements, with a 2.1% increase in Recall@1 on the MSR-VTT
dataset and a 1.6% increase on the DiDeMo dataset.

TL;DR: TransLight是一个新颖的光照效果迁移框架，通过生成式解耦技术分离图像内容和光照效果，实现高质量、高自由度的光照迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光照编辑方法无法同时提供定制化的光照控制并保持内容完整性，特别是在从参考图像向目标图像迁移复杂光照效果时效果不佳。

Method: 使用两个微调的扩散模型进行生成式解耦，准确分离图像内容和光照效果，构建百万级图像-内容-光照三元组数据集，然后使用IC-Light作为生成模型进行训练。

Result: TransLight成为首个成功在不同图像间迁移光照效果的方法，提供比现有技术更定制化的光照控制。

Conclusion: 该方法为光照协调和编辑研究开辟了新方向，实现了高度灵活的光照控制。

Abstract: Most existing illumination-editing approaches fail to simultaneously provide
customized control of light effects and preserve content integrity. This makes
them less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially
in the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference
image to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose
TransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom
transfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image
is the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in
the complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are
highly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first
present Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used
to accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly
curated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ
IC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,
injecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.
The resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of
diverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from
reference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with
highly flexible illumination control. Experimental results establish TransLight
as the first method to successfully transfer light effects across disparate
images, delivering more customized illumination control than existing
techniques and charting new directions for research in illumination
harmonization and editing.

Motivation: 传统帧相机在道路分割中存在延迟高和计算量大的问题，事件相机提供了低功耗感知的替代方案，但缺乏标注数据限制了预训练权重的迁移。

Method: 提出EventSSEG方法，采用事件计算和概率注意力机制，利用事件相机的自监督学习来避免对大量标注数据的依赖。

Result: 在DSEC-Semantic和DDD17数据集上的实验表明，EventSSEG仅需少量标注事件就能达到最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该方法充分发挥了事件相机的优势，有效解决了标注事件数据稀缺的问题，为自动驾驶车辆提供了低延迟、低计算的道路分割解决方案。

Abstract: Road segmentation is pivotal for autonomous vehicles, yet achieving low
latency and low compute solutions using frame based cameras remains a
challenge. Event cameras offer a promising alternative. To leverage their low
power sensing, we introduce EventSSEG, a method for road segmentation that uses
event only computing and a probabilistic attention mechanism. Event only
computing poses a challenge in transferring pretrained weights from the
conventional camera domain, requiring abundant labeled data, which is scarce.
To overcome this, EventSSEG employs event-based self supervised learning,
eliminating the need for extensive labeled data. Experiments on DSEC-Semantic
and DDD17 show that EventSSEG achieves state of the art performance with
minimal labeled events. This approach maximizes event cameras capabilities and
addresses the lack of labeled events.

TL;DR: 本研究通过AI分析2533名患者的CT/MRI影像，建立了0-90岁胰腺形态的年龄变化趋势参考标准，发现2型糖尿病患者的胰腺大小和形状与正常人群存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解胰腺随年龄变化的正常模式对于检测2型糖尿病和其他胰腺疾病的异常变化至关重要，需要建立可靠的临床影像测量方法和规范性年龄趋势参考。

Method: 分析2533例腹部CT/MRI影像，采用自动化方法分割胰腺并提取13个形态特征，使用GAMLSS回归模型比较1350名匹配患者的糖尿病相关形态差异。

Result: 调整混杂因素后，13个形态特征中有10个在2型糖尿病患者和对照组之间存在显著差异(p<0.05)，MRI与CT的测量结果也存在差异，证实2型糖尿病患者胰腺较小。

Conclusion: 研究提供了大规模非糖尿病对照组的胰腺形态寿命参考标准，证实2型糖尿病会改变胰腺的大小和形状，为临床诊断提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting
deviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas
size and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals
are to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas
measurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect
potential deviations in type 2 diabetes.
  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged
with abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,
segmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological
pancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI
measurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.
Second, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns
stratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model
pancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2
diabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with
type 2 diabetes.
  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13
morphological features were significantly different between patients with type
2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons
corrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas
measurements than CT using our AI-based method.
  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape
of the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and
675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is
smaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan
pancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a
clinical setting.

TL;DR: 提出多骨架对比学习框架MS-CLR，通过跨骨架对齐学习结构不变性，在NTU数据集上实现SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法依赖单一骨架规范，限制了在不同关节结构和解剖覆盖数据集上的泛化能力

Method: 提出MS-CLR自监督框架，从同一序列中提取多个骨架规范并对齐姿态表示，使用改进的ST-GCN架构处理不同关节布局

Result: 在NTU RGB+D 60和120数据集上持续超越单骨架对比学习基线，多骨架集成进一步提升性能达到SOTA

Conclusion: 多骨架对比学习能够学习更具表达力和泛化能力的特征，通过结构不变性捕获多样解剖线索

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained significant attention in skeleton-based
action recognition for its ability to learn robust representations from
unlabeled data. However, existing methods rely on a single skeleton convention,
which limits their ability to generalize across datasets with diverse joint
structures and anatomical coverage. We propose Multi-Skeleton Contrastive
Learning (MS-CLR), a general self-supervised framework that aligns pose
representations across multiple skeleton conventions extracted from the same
sequence. This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture
diverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable
features. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons
with varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.
Experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR
consistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive
learning baselines. A multi-skeleton ensemble further boosts performance,
setting new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将几何和运动解耦，先重建不同状态下的物体形状，再通过后处理对齐估计关节运动。这种分离使重建流程复杂化，限制了可扩展性，特别是对于具有复杂多部件关节的物体。

Method: 使用关节化3D高斯分布的统一表示方法，联合建模几何和运动。该方法改进了运动分解的鲁棒性，并提出了MPArt-90基准测试集，包含20个类别90个关节物体。

Result: 方法在部件级几何重建和运动估计方面始终实现卓越精度，支持多达20个部件的复杂关节系统，显著优于先前方法（通常只能处理2-3个部件）。

Conclusion: 统一关节表示在可扩展物理建模中具有巨大潜力，可应用于机器人仿真和人-场景交互建模等下游任务。

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects is essential for building digital twins of
interactive environments. However, prior methods typically decouple geometry
and motion by first reconstructing object shape in distinct states and then
estimating articulation through post-hoc alignment. This separation complicates
the reconstruction pipeline and restricts scalability, especially for objects
with complex, multi-part articulation. We introduce a unified representation
that jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This
formulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports
articulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior
approaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.
To systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a
new benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each
with diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry
reconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types. We
further demonstrate applicability to downstream tasks such as robotic
simulation and human-scene interaction modeling, highlighting the potential of
unified articulated representations in scalable physical modeling.

TL;DR: 本研究提出改进的dRRT算法，通过四种策略优化无人机路径规划，在仿真环境中相比传统算法表现出更高的成功率和更优路径质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机从'技术工具'向'治理基础设施'转型，在低空经济和智慧城市需求驱动下，需要解决能耗、避障和空域约束等挑战，高效路径规划变得至关重要

Method: 提出增强型快速探索随机树算法(dRRT)，包含四种策略：目标偏向加速收敛、动态步长平衡探索与避障、绕行优先选择水平绕行而非垂直爬升、B样条平滑提升路径平滑度

Result: 在500立方米城市环境仿真中，dRRT相比传统RRT、A*和蚁群算法表现更优：100%成功率、平均运行时间0.01468秒、更短路径、更少航点、更平滑轨迹（最大偏航角<45度）

Conclusion: dRRT在公共管理场景如应急响应和交通监控中具有高效部署潜力，但存在计算开销增加和目标偏向可能导致局部最优的局限性，需要与实时避障框架集成

Abstract: This study investigates the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
public management, focusing on optimizing path planning to address challenges
such as energy consumption, obstacle avoidance, and airspace constraints. As
UAVs transition from 'technical tools' to 'governance infrastructure', driven
by advancements in low-altitude economy policies and smart city demands,
efficient path planning becomes critical. The research proposes an enhanced
Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (dRRT), incorporating four strategies:
Target Bias (to accelerate convergence), Dynamic Step Size (to balance
exploration and obstacle navigation), Detour Priority (to prioritize horizontal
detours over vertical ascents), and B-spline smoothing (to enhance path
smoothness). Simulations in a 500 m3 urban environment with randomized
buildings demonstrate dRRT's superiority over traditional RRT, A*, and Ant
Colony Optimization (ACO). Results show dRRT achieves a 100\% success rate with
an average runtime of 0.01468s, shorter path lengths, fewer waypoints, and
smoother trajectories (maximum yaw angles <45{\deg}). Despite improvements,
limitations include increased computational overhead from added mechanisms and
potential local optima due to goal biasing. The study highlights dRRT's
potential for efficient UAV deployment in public management scenarios like
emergency response and traffic monitoring, while underscoring the need for
integration with real-time obstacle avoidance frameworks. This work contributes
to interdisciplinary advancements in urban governance, robotics, and
computational optimization.

Motivation: 实际应用中人形机器人需要执行短距移动到SE(2)目标位式，要求动作快速、稳健且能消有效。现有方法优化速度跟踪而非直接位置到达，导致短距任务中效率低下的行走行为。

Method: 提出了一种基于强化学习的方法，采用新的星座基于奖励函数，鼓励自然和高效的目标导向移动，直接优化SE(2)目标到达。

Result: 通过新的性能测评框架评估，该方法在能消、到达时间和脚步数方面均明显优于标准方法，并成功实现了从模拟到硬件的迁移。

Conclusion: 研究结果高度说明了针对性奖励设计对实际短距人形机器人移动的重要性，为实际应用提供了更高效、更自然的移动解决方案。

Abstract: Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute
task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical,
these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While
learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods
optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in
inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this
work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes
humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new
constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient
target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking
framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count
on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design
for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

Abstract: This work presents an optimization-based task and motion planning (TAMP)
framework that unifies planning for locomotion and manipulation through a
shared representation of contact modes. We define symbolic actions as contact
mode changes, grounding high-level planning in low-level motion. This enables a
unified search that spans task, contact, and motion planning while
incorporating whole-body dynamics, as well as all constraints between the
robot, the manipulated object, and the environment. Results on a humanoid
platform show that our method can generate a broad range of physically
consistent loco-manipulation behaviors over long action sequences requiring
complex reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
enables the resolution of an integrated TAMP formulation with fully acyclic
planning and whole body dynamics with actuation constraints for the humanoid

Conclusion: CCGAN-GP能有效促进跨领域技能迁移，为开发更适应性强和可泛化的软机器人控制器铺平道路

Abstract: Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft
robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require
precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other
physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of
these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned
in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different
physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,
as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative
adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain
to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to
adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a
domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in
both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments
across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise
perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP
effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation and path planning in continuous state and action
spaces with uncertain environments remains an open challenge. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most popular paradigms for solving
this task, but its real-world application has been limited due to sample
inefficiency and long training periods. Moreover, the existing works using RL
for multi-robot navigation lack formal guarantees while designing the
environment. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and highly customizable
environment for continuous-control multi-robot navigation, where the robots
must visit a set of regions of interest (ROIs) by following the shortest paths.
The task is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We describe
the multi-robot navigation task as an optimization problem and relate it to
finding an optimal policy for the MDP. We crafted several variations of the
environment and measured the performance using both gradient and non-gradient
based RL methods: A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ and ARS. To show real-world
applicability, we deployed our environment to a 3-D agricultural field with
uncertainties using the CoppeliaSim robot simulator and measured the robustness
by running inference on the learned models. We believe our work will guide the
researchers on how to develop MDP-based environments that are applicable to
real-world systems and solve them using the existing state-of-the-art RL
methods with limited resources and within reasonable time periods.

contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder
successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of
generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and
physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,
object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These
key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into
smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To
ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy
trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while
correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we
introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the
control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and
tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates
realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,
achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and
enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance
on our project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/simgen_hoi.

Result: 该控制器在根址方差错误、计算时间和CPU能消耗方面都表现优异，跟踪性能可与基准方法相比或更好，但计算效率和能消显著提升。

Conclusion: 牛顿-拉富森流基跟踪控制器在真实航空环境中具有实用价值，能在保持高性能跟踪的同时大幅降低计算资源需求，适用于计算能力有限的嵌入式系统。

Abstract: We investigate the performance of a lightweight tracking controller, based on
a flow version of the Newton-Raphson method, applied to a miniature blimp and a
mid-size quadrotor. This tracking technique has been shown to enjoy theoretical
guarantees of performance and has been applied with success in simulation
studies and on mobile robots with simple motion models. This paper investigates
the technique through real-world flight experiments on aerial hardware
platforms subject to realistic deployment and onboard computational
constraints. The technique's performance is assessed in comparison with the
established control frameworks of feedback linearization for the blimp, and
nonlinear model predictive control for both quadrotor and blimp. The
performance metrics under consideration are (i) root mean square error of
flight trajectories with respect to target trajectories, (ii) algorithms'
computation times, and (iii) CPU energy consumption associated with the control
algorithms. The experimental findings show that the Newton-Raphson flow-based
tracking controller achieves comparable or superior tracking performance to the
baseline methods with substantially reduced computation time and energy
expenditure.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在障碍物环境中的安全探索，优先保障机器人安全的同时有效探索未知区域，验证了所提策略的可行性

Abstract: This paper suggests a 2D exploration strategy for a planar space cluttered
with obstacles. Rather than using point robots capable of adjusting their
position and altitude instantly, this research is tailored to classical agents
with circular footprints that cannot control instantly their pose. Inhere, a
self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive system is used to explore the
place. The system is equipped with linear accelerometers and angular
gyroscopes, a 3D-LiDAR, and a forward-facing RGB-D camera. The system performs
RTAB-SLAM using the IMU and the LiDAR, while the camera is used for loop
closures. The mobile agent explores the planar space using a safe skeleton
approach that places the agent as far as possible from the static obstacles.
During the exploration strategy, the heading is towards any offered openings of
the space. This space exploration strategy has as its highest priority the
agent's safety in avoiding the obstacles followed by the exploration of
undetected space. Experimental studies with a ROS-enabled mobile agent are
presented indicating the path planning strategy while exploring the space.

Motivation: 空间机械臂系统在微重力环境下的控制面临重大挑战，主要是由于机械臂与航天器基座之间的动态耦合。研究探索利用生物灵感来解决这一问题。

Method: 从高速视频记录中提取动物空中翻正运动轨迹，使用多目标优化框架分析关键行为目标及其相对重要性，将得到的运动曲线作为空间机械臂系统的参考轨迹进行跟踪控制。

Conclusion: 生物启发方法为空间机器人控制提供了新的解决方案，通过借鉴动物在类似环境中的进化行为，可以开发出更有效的控制策略。

Abstract: Robotic arms mounted on spacecraft, known as space manipulator systems
(SMSs), are critical for enabling on-orbit assembly, satellite servicing, and
debris removal. However, controlling these systems in microgravity remains a
significant challenge due to the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and
the spacecraft base. This study explores the potential of using biological
inspiration to address this issue, focusing on animals, particularly lizards,
that exhibit mid-air righting reflexes. Based on similarities between SMSs and
these animals in terms of behavior, morphology, and environment, their
air-righting motion trajectories are extracted from high-speed video recordings
using computer vision techniques. These trajectories are analyzed within a
multi-objective optimization framework to identify the key behavioral goals and
assess their relative importance. The resulting motion profiles are then
applied as reference trajectories for SMS control, with baseline controllers
used to track them. The findings provide a step toward translating evolved
animal behaviors into interpretable, adaptive control strategies for space
robotics, with implications for improving maneuverability and robustness in
future missions.

Conclusion: 所提出的增强型LIO框架通过自适应异常值处理和扫描到子地图配准策略，有效解决了LiDAR特征退化问题，显著提高了在复杂环境中的定位性能。

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) plays a vital role in achieving accurate
localization and mapping, especially in complex environments. However, the
presence of LiDAR feature degeneracy poses a major challenge to reliable state
estimation. To overcome this issue, we propose an enhanced LIO framework that
integrates adaptive outlier-tolerant correspondence with a scan-to-submap
registration strategy. The core contribution lies in an adaptive outlier
removal threshold, which dynamically adjusts based on point-to-sensor distance
and the motion amplitude of platform. This mechanism improves the robustness of
feature matching in varying conditions. Moreover, we introduce a flexible
scan-to-submap registration method that leverages IMU data to refine pose
estimation, particularly in degenerate geometric configurations. To further
enhance localization accuracy, we design a novel weighting matrix that fuses
IMU preintegration covariance with a degeneration metric derived from the
scan-to-submap process. Extensive experiments conducted in both indoor and
outdoor environments-characterized by sparse or degenerate features-demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms
of both robustness and accuracy.

Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring
safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications.
In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained
Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn
from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge
of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the
expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this
mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which
replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that
follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.
Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it
via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the
expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated
by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks
and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of
sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fair-CoPlan是一个用于城市空中交通(UAM)的半分布式公平飞行规划器，通过运营商和服务提供商协作计算公平的飞行路径，在保证安全的同时实现路径长度的公平分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UAM飞行规划器可能导致某些无人机获得不成比例的短路径，而其他无人机承担不公平的代价，这会影响运营商参与UAM的积极性。

Method: 采用三步法：1)服务提供商基于垂直起降场容量约束起降选择；2)运营商在约束下独立规划；3)服务提供商解决路径冲突，优化路径长度公平性。

Result: 仿真实验显示Fair-CoPlan相比非公平规划器产生更公平的结果，仅以轻微延迟为代价。

Conclusion: Fair-CoPlan通过公平分摊解冲突成本，促进了UAM的广泛参与，确保了空域安全，并提供了更大的运营商灵活性。

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging transportation paradigm in which
Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) autonomously transport passengers and goods in
cities. The UAS have different operators with different, sometimes competing
goals, yet must share the airspace. We propose a negotiated, semi-distributed
flight planner that optimizes UAS' flight lengths {\em in a fair manner}.
Current flight planners might result in some UAS being given disproportionately
shorter flight paths at the expense of others. We introduce Fair-CoPlan, a
planner in which operators and a Provider of Service to the UAM (PSU) together
compute \emph{fair} flight paths. Fair-CoPlan has three steps: First, the PSU
constrains take-off and landing choices for flights based on capacity at and
around vertiports. Then, operators plan independently under these constraints.
Finally, the PSU resolves any conflicting paths, optimizing for path length
fairness. By fairly spreading the cost of deconfliction Fair-CoPlan encourages
wider participation in UAM, ensures safety of the airspace and the areas below
it, and promotes greater operator flexibility. We demonstrate Fair-CoPlan
through simulation experiments and find fairer outcomes than a non-fair planner
with minor delays as a trade-off.

Conclusion: FiReFly算法成功将公平性概念融入多机器人运动规划，在保证任务成功的同时实现了能耗的公平分配，具有良好的可扩展性

Abstract: We propose injecting notions of fairness into multi-robot motion planning.
When robots have competing interests, it is important to optimize for some kind
of fairness in their usage of resources. In this work, we explore how the
robots' energy expenditures might be fairly distributed among them, while
maintaining mission success. We formulate a distributed fair motion planner and
integrate it with safe controllers in a algorithm called FiReFly. For simulated
reach-avoid missions, FiReFly produces fairer trajectories and improves mission
success rates over a non-fair planner. We find that real-time performance is
achievable up to 15 UAVs, and that scaling up to 50 UAVs is possible with
trade-offs between runtime and fairness improvements.

Conclusion: 动态表示预训练能有效缓解离线模仿学习中的数据限制问题，实现从模拟到真实世界的知识迁移

Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation
learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited
expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics
representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We
first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL
lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to
learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be
learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the
reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We
present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to
learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on
MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with
as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can
leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to
walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

Conclusion: 该框架成功将LLM的开放世界推理能力与模型优化方法结合，有效解决了在线适应性和可解释性关键问题。

Abstract: Online coordination of multi-robot systems in open and unknown environments
faces significant challenges, particularly when semantic features detected
during operation dynamically trigger new tasks. Recent large language model
(LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on
one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic
adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the
processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM)
for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i)
a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks
specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an
online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and
explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an
optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via
search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop
verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both
subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected
online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning
capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods,
simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and
explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances,
with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks
completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during
adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation is a long-standing challenge in robotics due
to complex contact dynamics and partial observability. While humans synergize
vision and touch for such tasks, robotic approaches often prioritize one
modality, therefore limiting adaptability. This paper introduces Flow Before
Imitation (FBI), a visuotactile imitation learning framework that dynamically
fuses tactile interactions with visual observations through motion dynamics.
Unlike prior static fusion methods, FBI establishes a causal link between
tactile signals and object motion via a dynamics-aware latent model. FBI
employs a transformer-based interaction module to fuse flow-derived tactile
features with visual inputs, training a one-step diffusion policy for real-time
execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms the baseline methods in both simulation and the real world on two
customized in-hand manipulation tasks and three standard dexterous manipulation
tasks. Code, models, and more results are available in the website

Abstract: Despite extensive developments in motion planning of autonomous aerial

deadlock in complex dynamic environments, leading to increased collision risks.
To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided

In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is
proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend
utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and
dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance
and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch
trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal
topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical

TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate
and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments.
Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the
proposed method.

Abstract: The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for
solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the
question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in
multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to
solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor,
prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known
graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying
needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a
suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant
actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new
insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded
multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于动态环境中移动目标主动映射的信息路径规划框架，包含时空预测网络和自适应规划目标，在仿真和实地测试中验证了优于现有方法的性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动机器人平台在环境监测等任务中的应用日益增多，动态环境中的高效目标跟踪对于搜救和污染物清理等应用至关重要。漂浮目标因风和水流等环境扰动而漂移，需要同时预测空间和时间变化。

Method: 提出了一个信息路径规划框架，包含时空预测网络来预测目标位置分布随时间的变化，并设计了自适应规划目标来优化目标跟踪性能。

Result: 仿真实验表明，相比仅考虑熵减少的现有方法，提出的规划目标显著提高了目标跟踪性能。通过自主水面车辆进行的实地测试验证了该方法在真实监测场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了动态环境中移动目标的主动映射问题，提出的时空预测和自适应规划方法为实际环境监测应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile robot platforms are increasingly being used to automate information
gathering tasks such as environmental monitoring. Efficient target tracking in
dynamic environments is critical for applications such as search and rescue and
pollutant cleanups. In this letter, we study active mapping of floating targets
that drift due to environmental disturbances such as wind and currents. This is
a challenging problem as it involves predicting both spatial and temporal
variations in the map due to changing conditions. We propose an informative
path planning framework to map an arbitrary number of moving targets with
initially unknown positions in dynamic environments. A key component of our
approach is a spatiotemporal prediction network that predicts target position
distributions over time. We propose an adaptive planning objective for target
tracking that leverages these predictions. Simulation experiments show that our
proposed planning objective improves target tracking performance compared to
existing methods that consider only entropy reduction as the planning
objective. Finally, we validate our approach in field tests using an autonomous
surface vehicle, showcasing its ability to track targets in real-world
monitoring scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出M-ESEKF滤波器，通过在降维流形空间中表示机器人位姿，提高地面车辆定位的长期精度和一致性，无需人工约束或简化。

Conclusion: M-ESEKF提供了一种改进的地面车辆定位方法，通过流形表示和领域知识嵌入，显著提高了滤波器的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Aiming to enhance the consistency and thus long-term accuracy of Extended
Kalman Filters for terrestrial vehicle localization, this paper introduces the
Manifold Error State Extended Kalman Filter (M-ESEKF). By representing the
robot's pose in a space with reduced dimensionality, the approach ensures
feasible estimates on generic smooth surfaces, without introducing artificial
constraints or simplifications that may degrade a filter's performance. The
accompanying measurement models are compatible with common loosely- and
tightly-coupled sensor modalities and also implicitly account for the ground
geometry. We extend the formulation by introducing a novel correction scheme
that embeds additional domain knowledge into the sensor data, giving more
accurate uncertainty approximations and further enhancing filter consistency.
The proposed estimator is seamlessly integrated into a validated modular state
estimation framework, demonstrating compatibility with existing
implementations. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations across diverse scenarios and
dynamic sensor configurations show that the M-ESEKF outperforms classical
filter formulations in terms of consistency and stability. Moreover, it
eliminates the need for scenario-specific parameter tuning, enabling its
application in a variety of real-world settings.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种用于肉类加工机器人的安全和透明性框架，解决人机协作中的安全风险和消除人员对机器人操作的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肉类加工行业面临严重的劳务短缺问题，现有自动化技术专门化程度高、灵活性差、成本昂贵。需要开发通用型机器人系统与人类协同工作，但人机协作存在安全风险和透明性两大挑战。

Method: 开发了一个安全和透明性框架：1）手部检测系统监控人员安全，在危险情况下停止机器人；2）配备力传感器的刀具系统，识别刀刷物体类型；3）通过LED界面和图形界面呈现机器人操作不确定性和计划，允许人员反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了肉类加工中人机协作的安全和透明性挑战，为通用型机器人系统的应用提供了可行方案，有助于提升肉类加工行业的自动化水平和作业质量。

Abstract: Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated
technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and
enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly
specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers
to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to
develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform
multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry
experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these
collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to
ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand
what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a
safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots.
For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors
nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human
comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an
instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact
between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce
a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an
LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we
design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the
human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure
safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's
actions which we validate through a user study.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音生物标志物（如语音、咳嗽、呼吸）在精神健康和神经退行性疾病检测方面具有潜力，但临床采用受到公开数据集质量不一致和可用性有限的限制。

Method: 使用FAIR数据成熟度模型和结构化优先级加权评分方法，在子原则、原则和综合层面评估了27个公开语音生物标志物数据集的FAIR程度。

Result: 分析显示可查找性普遍较高，但在可访问性、互操作性和可重用性方面存在显著差异和弱点。精神健康数据集FAIR分数变异性更大，神经退行性数据集稍更一致。存储库选择显著影响FAIR分数。

Conclusion: 建议采用结构化领域特定元数据标准、优先选择FAIR兼容存储库、常规应用结构化FAIR评估框架，以提高数据集互操作性和重用性，加速语音生物标志物技术的临床转化。

Abstract: Voice biomarkers--human-generated acoustic signals such as speech, coughing,
and breathing--are promising tools for scalable, non-invasive detection and
monitoring of mental health and neurodegenerative diseases. Yet, their clinical
adoption remains constrained by inconsistent quality and limited usability of
publicly available datasets. To address this gap, we present the first
systematic FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) evaluation of
27 publicly available voice biomarker datasets focused on these disease areas.
Using the FAIR Data Maturity Model and a structured, priority-weighted scoring
method, we assessed FAIRness at subprinciple, principle, and composite levels.
Our analysis revealed consistently high Findability but substantial variability
and weaknesses in Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability. Mental
health datasets exhibited greater variability in FAIR scores, while
neurodegenerative datasets were slightly more consistent. Repository choice
also significantly influenced FAIRness scores. To enhance dataset quality and
clinical utility, we recommend adopting structured, domain-specific metadata
standards, prioritizing FAIR-compliant repositories, and routinely applying
structured FAIR evaluation frameworks. These findings provide actionable
guidance to improve dataset interoperability and reuse, thereby accelerating
the clinical translation of voice biomarker technologies.

Result: 在cSDR指标上达到11.03dB的当前最佳性能，uSDR指标也有显著提升，在不同输入长度和人声出现模式上表现稳定一致

Conclusion: Mamba-based模型在高分辨率音频处理中表现出色，为音频研究开辟了新的方向，展示了状态空间模型在音频领域的应用潜力

Abstract: We introduce a new music source separation model tailored for accurate vocal
isolation. Unlike Transformer-based approaches, which often fail to capture
intermittently occurring vocals, our model leverages Mamba2, a recent state
space model, to better capture long-range temporal dependencies. To handle long
input sequences efficiently, we combine a band-splitting strategy with a
dual-path architecture. Experiments show that our approach outperforms recent
state-of-the-art models, achieving a cSDR of 11.03 dB-the best reported to
date-and delivering substantial gains in uSDR. Moreover, the model exhibits
stable and consistent performance across varying input lengths and vocal
occurrence patterns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba-based
models for high-resolution audio processing and open up new directions for
broader applications in audio research.

Abstract: Perceptualizing tool interactions with deformable structures in surgical
procedures remains challenging, as unimodal visualization techniques often fail
to capture the complexity of these interactions due to constraints such as
occlusion and limited depth perception. This paper presents a novel approach to
augment tool navigation in mixed reality environments by providing auditory
representations of tool-tissue dynamics, particularly for interactions with
soft tissue. BioSonix, a physics-informed design framework, utilizes tissue
displacements in 3D space to compute excitation forces for a sound model
encoding tissue properties such as stiffness and density. Biomechanical
simulations were employed to model particle displacements resulting from
tool-tissue interactions, establishing a robust foundation for the method. An
optimization approach was used to define configurations for capturing diverse
interaction scenarios with varying tool trajectories. Experiments were
conducted to validate the accuracy of the sound-displacement mappings.
Additionally, two user studies were performed: the first involved two clinical
professionals (a neuroradiologist and a cardiologist), who confirmed the
method's impact and achieved high task accuracy; the second included 22
biomedical experts, who demonstrated high discrimination accuracy in tissue
differentiation and targeting tasks. The results revealed a strong correlation
between tool-tissue dynamics and their corresponding auditory profiles,
highlighting the potential of these sound representations to enhance the
intuitive understanding of complex interactions.

Abstract: Pre-trained foundation models have demonstrated remarkable success in vision
and language, yet their potential for general machine signal modeling-covering
acoustic, vibration, and other industrial sensor data-remains under-explored.
Existing approach using sub-band-based encoders has achieved competitive
results but are limited by fixed input lengths, and the absence of explicit
frequency positional encoding. In this work, we propose a novel foundation
model that integrates an advanced band-split architecture with relative
frequency positional embeddings, enabling precise spectral localization across
arbitrary sampling configurations. The model supports inputs of arbitrary
length without padding or segmentation, producing a concise embedding that
retains both temporal and spectral fidelity. We evaluate our method on SIREN
(https://github.com/yucongzh/SIREN), a newly introduced large-scale benchmark
for machine signal encoding that unifies multiple datasets, including all DCASE
task 2 challenges (2020-2025) and widely-used industrial signal corpora.
Experimental results demonstrate consistent state-of-the-art performance in
anomaly detection and fault identification, confirming the effectiveness and
generalization capability of the proposed model. We open-sourced ECHO on

Abstract: Inverse rendering aims to reconstruct geometry and reflectance from captured
images. Display-camera imaging systems offer unique advantages for this task:
each pixel can easily function as a programmable point light source, and the
polarized light emitted by LCD displays facilitates diffuse-specular
separation. Despite these benefits, there is currently no public real-world
dataset captured using display-camera systems, unlike other setups such as
light stages. This absence hinders the development and evaluation of
display-based inverse rendering methods. In this paper, we introduce the first
real-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering. To achieve this, we
construct and calibrate an imaging system comprising an LCD display and stereo
polarization cameras. We then capture a diverse set of objects with diverse
geometry and reflectance under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns. We
also provide high-quality ground-truth geometry. Our dataset enables the
synthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different
noise levels. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing
photometric stereo and inverse rendering methods, and provide a simple, yet
effective baseline for display inverse rendering, outperforming
state-of-the-art inverse rendering methods. Code and dataset are available on

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications
like reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often
rely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,
restricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To
address these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that
reconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python
scripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs
capable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we
construct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each
object is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a
multimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into
executable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior
performance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates
intuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code
modifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these
contributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for
programmatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D human bodies from sparse views has been an appealing topic,
which is crucial to broader the related applications. In this paper, we propose
a quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only
two images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier
for users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the
difficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from
the highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on
foundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input
images have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an
enhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information,
and then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are
directly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality.
Experiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on
a single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain
datasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with
images captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data
collection. Demos and code are available at

Abstract: Advancements in accessibility technologies such as low-cost swell form
printers or refreshable tactile displays promise to allow blind or low-vision
(BLV) people to analyze data by transforming visual representations directly to
tactile representations. However, it is possible that design guidelines derived
from experiments on the visual perception system may not be suited for the
tactile perception system. We investigate the potential mismatch between
familiar visual encodings and tactile perception in an exploratory study into
the strategies employed by BLV people to measure common graphical primitives
converted to tactile representations. First, we replicate the Cleveland and
McGill study on graphical perception using swell form printing with eleven BLV
subjects. Then, we present results from a group interview in which we describe
the strategies used by our subjects to read four common chart types. While our
results suggest that familiar encodings based on visual perception studies can
be useful in tactile graphics, our subjects also expressed a desire to use
encodings designed explicitly for BLV people. Based on this study, we identify
gaps between the perceptual expectations of common charts and the perceptual
tools available in tactile perception. Then, we present a set of guidelines for
the design of tactile graphics that accounts for these gaps. Supplemental

Abstract: Computational notebooks, which integrate code, documentation, tags, and
visualizations into a single document, have become increasingly popular for
data analysis tasks. With the advent of immersive technologies, these notebooks
have evolved into a new paradigm, enabling more interactive and intuitive ways
to perform data analysis. An immersive computational notebook, which integrates
computational notebooks within an immersive environment, significantly enhances
navigation performance with embodied interactions. However, despite recognizing
the significance of organizational strategies in the immersive data science
process, the organizational strategies for using immersive notebooks remain
largely unexplored. In response, our research aims to deepen our understanding
of organizations, especially focusing on spatial structures for computational
notebooks, and to examine how various execution orders can be visualized in an
immersive context. Through an exploratory user study, we found participants
preferred organizing notebooks in half-cylindrical structures and engaged
significantly more in non-linear analysis. Notably, as the scale of the
notebooks increased (i.e., more code cells), users increasingly adopted
multiple, concurrent non-linear analytical approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有笔记生成工具无法全面保留视频信息，也不能满足用户对多样化呈现格式和交互功能的需求。

Method: 采用新颖的流水线技术，从教学视频中忠实提取层次结构和多模态关键信息，并提供交互界面让用户自定义笔记内容和呈现格式。

Result: 技术评估和用户研究（N=36）显示，在客观指标上表现良好，用户反馈积极，证明了流水线的有效性和系统的整体可用性。

Conclusion: NoteIt系统成功解决了教学视频笔记生成的全面性和交互性问题，为用户提供了高效的笔记生成和定制体验。

Abstract: Users often take notes for instructional videos to access key knowledge later
without revisiting long videos. Automated note generation tools enable users to
obtain informative notes efficiently. However, notes generated by existing
research or off-the-shelf tools fail to preserve the information conveyed in
the original videos comprehensively, nor can they satisfy users' expectations
for diverse presentation formats and interactive features when using notes
digitally. In this work, we present NoteIt, a system, which automatically
converts instructional videos to interactable notes using a novel pipeline that
faithfully extracts hierarchical structure and multimodal key information from
videos. With NoteIt's interface, users can interact with the system to further
customize the content and presentation formats of the notes according to their
preferences. We conducted both a technical evaluation and a comparison user
study (N=36). The solid performance in objective metrics and the positive user
feedback demonstrated the effectiveness of the pipeline and the overall
usability of NoteIt. Project website: https://zhaorunning.github.io/NoteIt/

TL;DR: 本研究通过EEG和眼动追踪技术，结合N400事件相关电位和行为标记，开发了多模态模型来检测阅读中的困惑状态，准确率达到77.3-89.6%，为实时监测用户困惑的自适应系统奠定了基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在阅读过程中经常会遇到信息冲突或超出理解能力的情况，导致困惑并影响学习效果。需要开发能够实时检测阅读困惑的技术来改善学习体验。

Method: 使用EEG和眼动追踪技术收集11名成年参与者的神经和注视数据，通过分析N400事件相关电位（语义不一致的神经标记）并结合眼动行为标记，采用机器学习方法构建多模态分类模型。

Result: 多模态（EEG+眼动追踪）模型比单模态基线分类准确率提高4-22%，平均加权参与者准确率达到77.3%，最佳准确率达到89.6%。研究发现大脑颞叶区域在困惑神经特征中起主导作用。

Conclusion: 研究为开发可穿戴、低电极脑机接口用于实时监测用户困惑提供了基础，具有在个性化学习、人机交互和可访问性等领域应用的潜力。

Abstract: Humans regularly navigate an overwhelming amount of information via text
media, whether reading articles, browsing social media, or interacting with
chatbots. Confusion naturally arises when new information conflicts with or
exceeds a reader's comprehension or prior knowledge, posing a challenge for
learning. In this study, we present a multimodal investigation of
reading-induced confusion using EEG and eye tracking. We collected neural and
gaze data from 11 adult participants as they read short paragraphs sampled from
diverse, real-world sources. By isolating the N400 event-related potential
(ERP), a well-established neural marker of semantic incongruence, and
integrating behavioral markers from eye tracking, we provide a detailed
analysis of the neural and behavioral correlates of confusion during
naturalistic reading. Using machine learning, we show that multimodal (EEG +
eye tracking) models improve classification accuracy by 4-22% over unimodal
baselines, reaching an average weighted participant accuracy of 77.3% and a
best accuracy of 89.6%. Our results highlight the dominance of the brain's
temporal regions in these neural signatures of confusion, suggesting avenues
for wearable, low-electrode brain-computer interfaces (BCI) for real-time
monitoring. These findings lay the foundation for developing adaptive systems
that dynamically detect and respond to user confusion, with potential
applications in personalized learning, human-computer interaction, and
accessibility.

Abstract: Since the introduction of Industry 4.0, digital twin technology has
significantly evolved, laying the groundwork for a transition toward Industry
5.0 principles centered on human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience.
Through digital twins, real-time connected production systems are anticipated
to be more efficient, resilient, and sustainable, facilitating communication
and connectivity between digital and physical systems. However, environmental
performance and integration with virtual reality (VR) and artificial
intelligence (AI) of such systems remain challenging. Further exploration of
digital twin technologies is needed to validate the real-world impact and
benefits. This paper investigates these challenges by implementing a real-time
digital twin based on the ISO 23247 standard, connecting the physical factory
and simulation software with VR capabilities. This digital twin system provides
cognitive assistance and a user-friendly interface for operators, thereby
improving cognitive ergonomics. The connection of the Internet of Things (IoT)
platform allows the digital twin to have real-time bidirectional communication,
collaboration, monitoring, and assistance. A lab-scale drone factory was used
as the digital twin application to test and evaluate the ISO 23247 standard and
its potential benefits. Additionally, AI integration and environmental
performance Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been considered as the next
stages in improving VR-integrated digital twins. With a solid theoretical
foundation and a demonstration of the VR-integrated digital twins, this paper
addresses integration issues between various technologies and advances the
framework of digital twins based on ISO 23247.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光子计数CT生成的多能谱数据复杂冗余，使得可视化和解释变得困难，需要一种方法将这些多体积数据集融合成单一代表性体积

Method: 计算体积对之间的2D直方图识别显著结构特征，构建极值图捕捉直方图极值的拓扑分布，通过投影降维生成统一体积

Result: 生成的信息丰富的融合体积保留了原始光谱数据的关键结构和材料特性，同时将分析范围从多个体积减少到一个

Conclusion: 该方法实现了拓扑感知的多能CT数据集融合，显著提高了可视化和分割效果

Abstract: Photon-Counting Computed Tomography (PCCT) is a novel imaging modality that
simultaneously acquires volumetric data at multiple X-ray energy levels,
generating separate volumes that capture energy-dependent attenuation
properties. Attenuation refers to the reduction in X-ray intensity as it passes
through different tissues or materials. This spectral information enhances
tissue and material differentiation, enabling more accurate diagnosis and
analysis. However, the resulting multivolume datasets are often complex and
redundant, making visualization and interpretation challenging. To address
these challenges, we propose a method for fusing spectral PCCT data into a
single representative volume that enables direct volume rendering and
segmentation by leveraging both shared and complementary information across
different channels. Our approach starts by computing 2D histograms between
pairs of volumes to identify those that exhibit prominent structural features.
These histograms reveal relationships and variations that may be difficult to
discern from individual volumes alone. Next, we construct an extremum graph
from the 2D histogram of two minimally correlated yet complementary
volumes-selected to capture both shared and distinct features-thereby
maximizing the information content. The graph captures the topological
distribution of histogram extrema. By extracting prominent structure within
this graph and projecting each grid point in histogram space onto it, we reduce
the dimensionality to one, producing a unified volume. This representative
volume retains key structural and material characteristics from the original
spectral data while significantly reducing the analysis scope from multiple
volumes to one. The result is a topology-aware, information-rich fusion of
multi-energy CT datasets that facilitates more effective visualization and
segmentation.

Motivation: AI在教育中的角色正从教学工具转变为学习过程的主动参与者，但缺乏理解、设计和评估这种新型人机协作学习范式的概念框架。

Method: 提出APCP概念框架，基于社会文化学习理论和计算机支持的协作学习理论，构建四个层次的AI代理模型，并探讨AI作为真正协作者的哲学基础。

Conclusion: 虽然AI无法实现真正的现象学伙伴关系，但可以设计为高效的功能性协作者，这对教学法、教学设计和未来AI教育研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: The role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is undergoing a rapid
transformation, moving beyond its historical function as an instructional tool
towards a new potential as an active participant in the learning process. This
shift is driven by the emergence of agentic AI, autonomous systems capable of
proactive, goal-directed action. However, the field lacks a robust conceptual
framework to understand, design, and evaluate this new paradigm of human-AI
interaction in learning. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel
conceptual framework (the APCP framework) that charts the transition from AI as
a tool to AI as a collaborative partner. We present a four-level model of
escalating AI agency within human-AI collaborative learning: (1) the AI as an
Adaptive Instrument, (2) the AI as a Proactive Assistant, (3) the AI as a
Co-Learner, and (4) the AI as a Peer Collaborator. Grounded in sociocultural
theories of learning and Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL), this
framework provides a structured vocabulary for analysing the shifting roles and
responsibilities between human and AI agents. The paper further engages in a
critical discussion of the philosophical underpinnings of collaboration,
examining whether an AI, lacking genuine consciousness or shared
intentionality, can be considered a true collaborator. We conclude that while
AI may not achieve authentic phenomenological partnership, it can be designed
as a highly effective functional collaborator. This distinction has significant
implications for pedagogy, instructional design, and the future research agenda
for AI in education, urging a shift in focus towards creating learning
environments that harness the complementary strengths of both human and AI.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出基于数字孪生的物理驱动框架，使用Unity引擎开发虚拟环境来估算弯道安全速度，相比传统AASHTO方法能提供更精确的车辆和环境特定速度估计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶和网联车辆的普及，准确估算弯道安全速度变得日益重要。传统AASHTO设计方法基于简化的点质量模型，使用保守参数，无法充分考虑车辆和环境变化

Method: 在Unity引擎中构建真实道路弯道的3D模型，集成参数化车辆模型（可调整质量、加速度和重心），通过物理驱动仿真确定车辆能安全通过弯道的最大速度

Result: 仿真生成的安全弯道速度估计与实际观测到的弯道速度值一致，验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 基于物理的数字孪生方法能够为车辆通过水平弯道提供更安全、更自适应的运行速度估计

Abstract: Horizontal curves are often associated with roadway crashes due to speed
misjudgment and loss of control. With the growing adoption of autonomous and
connected vehicles, the accurate estimation of safe speed at curves is becoming
increasingly important. The widely used AASHTO design method for safe curve
speed estimation relies on an analytical equation based on a simplified point
mass model, which often uses conservative parameters to account for vehicular
and environmental variations. This paper presents a digital twin-based
framework for estimating safe speed at curves using a physics-driven virtual
environment developed in the Unity engine. In this framework, a real-world
horizontal road curve is selected, and vehicle speed data are collected using a
radar gun under various weather conditions. A 3D model of the road curve is
constructed in a Unity environment using roadway geometric and elevation data.
A parameterized vehicle model is integrated, allowing for variations in mass,
acceleration, and center of gravity to reflect different vehicle types and
loading scenarios. This simulation identifies the maximum safe speed at which a
vehicle can traverse the given curve, providing a more vehicle and
environment-specific estimate of the safe operating speed. The study validated
that the safe curve speed estimates generated by the simulation were consistent
with the real-world speed values observed at a curve. This study demonstrates
how a physics-based digital twin can estimate a safer and more adaptive
operating speed for vehicles traversing horizontal curves.

Motivation: 现代自主系统的深度神经网络感知存在黑盒行为和敏感性问题，传统验证方法基于过于严格的假设（如有界误差或已知分布），在多样化和不确定的测试环境中有效性受限。

Method: 采用区间马尔可夫决策过程（interval MDPs）统一感知验证模型与离线验证，提供能够直接适应分布外测试条件的灵活端到端保证。

Result: 在合成感知马尔可夫链和mountain car基准测试中验证，能够保证紧密而严格的整体系统安全边界。

Conclusion: 该方法克服了传统验证方法的限制，为自主系统在不确定环境中的安全验证提供了更灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise and comprehensive situational awareness is a critical capability of
modern autonomous systems. Deep neural networks that perceive task-critical
details from rich sensory signals have become ubiquitous; however, their
black-box behavior and sensitivity to environmental uncertainty and
distribution shifts make them challenging to verify formally. Abstraction-based
verification techniques for vision-based autonomy produce safety guarantees
contingent on rigid assumptions, such as bounded errors or known unique
distributions. Such overly restrictive and inflexible assumptions limit the
validity of the guarantees, especially in diverse and uncertain test-time
environments. We propose a methodology that unifies the verification models of
perception with their offline validation. Our methodology leverages interval
MDPs and provides a flexible end-to-end guarantee that adapts directly to the
out-of-distribution test-time conditions. We evaluate our methodology on a
synthetic perception Markov chain with well-defined state estimation
distributions and a mountain car benchmark. Our findings reveal that we can
guarantee tight yet rigorous bounds on overall system safety.

TL;DR: 多电平逆变器（MLI）在部分负载优化下可显著降低电动汽车传动系统能耗和成本，3L-TNPC逆变器相比传统SiC 2L-B6基准可减少0.67 kWh/100 km的驱动循环损耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管电动汽车在过去十年取得显著进展，但传动系统能量损失仍然限制实际续航里程并增加成本，需要寻找更高效的逆变器技术。

Method: 结合1000多辆欧洲市场电动汽车数据集与详细的逆变器-电机协同仿真，评估三种逆变器拓扑结构：传统Si/SiC两电平B6逆变器，以及针对部分负载优化的两种三电平TNPC和ANPC逆变器。

Result: 平均驱动循环续航从135公里提升至455公里，但车队平均能耗保持稳定。3L-TNPC逆变器仅需30%额外SiC芯片面积，即可降低0.67 kWh/100 km的传动系统损耗。

Conclusion: 部分负载优化的多电平逆变器是进一步降低电动汽车能耗和系统总成本的经济有效途径。

Abstract: Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have advanced significantly during the past
decade, yet drivetrain energy losses continue to restrict practical range and
elevate cost. A dataset comprising more than 1000 European-market BEVs (model
years 2010-2025) is combined with detailed inverter-motor co-simulation to
chart technology progress for and quantify the efficiency and cost-saving
potential of partial-load optimised multi-level inverter (MLI) for 2030.
Average drive-cycle range has climbed from 135 km to 455 km, while
fleet-average energy consumption has remained virtually constant. Three
inverter topologies are assessed to evaluate future efficiency and cost
enhancements: a conventional two-level (2L) six halfbridge (B6) inverter with
silicon (Si) and silicon carbide (SiC) devices, and two three-level (3L) T-type
neutral point clamped (TNPC) and active neutral point clamped (ANPC) inverters
tailored for partial-load operation. The 3L-TNPC inverter, realised with only
30% additional SiC chip area, lowers drive-cycle drivetrain losses by 0.67
kWh/100 km relative to a SiC 2L-B6 baseline. These results identify
partial-load optimised MLIs as a cost-effective route to further reduce BEV
energy consumption and total system cost.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) communication
framework to support future 6G-enabled intelligent transportation systems (ITS)
in smart cities. Leveraging existing LED streetlighting infrastructure, the
system simultaneously delivers energy-efficient illumination and high-speed
wireless connectivity. The proposed scheme integrates visible light
communication (VLC) with a complementary ter-ahertz (THz) antenna array to
overcome VLC limitations under high ambient light and adverse weather
conditions. Key con-tributions include the design of a VLC/THz access network,
seamless integration with lighting infrastructure, a proposed
switching-combination (PSC) mechanism, and a physical layout optimization
strategy. Using a grid search method, thousands of configurations were
evaluated to maximize lighting coverage, re-ceived power, signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR), and minimize outage
probability. Results show that optimized lighting coverage improves from 35% to
97%, while hybrid communication coverage increases from 49%to 99.9% at the same
power level. Under extreme environmental conditions, the hybrid system
maintains up to 99% coverage, compared to 69% with VLC alone. These results
demonstrate the scalability, cost-efficiency, and practicality of the proposed
system for next-generation ITS deployment.

Abstract: Autonomy at Levels is the idea that autonomy should be embedded within and
throughout a spacecraft. Using Systems Engineering methods a spacecraft is
typically decomposed into systems, subsystems, assemblies, components, and so
on. All these decomposition levels within all the spacecraft's systems, could
and should have autonomy elements built in. As a result, the "autonomy system"
is made of autonomy elements or units that are integrated, distributed and
embedded within the whole spacecraft. This is like how the power system would
be designed and implemented. Linking control loops and autonomy loops
illustrates how to achieve Autonomy at Levels.

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了非线性MPC跟踪框架，为受扰动非线性系统提供了有效的鲁棒预测控制解决方案

Abstract: This paper presents a novel robust predictive controller for constrained
nonlinear systems that is able to track piece-wise constant setpoint signals.
The tracking model predictive controller presented in this paper extends the
nonlinear MPC for tracking to the more complex case of nonlinear systems
subject to bounded and not necessarily additive perturbations. The optimal
control problem that is solved at each step penalizes the deviation of the
predicted nominal system trajectory from an artificial reference, which is
added as a decision variable, as well as the distance between the artificial
reference and the setpoint. Robust feasibility is ensured by imposing
conservative constraints that take into account the effect of uncertainties and
convergence to a neighborhood of any feasible setpoint is guaranteed by means
of an appropriate terminal cost and an extended stabilizing terminal
constraint. In the case of unreachable setpoints, convergence to a neighborhood
of the optimal reachable steady output is also proved.

Abstract: This review analysis presents a comprehensive exploration of energy
flexibility in modern power systems. It examines the roles and mechanisms of
flexible technologies across three main categories: generators, energy storage
systems (ESS), and loads. Energy flexibility is defined as the ability to
dynamically adjust supply and/or demand in response to grid conditions to
maintain balance and stability. This is of particular importance to facilitate
the integration of the growing variable renewable energy sources (RES) into
modern power grids. Additionally, traditional supply-side mechanisms to
maintain balance and stability are complemented by advancements in demand-side
management and demand response strategies, which enable loads to adjust
consumption patterns and schedules in response to grid requirements. ESS are
also explored to further enhance flexibility by absorbing excess generation
and/or supplying large load increases that are not able to be met by the less
flexible resources. This paper also explores specific flexibility technologies,
examining their characteristics, control strategies, advantages, and
limitations. Energy flexibility services are also categorized into
intermittency mitigation, peak shaving, and energy reserve provisioning. Each
service is supported by case studies and examples demonstrating how different
resources respond to varying conditions. Ultimately, the findings and reviews
of the various flexible resources in this paper provide a roadmap for
optimizing energy flexibility across diverse resource types, paving the way for
a more sustainable and resilient energy future.

Abstract: This paper presents a numerically robust approach to multi-band disturbance
rejection using an iterative Youla-Kucera parameterization technique. The
proposed method offers precise control over shaping the frequency response of a

Meanwhile, our proposed modification of the all-stabilizing Youla-Kucera
architecture enables intuitive design while respecting fundamental performance
trade-offs and minimizing undesired waterbed amplifications. Numerical

TL;DR: 提出DiD-L轻量级在线学习方法，通过维度分解将高维扰动识别问题分解为多个低维子任务，使用浅层神经网络和自适应律实现实时400Hz运行的无人机姿态控制扰动识别。


<details>

Abstract: This paper introduces a lightweight and interpretable online learning
approach called Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L) for disturbance
identification in quadrotor geometric attitude control. As a module instance of
DiD-L, we propose the Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM). Specifically, to
address underlying underfitting problems, the high-dimensional mapping for
online identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional
submappings (slices). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is
decomposed into a set of simple low-dimensional subtasks addressed by shallow
neural networks and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are
updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without the persistent excitation
(PE) condition. To enhance the interpretability of the proposed approach, we
prove that the state solution of the rotational error dynamics exponentially
converges into an arbitrarily small ball within an almost global attraction
domain, despite time-varying disturbances and inertia uncertainties. This
result is novel as it demonstrates exponential convergence without requiring
pre-training for unseen disturbances and specific knowledge of the model. To
our knowledge in the quadrotor control field, DiD-L is the first online
learning approach that is lightweight enough to run in real-time at 400 Hz on
microcontroller units (MCUs) such as STM32, and has been validated through
real-world experiments.

Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed diagnosis scheme to detect and estimate
actuator and power line faults in DC microgrids subject to unknown power loads
and stochastic noise. To address actuator faults, we design a fault estimation
filter whose parameters are determined through a tractable optimization problem
to achieve fault estimation, decoupling from power line faults, and robustness
against noise. In contrast, the estimation of power line faults poses greater
challenges due to the inherent coupling between fault currents and unknown
power loads, which becomes ill-posed when the underlying system is
insufficiently excited. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
to address this critical yet underexplored issue. Our solution introduces a
novel differentiate-before-estimate strategy. A set of diagnostic rules based
on the temporal characteristics of a constructed residual is developed to
distinguish load changes from line faults. Once a power line fault is detected,
a regularized least-squares method is activated to estimate the fault currents,
for which we further derive an upper bound on the estimation error. Finally,
comprehensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed
methods.

Motivation: 传统电力系统模型采用时间尺度分解方法，忽略多时间尺度动态的同时作用，可能漏掉重要的系统不稳定问题。本文挖战这一传统假设，强调同时考虑多时间尺度动态对系统稳定性分析的重要性。

Method: 使用Hopf分叉理论对电力系统进行多时间尺度稳定性分析，并给出了网格形成和网格跟随反变器的实际案例研究，展示两种技术如何从多时间尺度动态角度相互补充。

Result: 研究发现，如果不同时考虑多个时间尺度的动态，会漏掉重要的系统不稳定问题（如Hopf分叉引发的不稳定）。网格形成和网格跟随反变器在不同时间尺度上具有补充作用。

Conclusion: 电力系统稳定性分析应该同时考虑多个时间尺度的动态作用，而不是传统地分解处理。网格形成和网格跟随反变器技术可以在多时间尺度动态方面相互补充，提高系统稳定性。

Abstract: Real power systems exhibit dynamics that evolve across a wide range of time
scales, from very fast to very slow phenomena. Historically, incorporating
these wide-ranging dynamics into a single model has been impractical. As a
result, power engineers rely on time-scale decomposition to simplify models.
When fast phenomena are evaluated, slow dynamics are neglected (assumed
stable), and vice versa. This paper challenges this paradigm by showing the
importance of assessing power system stability while considering multiple time
scales simultaneously. Using the concept of Hopf bifurcations, it exemplifies
instability issues that would be missed if multi-time-scale dynamics are not
considered. Although this work employs both grid-following and grid-forming
inverter-based resource models, it is not a direct comparison. Instead, it
presents a case study demonstrating how one technology can complement the other
from a multi time-scale dynamics perspective.

Conclusion: 提出的不可预测控制方法能有效抵御恶意推断，在保证控制性能的同时实现输出不可预测性，为线性系统安全控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how to achieve the unpredictability against
malicious inferences for linear systems. The key idea is to add stochastic
control inputs, named as unpredictable control, to make the outputs irregular.
The future outputs thus become unpredictable and the performance of inferences
is degraded. The major challenges lie in: i) how to formulate optimization
problems to obtain an optimal distribution of stochastic input, under unknown
prediction accuracy of the adversary; and ii) how to achieve the trade-off
between the unpredictability and control performance. We first utilize both
variance and confidence probability of prediction error to quantify
unpredictability, then formulate two two-stage stochastic optimization
problems, respectively. Under variance metric, the analytic optimal
distribution of control input is provided. With probability metric, it is a
non-convex optimization problem, thus we present a novel numerical method and
convert the problem into a solvable linear optimization problem. Last, we
quantify the control performance under unpredictable control, and accordingly
design the unpredictable LQR and cooperative control. Simulations demonstrate
the unpredictability of our control algorithm. The obtained optimal
distribution outperforms Gaussian and Laplace distributions commonly used in
differential privacy under proposed metrics.

Abstract: In this paper, we present an extension to the recursive Gaussian Process
(RGP) regression that enables the satisfaction of inequality constraints and is
well suited for a real-time execution in control applications. The soft
inequality constraints are integrated by introducing an additional extended
Kalman Filter (EKF) update step using pseudo-measurements. The sequential
formulation of the algorithm and several developed heuristics ensure both the
performance and a low computational effort of the algorithm. A special focus
lies on an efficient consideration of monotonicity assumptions for GPs in the
form of inequality constraints. The algorithm is statistically validated in
simulations, where the possible advantages in comparison with the standard RGP
algorithm become obvious. The paper is concluded with a successful experimental
validation of the developed algorithm for the monotonicity-preserving learning
of heat transfer values for the control of a vapor compression cycle
evaporator, leveraging a previously published partial input output
linearization (IOL).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学生辍学是全球教育系统的重大挑战，传统机器学习模型在表格数据上已有不错表现，但图神经网络(GNNs)能捕捉学生数据中复杂的关联关系，可能提供更好的预测效果

Method: 将表格学生数据通过聚类算法(K-Means, HDBSCAN)和降维技术(PCA, UMAP)转换为图结构，比较GNN(GCN和GraphSAGE)与传统表格模型(RF, XGBoost, TabNet)在真实学生数据集上的表现

Result: 特定GNN配置(GraphSAGE+PCA-KMeans聚类)表现最佳，相比最强表格基线(XGBoost)在macro F1分数上提升约7个百分点，准确率提升近2个百分点，但其他GNN配置和建图方法未能稳定超越表格模型

Conclusion: GNN在学生辍学预测中具有潜力，但图生成策略和GNN架构选择至关重要，表格数据到图结构的优化转换仍是该领域的重要挑战

Abstract: Student dropout is a significant challenge in educational systems worldwide,
leading to substantial social and economic costs. Predicting students at risk
of dropout allows for timely interventions. While traditional Machine Learning
(ML) models operating on tabular data have shown promise, Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) offer a potential advantage by capturing complex relationships inherent
in student data if structured as graphs. This paper investigates whether
transforming tabular student data into graph structures, primarily using
clustering techniques, enhances dropout prediction accuracy. We compare the
performance of GNNs (a custom Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and GraphSAGE)
on these generated graphs against established tabular models (Random Forest
(RF), XGBoost, and TabNet) using a real-world student dataset. Our experiments
explore various graph construction strategies based on different clustering
algorithms (K-Means, HDBSCAN) and dimensionality reduction techniques
(Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Uniform Manifold Approximation and
Projection (UMAP)). Our findings demonstrate that a specific GNN configuration,
GraphSAGE on a graph derived from PCA-KMeans clustering, achieved superior
performance, notably improving the macro F1-score by approximately 7 percentage
points and accuracy by nearly 2 percentage points over the strongest tabular
baseline (XGBoost). However, other GNN configurations and graph construction
methods did not consistently surpass tabular models, emphasizing the critical
role of the graph generation strategy and GNN architecture selection. This
highlights both the potential of GNNs and the challenges in optimally
transforming tabular data for graph-based learning in this domain.

TL;DR: STAS框架通过时空自适应计算时间设计，解决了SNN视觉Transformer的高延迟和计算开销问题，在降低能耗的同时提高了准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络(SNN)虽然比人工神经网络更节能，但由于多时间步操作特性导致高延迟和计算开销。现有的动态计算方法分散且不统一，自适应计算时间(ACT)原则虽然提供了统一方法的基础，但在SNN视觉Transformer中的应用受到时间相似性前提违反和静态架构不适配的阻碍

Method: 提出STAS框架，共同设计静态架构和动态计算策略：1) 集成脉冲补丁分割(I-SPS)模块建立时间稳定性，创建统一输入表示；2) 自适应脉冲自注意力(A-SSA)模块在空间和时间维度进行二维token剪枝

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet数据集上验证，STAS分别降低能耗45.9%、43.8%和30.1%，同时准确率超过最先进模型

Conclusion: STAS通过协同设计架构和计算策略，成功解决了SNN视觉Transformer的时间相似性问题，实现了显著的能耗降低和性能提升，为SNN的高效部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer energy efficiency over artificial neural
networks (ANNs) but suffer from high latency and computational overhead due to
their multi-timestep operational nature. While various dynamic computation
methods have been developed to mitigate this by targeting spatial, temporal, or
architecture-specific redundancies, they remain fragmented. While the
principles of adaptive computation time (ACT) offer a robust foundation for a
unified approach, its application to SNN-based vision Transformers (ViTs) is
hindered by two core issues: the violation of its temporal similarity
prerequisite and a static architecture fundamentally unsuited for its
principles. To address these challenges, we propose STAS (Spatio-Temporal
Adaptive computation time for Spiking transformers), a framework that
co-designs the static architecture and dynamic computation policy. STAS
introduces an integrated spike patch splitting (I-SPS) module to establish
temporal stability by creating a unified input representation, thereby solving
the architectural problem of temporal dissimilarity. This stability, in turn,
allows our adaptive spiking self-attention (A-SSA) module to perform
two-dimensional token pruning across both spatial and temporal axes.
Implemented on spiking Transformer architectures and validated on CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, STAS reduces energy consumption by up to 45.9%, 43.8%,
and 30.1%, respectively, while simultaneously improving accuracy over SOTA
models.

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合流匹配和检测模型，有效解决了偷猎预测中的不完全检测和数据稀缺问题，为保护干预措施提供了更准确的预测工具。

Abstract: Poaching poses significant threats to wildlife and biodiversity. A valuable
step in reducing poaching is to forecast poacher behavior, which can inform
patrol planning and other conservation interventions. Existing poaching
prediction methods based on linear models or decision trees lack the
expressivity to capture complex, nonlinear spatiotemporal patterns. Recent
advances in generative modeling, particularly flow matching, offer a more
flexible alternative. However, training such models on real-world poaching data
faces two central obstacles: imperfect detection of poaching events and limited
data. To address imperfect detection, we integrate flow matching with an
occupancy-based detection model and train the flow in latent space to infer the
underlying occupancy state. To mitigate data scarcity, we adopt a composite
flow initialized from a linear-model prediction rather than random noise which
is the standard in diffusion models, injecting prior knowledge and improving
generalization. Evaluations on datasets from two national parks in Uganda show
consistent gains in predictive accuracy.

Conclusion: 高斯插值是处理负荷预测稀疏数据的合适选择，LSTM模型为电力负荷预测提供了最佳解决方案

Abstract: Sparsity, defined as the presence of missing or zero values in a dataset,
often poses a major challenge while operating on real-life datasets. Sparsity
in features or target data of the training dataset can be handled using various
interpolation methods, such as linear or polynomial interpolation, spline,
moving average, or can be simply imputed. Interpolation methods usually perform
well with Strict Sense Stationary (SSS) data. In this study, we show that an
approximately 62\% sparse dataset with hourly load data of a power plant can be
utilized for load forecasting assuming the data is Wide Sense Stationary (WSS),
if augmented with Gaussian interpolation. More specifically, we perform
statistical analysis on the data, and train multiple machine learning and deep
learning models on the dataset. By comparing the performance of these models,
we empirically demonstrate that Gaussian interpolation is a suitable option for
dealing with load forecasting problems. Additionally, we demonstrate that Long
Short-term Memory (LSTM)-based neural network model offers the best performance
among a diverse set of classical and neural network-based models.

Abstract: This research proposes a hybrid Machine Learning and metaheuristic mechanism
that is designed to solve Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The main of our
method is an edge solution selector model, which classifies solution edges to
identify prohibited moves during the local search, hence guiding the search
process within metaheuristic baselines. Two learning-based mechanisms are used
to develop the edge selector: a simple tabular binary classifier and a Graph
Neural Network (GNN). The tabular classifier employs Gradient Boosting Trees
and Feedforward Neural Network as the baseline algorithms. Adjustments to the
decision threshold are also applied to handle the class imbalance in the
problem instance. An alternative mechanism employs the GNN to utilize graph
structure for direct solution edge prediction, with the objective of guiding
local search by predicting prohibited moves. These hybrid mechanisms are then
applied in state-fo-the-art metaheuristic baselines. Our method demonstrates
both scalability and generalizability, achieving performance improvements
across different baseline metaheuristics, various problem sizes and variants,
including the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) and CVRP with Time
Windows (CVRPTW). Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets up to 30,000
customer nodes, supported by pair-wise statistical analysis, verify the
observed improvements.

Result: 仅使用1%标注数据时，在UI和UC数据集上分别达到0.91和0.81的F1分数；使用5%标注数据时，分别提升至0.97和0.87，显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: MCLPD框架有效提升了跨数据集泛化能力，大幅降低了对标注数据的依赖，证明了该框架在帕金森病EEG检测中的有效性

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been validated as an effective technique for
detecting Parkinson's disease,particularly in its early stages.However,the high
cost of EEG data annotation often results in limited dataset size and
considerable discrepancies across datasets,including differences in acquisition
protocols and subject demographics,significantly hinder the robustness and
generalizability of models in cross-dataset detection scenarios.To address such
challenges,this paper proposes a semi-supervised learning framework named
MCLPD,which integrates multi-view contrastive pre-training with lightweight
supervised fine-tuning to enhance cross-dataset PD detection performance.During
pre-training,MCLPD uses self-supervised learning on the unlabeled UNM
dataset.To build contrastive pairs,it applies dual augmentations in both time
and frequency domains,which enrich the data and naturally fuse time-frequency
information.In the fine-tuning phase,only a small proportion of labeled data
from another two datasets (UI and UC)is used for supervised
optimization.Experimental results show that MCLPD achieves F1 scores of 0.91 on
UI and 0.81 on UC using only 1%of labeled data,which further improve to 0.97
and 0.87,respectively,when 5%of labeled data is used.Compared to existing
methods,MCLPD substantially improves cross-dataset generalization while
reducing the dependency on labeled data,demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Abstract: Electroencephalography has been established as an effective method for
detecting Parkinson's disease, typically diagnosed early.Current Parkinson's
disease detection methods have shown significant success within individual
datasets, however, the variability in detection methods across different EEG
datasets and the small size of each dataset pose challenges for training a
generalizable model for cross-dataset scenarios. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a GAN-enhanced generalizable model, named GEPD, specifically for
EEG-based cross-dataset classification of Parkinson's disease.First, we design
a generative network that creates fusion EEG data by controlling the
distribution similarity between generated data and real data.In addition, an
EEG signal quality assessment model is designed to ensure the quality of
generated data great.Second, we design a classification network that utilizes a
combination of multiple convolutional neural networks to effectively capture
the time-frequency characteristics of EEG signals, while maintaining a
generalizable structure and ensuring easy convergence.This work is dedicated to
utilizing intelligent methods to study pathological manifestations, aiming to
facilitate the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological diseases.The evaluation
results demonstrate that our model performs comparably to state-of-the-art
models in cross-dataset settings, achieving an accuracy of 84.3% and an
F1-score of 84.0%, showcasing the generalizability of the proposed model.

Motivation: 现有奖励模型难以捕捉用户特定的细微偏好，特别是在数据有限和跨领域场景下，需要开发能够从少量样本中学习个性化偏好的新方法。

Method: 结合合成数据生成和两阶段训练流程（监督微调+强化微调），从1个或几个个人样本中识别和表示个人因素。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发更有效的个性化大语言模型开辟了新途径，解决了有限数据和跨领域泛化的挑战。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs), which are central to existing post-training methods, aim
to align LLM outputs with human values by providing feedback signals during
fine-tuning. However, existing RMs struggle to capture nuanced, user-specific
preferences, especially under limited data and across diverse domains. Thus, we
introduce PersRM-R1, the first reasoning-based reward modeling framework
specifically designed to identify and represent personal factors from only one
or a few personal exemplars. To address challenges including limited data
availability and the requirement for robust generalization, our approach
combines synthetic data generation with a two-stage training pipeline
consisting of supervised fine-tuning followed by reinforcement fine-tuning.
Experimental results demonstrate that PersRM-R1 outperforms existing models of
similar size and matches the performance of much larger models in both accuracy
and generalizability, paving the way for more effective personalized LLMs.

Abstract: This study revisits label smoothing via a form of information bottleneck.
Under the assumption of sufficient model flexibility and no conflicting labels
for the same input, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that the
model output obtained through label smoothing explores the optimal solution of
the information bottleneck. Based on this, label smoothing can be interpreted
as a practical approach to the information bottleneck, enabling simple
implementation. As an information bottleneck method, we experimentally show
that label smoothing also exhibits the property of being insensitive to factors
that do not contain information about the target, or to factors that provide no
additional information about it when conditioned on another variable.

Motivation: 解决传统油气产量预测中样本外鲁棒性不足和不确定性量化不准确的问题，特别是在复杂非正态数据场景下

Method: 集成生产力指数驱动的特征选择和归纳共形预测框架，使用LSTM、BiLSTM、GRU和XGBoost等算法进行多变量时间序列预测

Conclusion: 领域专业知识与先进ML技术结合显著提升油气产量预测的可靠性，为复杂非正态数据的预测不确定性量化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This research introduces a new ML framework designed to enhance the
robustness of out-of-sample hydrocarbon production forecasting, specifically
addressing multivariate time series analysis. The proposed methodology
integrates Productivity Index (PI)-driven feature selection, a concept derived
from reservoir engineering, with Inductive Conformal Prediction (ICP) for
rigorous uncertainty quantification. Utilizing historical data from the Volve
(wells PF14, PF12) and Norne (well E1H) oil fields, this study investigates the
efficacy of various predictive algorithms-namely Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM),
Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and eXtreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) - in forecasting historical oil production rates (OPR_H).
All the models achieved "out-of-sample" production forecasts for an upcoming
future timeframe. Model performance was comprehensively evaluated using
traditional error metrics (e.g., MAE) supplemented by Forecast Bias and
Prediction Direction Accuracy (PDA) to assess bias and trend-capturing
capabilities. The PI-based feature selection effectively reduced input
dimensionality compared to conventional numerical simulation workflows. The
uncertainty quantification was addressed using the ICP framework, a
distribution-free approach that guarantees valid prediction intervals (e.g.,
95% coverage) without reliance on distributional assumptions, offering a
distinct advantage over traditional confidence intervals, particularly for
complex, non-normal data. Results demonstrated the superior performance of the
LSTM model, achieving the lowest MAE on test (19.468) and genuine out-of-sample
forecast data (29.638) for well PF14, with subsequent validation on Norne well
E1H. These findings highlight the significant potential of combining
domain-specific knowledge with advanced ML techniques to improve the
reliability of hydrocarbon production forecasts.

TL;DR: 该论文通过大规模实证研究分析了鲁棒微调中的设计选择对模型泛化能力的影响，发现在大规模数据集上监督预训练的卷积神经网络通常表现最佳，挑战了当前流行的注意力架构和鲁棒预训练表示的优势假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中鲁棒微调的设计选择（如模型架构、预训练表示、优化策略等）如何影响模型对未见扰动的泛化能力仍是一个开放问题，需要系统性的实证研究来指导实践。

Method: 在6个数据集、40种预训练架构、2种专用损失函数和3种适应协议下进行了1,440种训练配置和7,200次鲁棒性测量，涵盖了五种扰动类型，构建了迄今为止最全面的鲁棒微调基准。

Result: 研究发现，尽管基于注意力的架构和鲁棒预训练表示越来越流行，但在大规模数据集上监督预训练的卷积神经网络往往表现最好，这一结果既证实又挑战了先前的设计假设。

Conclusion: 研究为鲁棒微调提供了实用的指导原则，指出了有前景的研究方向，并强调了传统卷积神经网络在特定条件下的持续优势。

Abstract: Deep learning models operating in the image domain are vulnerable to small
input perturbations. For years, robustness to such perturbations was pursued by
training models from scratch (i.e., with random initializations) using
specialized loss objectives. Recently, robust fine-tuning has emerged as a more
efficient alternative: instead of training from scratch, pretrained models are
adapted to maximize predictive performance and robustness. To conduct robust
fine-tuning, practitioners design an optimization strategy that includes the
model update protocol (e.g., full or partial) and the specialized loss
objective. Additional design choices include the architecture type and size,
and the pretrained representation. These design choices affect robust
generalization, which is the model's ability to maintain performance when
exposed to new and unseen perturbations at test time. Understanding how these
design choices influence generalization remains an open question with
significant practical implications. In response, we present an empirical study
spanning 6 datasets, 40 pretrained architectures, 2 specialized losses, and 3
adaptation protocols, yielding 1,440 training configurations and 7,200
robustness measurements across five perturbation types. To our knowledge, this
is the most diverse and comprehensive benchmark of robust fine-tuning to date.
While attention-based architectures and robust pretrained representations are
increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in
a supervised manner on large datasets often perform best. Our analysis both
confirms and challenges prior design assumptions, highlighting promising
research directions and offering practical guidance.

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a popular multimodal task that
aims to accurately detect target objects within a single image based on a given
textual expression. However, due to the limitations of earlier models,
traditional REC benchmarks either rely solely on intra-image cues or lack
sufficiently fine-grained instance annotations, making them inadequate for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, KnowDR-REC,
characterized by three key features: Firstly, it is built upon real-world
knowledge, requiring fine-grained multimodal reasoning across text and image.
Secondly, the dataset includes elaborately constructed negative samples via
fine-grained expression editing, designed to evaluate a model's robustness and
anti-hallucination ability. Lastly, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics
to systematically explore the model's internal reasoning process. We evaluate
16 state-of-the-art multimodal models on KnowDR-REC, with experimental results
showing that existing MLLMs still struggle with knowledge-driven visual
grounding tasks. Furthermore, we observe a decoupling between textual
understanding and visual grounding in MLLMs, where many models are
significantly influenced by memorized shortcut correlations, which severely
affect their behavior on our benchmark and hinder genuine multimodal reasoning.
We anticipate that the proposed benchmark will inspire future research towards
developing more robust, interpretable, and knowledge-intensive visual grounding
frameworks, driving the development of more reliable and robust multimodal
systems for complex real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种睡眠式回放巩固(SRC)算法，用于解决基于平衡传播训练的循环神经网络在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于平衡传播训练的循环神经网络在持续学习中面临灾难性遗忘问题，而人脑通过睡眠中的记忆回放巩固机制能够有效保留和整合新旧知识，这启发了将类似机制引入人工神经网络的研究。

Method: 提出了睡眠式回放巩固(SRC)算法，在每次新任务训练后实施，通过回放已学习信息来巩固记忆。还将SRC与排练(清醒回放)技术相结合。

Conclusion: 研究表明睡眠式回放技术适用于循环神经网络，为将类人学习行为整合到人工神经网络中展现了巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained using Equilibrium Propagation (EP),
a biologically plausible training algorithm, have demonstrated strong
performance in various tasks such as image classification and reinforcement
learning. However, these networks face a critical challenge in continuous
learning: catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is
overwritten when new tasks are learned. This limitation contrasts with the
human brain's ability to retain and integrate both old and new knowledge, aided
by processes like memory consolidation during sleep through the replay of
learned information. To address this challenge in RNNs, here we propose a
sleep-like replay consolidation (SRC) algorithm for EP-trained RNNs. We found
that SRC significantly improves RNN's resilience to catastrophic forgetting in
continuous learning scenarios. In class-incremental learning with SRC
implemented after each new task training, the EP-trained multilayer RNN model
(MRNN-EP) performed significantly better compared to feedforward networks
incorporating several well-established regularization techniques. The MRNN-EP
performed on par with MRNN trained using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
when both were equipped with SRC on MNIST data and surpassed BPTT-based models
on the Fashion MNIST, Kuzushiji-MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.
Combining SRC with rehearsal, also known as "awake replay", further boosted the
network's ability to retain long-term knowledge while continuing to learn new
tasks. Our study reveals the applicability of sleep-like replay techniques to
RNNs and highlights the potential for integrating human-like learning behaviors
into artificial neural networks (ANNs).

Result: 在多个领域数据集上的实验表明DRILL具有强泛化能力，优于竞争方法

Conclusion: DRILL框架通过离散化处理和分布对齐策略有效解决了半监督回归中的过拟合和伪标签质量问题

Abstract: Semi-supervised regression (SSR), which aims to predict continuous scores of
samples while reducing reliance on a large amount of labeled data, has recently
received considerable attention across various applications, including computer
vision, natural language processing, and audio and medical analysis. Existing
semi-supervised methods typically apply consistency regularization on the
general regression task by generating pseudo-labels. However, these methods
heavily rely on the quality of pseudo-labels, and direct regression fails to
learn the label distribution and can easily lead to overfitting. To address
these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end Decoupled Representation
distillation framework (DRILL) which is specially designed for the
semi-supervised regression task where we transform the general regression task
into a Discrete Distribution Estimation (DDE) task over multiple buckets to
better capture the underlying label distribution and mitigate the risk of
overfitting associated with direct regression. Then we employ the Decoupled
Distribution Alignment (DDA) to align the target bucket and non-target bucket
between teacher and student on the distribution of buckets, encouraging the
student to learn more robust and generalized knowledge from the teacher.
Extensive experiments conducted on datasets from diverse domains demonstrate
that the proposed DRILL has strong generalization and outperforms the competing
methods.

Conclusion: 提出的对比自学习框架能够有效利用未标注时空数据，通过预训练和微调相结合的方式，显著提升了POI人群流量推断的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate acquisition of crowd flow at Points of Interest (POIs) is pivotal
for effective traffic management, public service, and urban planning. Despite
this importance, due to the limitations of urban sensing techniques, the data
quality from most sources is inadequate for monitoring crowd flow at each POI.
This renders the inference of accurate crowd flow from low-quality data a
critical and challenging task. The complexity is heightened by three key
factors: 1) \emph{The scarcity and rarity of labeled data}, 2) \emph{The
intricate spatio-temporal dependencies among POIs}, and 3) \emph{The myriad
correlations between precise crowd flow and GPS reports}.
  To address these challenges, we recast the crowd flow inference problem as a
self-supervised attributed graph representation learning task and introduce a
novel \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{S}elf-learning framework for
\underline{S}patio-\underline{T}emporal data (\model). Our approach initiates
with the construction of a spatial adjacency graph founded on the POIs and
their respective distances. We then employ a contrastive learning technique to
exploit large volumes of unlabeled spatio-temporal data. We adopt a swapped
prediction approach to anticipate the representation of the target subgraph
from similar instances. Following the pre-training phase, the model is
fine-tuned with accurate crowd flow data. Our experiments, conducted on two
real-world datasets, demonstrate that the \model pre-trained on extensive noisy
data consistently outperforms models trained from scratch.

Conclusion: 该研究为理解信任区域优化方法在形态学泛化场景中的行为提供了理论基础和实证证据。

Abstract: Trust region-based optimization methods have become foundational
reinforcement learning algorithms that offer stability and strong empirical
performance in continuous control tasks. Growing interest in scalable and
reusable control policies translate also in a demand for morphological
generalization, the ability of control policies to cope with different
kinematic structures. Graph-based policy architectures provide a natural and
effective mechanism to encode such structural differences. However, while these
architectures accommodate variable morphologies, the behavior of trust region
methods under varying action space dimensionality remains poorly understood. To
this end, we conduct a theoretical analysis of trust region-based policy
optimization methods, focusing on both Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO)
and its widely used first-order approximation, Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO). The goal is to demonstrate how varying action space dimensionality
influence the optimization landscape, particularly under the constraints
imposed by KL-divergence or policy clipping penalties. Complementing the
theoretical insights, an empirical evaluation under morphological variation is
carried out using the Gymnasium Swimmer environment. This benchmark offers a
systematically controlled setting for varying the kinematic structure without
altering the underlying task, making it particularly well-suited to study
morphological generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一个可扩展的参数感知稀疏回归框架，用于从多参数模拟数据中发现可解释的偏微分方程和亚网格尺度闭合模型。该方法基于SINDy，通过四项创新解决了关键限制，并在过滤Burgers数据集上成功发现了Smagorinsky型闭合结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多参数模拟数据和发现亚网格尺度闭合模型时存在局限性，需要开发一个能够统一处理变化物理参数、保证单位一致性、支持批量处理并提供稳健模型识别的框架。

Method: 基于SINDy的稀疏回归框架，包含四个创新：符号参数化使物理参数在统一回归中变化；维度相似性过滤器确保单位一致性并减少候选库；内存高效的Gram矩阵积累支持批量处理；集成共识和系数稳定性分析实现稳健模型识别。

Result: 在一维基准测试中可靠地恢复了控制方程。在过滤Burgers数据集上发现了SGS闭合模型τ_SGS = 0.1603·Δ²(∂ū/∂x)²，对应Smagorinsky常数约0.4004。模型在所有过滤尺度上达到R² = 0.886，相比经典闭合模型具有更好的预测精度。

Conclusion: 该框架能够从数据中自主发现物理上有意义的SGS形式并校准系数，为现有湍流建模方法提供了补充方法，推动了数据驱动闭合发现领域的发展。

Abstract: We present a scalable, parameter-aware sparse regression framework for
discovering interpretable partial differential equations and subgrid-scale
closures from multi-parameter simulation data. Building on SINDy (Sparse
Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics), our approach addresses key limitations
through four innovations: symbolic parameterisation enabling physical
parameters to vary within unified regression; Dimensional Similarity Filter
enforcing unit-consistency whilst reducing candidate libraries;
memory-efficient Gram-matrix accumulation enabling batch processing; and
ensemble consensus with coefficient stability analysis for robust model
identification.
  Validation on canonical one-dimensional benchmarks demonstrates reliable
recovery of governing equations across parameter ranges. Applied to filtered
Burgers datasets, the framework discovers an SGS closure $\tau_{\mathrm{SGS}} =
0.1603\cdot\Delta^2\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^2$,
corresponding to a Smagorinsky constant of approximately 0.4004. This
represents autonomous discovery of Smagorinsky-type closure structure from data
without prior theoretical assumptions.
  The discovered model achieves $R^2 = 0.886$ across filter scales and
demonstrates improved prediction accuracy compared to classical closures. The
framework's ability to identify physically meaningful SGS forms and calibrate
coefficients offers a complementary approach to existing turbulence modelling
methods, contributing to the growing field of data-driven closure discovery.

meaningful representations from raw EEG signals remains challenging due to
limited annotations and high signal variability. Recently, EEG foundation
models (FMs) have shown promising potential by adopting transformer
architectures and self-supervised pre-training methods from large language
models (e.g., masked prediction) to learn representations from diverse EEG
data, followed by fine-tuning on specific EEG tasks. Nonetheless, these large
models often incurred high computational costs during both training and
inference, with only marginal performance improvements as model size increases.
In this work, we proposed EEG representation learning framework building upon
Generative Diffusion Model (EEGDM). Specifically, we developed structured
state-space model for diffusion pretraining (SSMDP) to better capture the
temporal dynamics of EEG signals and trained the architecture using a Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Model. The resulting latent EEG representations were
then used for downstream classification tasks via our proposed latent fusion
transformer (LFT). To evaluate our method, we used the multi-event Temple
University EEG Event Corpus and compared EEGDM with current state-of-the-art
approaches, including EEG FMs. Empirical results showed that our method
outperformed existing methods while being approximately 19x more lightweight.
These findings suggested that EEGDM offered a promising alternative to current
FMs. Our code is available at: https://github.com/jhpuah/EEGDM.

Abstract: This contribution addresses vessel trajectory prediction (VTP), focusing on
the evaluation of different deep learning-based approaches. The objective is to
assess model performance in diverse traffic complexities and compare the
reliability of the approaches. While previous VTP models overlook the specific
traffic situation complexity and lack reliability assessments, this research
uses a probability of detection analysis to quantify model reliability in
varying traffic scenarios, thus going beyond common error distribution
analyses. All models are evaluated on test samples categorized according to
their traffic situation during the prediction horizon, with performance metrics
and reliability estimates obtained for each category. The results of this
comprehensive evaluation provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and
weaknesses of the different prediction approaches, along with their reliability
in terms of the prediction horizon lengths for which safe forecasts can be
guaranteed. These findings can inform the development of more reliable vessel
trajectory prediction approaches, enhancing safety and efficiency in future
inland waterways navigation.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling
large, generalizable models trained through self-supervision. This paradigm has
inspired the development of scientific foundation models (FMs). However,
applying this capability to experimental particle physics is challenging due to
the sparse, spatially distributed nature of detector data, which differs
dramatically from natural language. This work addresses if an FM for particle
physics can scale and generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce a new
dataset with more than 11 million particle collision events and a suite of
downstream tasks and labeled data for evaluation. We propose a novel
self-supervised training method for detector data and demonstrate its neural
scalability with models that feature up to 188 million parameters. With frozen
weights and task-specific adapters, this FM consistently outperforms baseline
models across all downstream tasks. The performance also exhibits robust
data-efficient adaptation. Further analysis reveals that the representations
extracted by the FM are task-agnostic but can be specialized via a single
linear mapping for different downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有的事件响应决策支持框架需要详细的系统模型，限制了实际应用。需要一种能够在模型不准确情况下进行有效决策的方法。

Method: 通过贝叶斯学习迭代优化模型猜想，将推测模型量化为有限马尔可夫模型，利用动态规划进行高效的在线响应规划。

Result: 在CAGE-2基准测试中，MOBAL在适应性和模型不准确鲁棒性方面优于现有技术。

Conclusion: MOBAL方法通过在线贝叶斯学习和模型量化，有效解决了网络事件响应中的模型不准确问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Effective responses to cyberattacks require fast decisions, even when
information about the attack is incomplete or inaccurate. However, most
decision-support frameworks for incident response rely on a detailed system
model that describes the incident, which restricts their practical utility. In
this paper, we address this limitation and present an online method for
incident response planning under model misspecification, which we call MOBAL:
Misspecified Online Bayesian Learning. MOBAL iteratively refines a conjecture
about the model through Bayesian learning as new information becomes available,
which facilitates model adaptation as the incident unfolds. To determine
effective responses online, we quantize the conjectured model into a finite
Markov model, which enables efficient response planning through dynamic
programming. We prove that Bayesian learning is asymptotically consistent with
respect to the information feedback. Additionally, we establish bounds on
misspecification and quantization errors. Experiments on the CAGE-2 benchmark
show that MOBAL outperforms the state of the art in terms of adaptability and
robustness to model misspecification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoBAD是一个用于检测人类移动集体异常的无监督学习模型，通过两阶段注意力机制和预训练任务，能够有效识别意外共现异常和缺席异常，在多个指标上显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测方法主要关注个体移动模式，而集体异常检测需要建模个体间的时空依赖关系，这是一个未被充分探索的挑战。现有方法往往忽视缺席异常这类重要异常类型。

Method: 提出CoBAD模型，使用集体事件序列(CES)和共现事件图表示问题，采用两阶段注意力机制分别建模个体移动模式和个体间交互。通过掩码事件和链接重建任务在大规模集体行为数据上进行预训练。

Result: 在大规模移动数据集上的实验表明，CoBAD显著优于现有异常检测基线方法，AUCROC提升13%-18%，AUCPR提升19%-70%。

Conclusion: CoBAD成功解决了集体移动行为异常检测问题，特别是能够检测被先前工作忽视的缺席异常，为公共安全和城市规划等应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in human mobility is essential for applications such as
public safety and urban planning. While traditional anomaly detection methods
primarily focus on individual movement patterns (e.g., a child should stay at
home at night), collective anomaly detection aims to identify irregularities in
collective mobility behaviors across individuals (e.g., a child is at home
alone while the parents are elsewhere) and remains an underexplored challenge.
Unlike individual anomalies, collective anomalies require modeling
spatiotemporal dependencies between individuals, introducing additional
complexity. To address this gap, we propose CoBAD, a novel model designed to
capture Collective Behaviors for human mobility Anomaly Detection. We first
formulate the problem as unsupervised learning over Collective Event Sequences
(CES) with a co-occurrence event graph, where CES represents the event
sequences of related individuals. CoBAD then employs a two-stage attention
mechanism to model both the individual mobility patterns and the interactions
across multiple individuals. Pre-trained on large-scale collective behavior
data through masked event and link reconstruction tasks, CoBAD is able to
detect two types of collective anomalies: unexpected co-occurrence anomalies
and absence anomalies, the latter of which has been largely overlooked in prior
work. Extensive experiments on large-scale mobility datasets demonstrate that
CoBAD significantly outperforms existing anomaly detection baselines, achieving
an improvement of 13%-18% in AUCROC and 19%-70% in AUCPR. All source code is

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种从具有评分函数的图神经网络中提取可解释Datalog规则的方法，通过使GNN和评分函数单调化来确保规则提取的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN可解释性方法主要针对低表达能力图编码/解码方法，无法处理使用评分函数进行链接预测的通用方法，需要开发新的可解释性技术。

Method: 使GNN和评分函数单调化，利用单调性提取可靠的解释规则，并为特定类别的单调GNN定义等价Datalog程序生成过程。

Result: 实验表明，单调GNN和评分函数在实际链接预测基准上表现良好，并能产生大量可靠的规则。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩展了GNN可解释性技术，能够处理更通用的链接预测方法，为理解GNN决策提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are often used for the task of link prediction:
predicting missing binary facts in knowledge graphs (KGs). To address the lack
of explainability of GNNs on KGs, recent works extract Datalog rules from GNNs
with provable correspondence guarantees. The extracted rules can be used to
explain the GNN's predictions; furthermore, they can help characterise the
expressive power of various GNN models. However, these works address only a
form of link prediction based on a restricted, low-expressivity graph
encoding/decoding method. In this paper, we consider a more general and popular
approach for link prediction where a scoring function is used to decode the GNN
output into fact predictions. We show how GNNs and scoring functions can be
adapted to be monotonic, use the monotonicity to extract sound rules for
explaining predictions, and leverage existing results about the kind of rules
that scoring functions can capture. We also define procedures for obtaining
equivalent Datalog programs for certain classes of monotonic GNNs with scoring
functions. Our experiments show that, on link prediction benchmarks, monotonic
GNNs and scoring functions perform well in practice and yield many sound rules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励机(RMs)为强化学习提供了结构化方式来指定非马尔可夫奖励，但需要进一步改进以更好地表达复杂学习目标并提高学习效率。

Method: 引入物理信息奖励机(pRMs)，开发能够利用pRMs的强化学习算法，通过反事实经验生成和奖励塑形技术来加速学习过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，在有限和连续物理环境中，使用pRMs的技术显著加速了训练阶段的奖励获取，提高了多个控制任务的学习效率。

Conclusion: 物理信息奖励机(pRMs)提供了更可编程、表达力更强且更高效的强化学习方法，通过将环境知识与采样发现分离，有效降低了样本复杂度并加速了学习过程。

Abstract: Reward machines (RMs) provide a structured way to specify non-Markovian
rewards in reinforcement learning (RL), thereby improving both expressiveness
and programmability. Viewed more broadly, they separate what is known about the
environment, captured by the reward mechanism, from what remains unknown and
must be discovered through sampling. This separation supports techniques such
as counterfactual experience generation and reward shaping, which reduce sample
complexity and speed up learning. We introduce physics-informed reward machines
(pRMs), a symbolic machine designed to express complex learning objectives and
reward structures for RL agents, thereby enabling more programmable,
expressive, and efficient learning. We present RL algorithms capable of
exploiting pRMs via counterfactual experiences and reward shaping. Our
experimental results show that these techniques accelerate reward acquisition
during the training phases of RL. We demonstrate the expressiveness and
effectiveness of pRMs through experiments in both finite and continuous
physical environments, illustrating that incorporating pRMs significantly
improves learning efficiency across several control tasks.

Motivation: 收集高质量训练样本成本高昂，预算有限时如何选择样本难度（简单、中等、困难、随机）以获得最佳微调效果

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)在不同模型规模和系列上进行微调，通过基础模型的多样本评估获取难度估计，比较四种子集选择策略

Result: 训练最难样本获得最大性能提升（高达47%），简单样本提升最小。困难样本在GRPO训练中提供更多可学习机会

Conclusion: 预算受限的后训练中应优先选择困难样本，使用GRPO在推理任务上可获得显著性能提升

Abstract: Collecting high-quality training examples for language model fine-tuning is
expensive, with practical budgets limiting the amount of data that can be
procured. We investigate a critical question for resource-constrained
alignment: under a fixed acquisition budget, should practitioners prioritize
examples that are easy, medium, hard, or of random difficulty? We study Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tuning across different model sizes
and families, comparing four subset selection policies chosen from the same
unlabeled pool using base-model difficulty estimates obtained via multi-sample
evaluation. Our experiments reveal that training on the hardest examples yields
the largest performance gains, up to 47%, while training on easy examples yield
the smallest gains. Analysis reveals that this effect arises from harder
examples providing more learnable opportunities during GRPO training. These
findings provide practical guidance for budget-constrained post-training:
prioritizing hard examples yields substantial performance gains on reasoning
tasks when using GRPO.

Abstract: Hypergraphs offer a generalized framework for capturing high-order
relationships between entities and have been widely applied in various domains,
including healthcare, social networks, and bioinformatics. Hypergraph neural
networks, which rely on message-passing between nodes over hyperedges to learn
latent representations, have emerged as the method of choice for predictive
tasks in many of these domains. These approaches typically perform only a small
number of message-passing rounds to learn the representations, which they then
utilize for predictions. The small number of message-passing rounds comes at a
cost, as the representations only capture local information and forego
long-range high-order dependencies. However, as we demonstrate, blindly
increasing the message-passing rounds to capture long-range dependency also
degrades the performance of hyper-graph neural networks.
  Recent works have demonstrated that implicit graph neural networks capture
long-range dependencies in standard graphs while maintaining performance.
Despite their popularity, prior work has not studied long-range dependency
issues on hypergraph neural networks. Here, we first demonstrate that existing
hypergraph neural networks lose predictive power when aggregating more
information to capture long-range dependency. We then propose Implicit
Hypergraph Neural Network (IHNN), a novel framework that jointly learns
fixed-point representations for both nodes and hyperedges in an end-to-end
manner to alleviate this issue. Leveraging implicit differentiation, we
introduce a tractable projected gradient descent approach to train the model
efficiently. Extensive experiments on real-world hypergraphs for node
classification demonstrate that IHNN outperforms the closest prior works in
most settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art in hypergraph learning.

Abstract: As urban populations continue to grow, cities face numerous challenges in
managing parking and determining occupancy. This issue is particularly
pronounced in university campuses, where students need to find vacant parking
spots quickly and conveniently during class timings. The limited availability
of parking spaces on campuses underscores the necessity of implementing
efficient systems to allocate vacant parking spots effectively. We propose a
smart framework that integrates multiple data sources, including street maps,
mobility, and meteorological data, through a spatial join operation to capture
parking behavior and vehicle movement patterns over the span of 3 consecutive
days with an hourly duration between 7AM till 3PM. The system will not require
any sensing tools to be installed in the street or in the parking area to
provide its services since all the data needed will be collected using location
services. The framework will use the expected parking entrance and time to
specify a suitable parking area. Several forecasting models, namely, Linear
Regression, Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest Regression (RFR),
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are evaluated. Hyperparameter tuning was
employed using grid search, and model performance is assessed using Root Mean
Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Coefficient of
Determination (R2). Random Forest Regression achieved the lowest RMSE of 0.142
and highest R2 of 0.582. However, given the time-series nature of the task, an
LSTM model may perform better with additional data and longer timesteps.

Conclusion: 该研究展示了结合物理信息数据、机器学习模型和优化算法的实用方法，可用于数据有限的其他材料设计场景，实验数据提高了预测可靠性。

Abstract: Designing shape memory alloys (SMAs) that meet performance targets while
remaining affordable and sustainable is a complex challenge. In this work, we
focus on optimizing SMA compositions to achieve a desired martensitic start
temperature (Ms) while minimizing cost. To do this, we use machine learning
models as surrogate predictors and apply numerical optimization methods to
search for suitable alloy combinations. We trained two types of machine
learning models, a tree-based ensemble and a neural network, using a dataset of
experimentally characterized alloys and physics-informed features. The
tree-based model was used with a derivative-free optimizer (COBYLA), while the
neural network, which provides gradient information, was paired with a
gradient-based optimizer (TRUST-CONSTR). Our results show that while both
models predict Ms with similar accuracy, the optimizer paired with the neural
network finds better solutions more consistently. COBYLA often converged to
suboptimal results, especially when the starting guess was far from the target.
The TRUST-CONSTR method showed more stable behavior and was better at reaching
alloy compositions that met both objectives. This study demonstrates a
practical approach to exploring new SMA compositions by combining
physics-informed data, machine learning models, and optimization algorithms.
Although the scale of our dataset is smaller than simulation-based efforts, the
use of experimental data improves the reliability of the predictions. The
approach can be extended to other materials where design trade-offs must be
made with limited data.

TL;DR: ERIS是一个用于时间序列分类的端到端框架，通过能量正则化信息实现引导式特征解耦，提高模型在分布外数据上的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列分类模型在处理分布外数据时存在性能下降问题，主要原因是模型将领域特定特征和标签相关特征纠缠在一起，形成伪相关性。现有的特征解耦方法缺乏语义引导，无法有效分离真正通用的特征。

Method: ERIS框架包含三个核心机制：1）能量引导校准机制，提供语义指导使模型自校准；2）权重级正交性策略，强制领域特定特征和标签相关特征的结构独立性；3）辅助对抗训练机制，通过注入结构化扰动增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，ERIS相比最先进的基线方法平均准确率提升了4.04%。

Conclusion: ERIS通过结合数学约束和语义指导，实现了有效的特征解耦，显著提高了时间序列分类模型在分布外数据上的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: An ideal time series classification (TSC) should be able to capture invariant
representations, but achieving reliable performance on out-of-distribution
(OOD) data remains a core obstacle. This obstacle arises from the way models
inherently entangle domain-specific and label-relevant features, resulting in
spurious correlations. While feature disentanglement aims to solve this,
current methods are largely unguided, lacking the semantic direction required
to isolate truly universal features. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
Energy-Regularized Information for Shift-Robustness (\textbf{ERIS}) framework
to enable guided and reliable feature disentanglement. The core idea is that
effective disentanglement requires not only mathematical constraints but also
semantic guidance to anchor the separation process. ERIS incorporates three key
mechanisms to achieve this goal. Specifically, we first introduce an
energy-guided calibration mechanism, which provides crucial semantic guidance
for the separation, enabling the model to self-calibrate. Additionally, a
weight-level orthogonality strategy enforces structural independence between
domain-specific and label-relevant features, thereby mitigating their
interference. Moreover, an auxiliary adversarial training mechanism enhances
robustness by injecting structured perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that
ERIS improves upon state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 4.04% accuracy
across four benchmarks.

Abstract: Modal testing plays a critical role in structural analysis by providing
essential insights into dynamic behaviour across a wide range of engineering
industries. In practice, designing an effective modal test campaign involves
complex experimental planning, comprising a series of interdependent decisions
that significantly influence the final test outcome. Traditional approaches to
test design are typically static-focusing only on global tests without
accounting for evolving test campaign parameters or the impact of such changes
on previously established decisions, such as sensor configurations, which have
been found to significantly influence test outcomes. These rigid methodologies
often compromise test accuracy and adaptability. To address these limitations,
this study introduces an agent-based decision support framework for adaptive
sensor placement across dynamically changing modal test environments. The
framework formulates the problem using an underspecified partially observable
Markov decision process, enabling the training of a generalist reinforcement
learning agent through a dual-curriculum learning strategy. A detailed case
study on a steel cantilever structure demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed
method in optimising sensor locations across frequency segments, validating its
robustness and real-world applicability in experimental settings.

TL;DR: 提出基于元学习的框架，利用多城市数据训练模型来估计交通网络宏观基本图，解决检测器数据不足的问题，显著提升流量预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统宏观基本图估计需要大量环线检测器数据，但实际应用中往往数据稀缺。需要一种能够跨城市通用、适应不同检测器配置和拓扑结构的方法。

Method: 开发基于元学习的多任务物理信息神经网络框架，利用多个城市的数据进行训练，能够自适应地估计不同城市的宏观基本图。

Conclusion: 元学习框架有效解决了检测器数据稀缺问题，相比传统迁移学习方法表现更好，展示了在有限检测器条件下的应用潜力。

Abstract: The Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram is a popular tool used to describe
traffic dynamics in an aggregated way, with applications ranging from traffic
control to incident analysis. However, estimating the MFD for a given network
requires large numbers of loop detectors, which is not always available in
practice. This article proposes a framework harnessing meta-learning, a
subcategory of machine learning that trains models to understand and adapt to
new tasks on their own, to alleviate the data scarcity challenge. The developed
model is trained and tested by leveraging data from multiple cities and
exploiting it to model the MFD of other cities with different shares of
detectors and topological structures. The proposed meta-learning framework is
applied to an ad-hoc Multi-Task Physics-Informed Neural Network, specifically
designed to estimate the MFD. Results show an average MSE improvement in flow
prediction ranging between ~ 17500 and 36000 (depending on the subset of loop
detectors tested). The meta-learning framework thus successfully generalizes
across diverse urban settings and improves performance on cities with limited
data, demonstrating the potential of using meta-learning when a limited number
of detectors is available. Finally, the proposed framework is validated against
traditional transfer learning approaches and tested with FitFun, a
non-parametric model from the literature, to prove its transferability.

Conclusion: 这是首个将生物观测到的功能连接模式作为结构偏置融入ANN设计的架构，证明了生物启发式稀疏连接在提升计算效率和性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: The structure of biological neural circuits-modular, hierarchical, and
sparsely interconnected-reflects an efficient trade-off between wiring cost,
functional specialization, and robustness. These principles offer valuable
insights for artificial neural network (ANN) design, especially as networks
grow in depth and scale. Sparsity, in particular, has been widely explored for
reducing memory and computation, improving speed, and enhancing generalization.
Motivated by systems neuroscience findings, we explore how patterns of
functional connectivity in the mouse visual cortex-specifically,
ensemble-to-ensemble communication, can inform ANN design. We introduce G2GNet,
a novel architecture that imposes sparse, modular connectivity across
feedforward layers. Despite having significantly fewer parameters than fully
connected models, G2GNet achieves superior accuracy on standard vision
benchmarks. To our knowledge, this is the first architecture to incorporate
biologically observed functional connectivity patterns as a structural bias in
ANN design. We complement this static bias with a dynamic sparse training (DST)
mechanism that prunes and regrows edges during training. We also propose a
Hebbian-inspired rewiring rule based on activation correlations, drawing on
principles of biological plasticity. G2GNet achieves up to 75% sparsity while
improving accuracy by up to 4.3% on benchmarks, including Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, outperforming dense baselines with far fewer
computations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了记忆摊销推理（MAI）框架，将认知建模为在记忆潜在循环上的推理而非梯度下降重计算，通过结构重用实现熵最小化和上下文感知推理，为通用智能提供了统一的理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能本质上是非遍历的，不是通过均匀采样或从零优化产生，而是通过先前推理轨迹的结构化重用。当前AI面临计算瓶颈，需要更高效的能量推理方法。

Method: 引入记忆摊销推理（MAI）框架，将认知建模为在记忆潜在循环上的推理，使用delta同调理论分析，将每个皮质柱建模为在循环一致记忆状态上的局部推理算子。

Result: 建立了MAI与强化学习的时间反转对偶性：RL从奖励向前传播价值，MAI从记忆向后重建潜在原因。这为能量高效推理提供了路径。

Conclusion: MAI提供了一个基于结构、重用和记忆的统一生物学基础智能理论，为实现人工通用智能（AGI）提供了深刻启示，解决了现代AI面临的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Intelligence is fundamentally non-ergodic: it emerges not from uniform
sampling or optimization from scratch, but from the structured reuse of prior
inference trajectories. We introduce Memory-Amortized Inference (MAI) as a
formal framework in which cognition is modeled as inference over latent cycles
in memory, rather than recomputation through gradient descent. MAI systems
encode inductive biases via structural reuse, minimizing entropy and enabling
context-aware, structure-preserving inference. This approach reframes cognitive
systems not as ergodic samplers, but as navigators over constrained latent
manifolds, guided by persistent topological memory. Through the lens of
delta-homology, we show that MAI provides a principled foundation for
Mountcastle's Universal Cortical Algorithm, modeling each cortical column as a
local inference operator over cycle-consistent memory states. Furthermore, we
establish a time-reversal duality between MAI and reinforcement learning:
whereas RL propagates value forward from reward, MAI reconstructs latent causes
backward from memory. This inversion paves a path toward energy-efficient
inference and addresses the computational bottlenecks facing modern AI. MAI
thus offers a unified, biologically grounded theory of intelligence based on
structure, reuse, and memory. We also briefly discuss the profound implications
of MAI for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Conclusion: GraphCBMs通过建模概念间关系，有效提升了概念瓶颈模型的性能，同时保持了模型的可解释性和干预能力，为构建更强大的可解释AI系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide explicit interpretations for deep
neural networks through concepts and allow intervention with concepts to adjust
final predictions. Existing CBMs assume concepts are conditionally independent
given labels and isolated from each other, ignoring the hidden relationships
among concepts. However, the set of concepts in CBMs often has an intrinsic
structure where concepts are generally correlated: changing one concept will
inherently impact its related concepts. To mitigate this limitation, we propose
GraphCBMs: a new variant of CBM that facilitates concept relationships by
constructing latent concept graphs, which can be combined with CBMs to enhance
model performance while retaining their interpretability. Our experiment
results on real-world image classification tasks demonstrate Graph CBMs offer
the following benefits: (1) superior in image classification tasks while
providing more concept structure information for interpretability; (2) able to
utilize latent concept graphs for more effective interventions; and (3) robust
in performance across different training and architecture settings.

TL;DR: ABMLL是一种针对LoRA微调的高效贝叶斯元学习方法，通过摊销技术提高大语言模型的泛化能力和不确定性量化，在计算效率和性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA微调方法在泛化能力方面存在不足，而改进方法如上下文提示优化和元学习往往计算和内存开销巨大，需要解决这些效率问题。

Method: 基于摊销贝叶斯元学习框架，重新定义LoRA中的任务特定参数和全局参数，引入新超参数平衡重构精度和参数保真度，保持计算高效性。

Result: 在Unified-QA和CrossFit数据集上测试，ABMLL在准确率和预期校准误差方面均优于现有方法，可扩展到Llama3-8B等大模型。

Conclusion: ABMLL成功将贝叶斯元学习适配到大语言模型的LoRA微调中，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了泛化性能和不确定性量化能力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with low-rank adaptaion (LoRA) is a
cost-effective way to incorporate information from a specific dataset. However,
it is often unclear how well the fine-tuned LLM will generalize, i.e., how well
it will perform on unseen datasets. Methods have been proposed to improve
generalization by optimizing with in-context prompts, or by using meta-learning
to fine-tune LLMs. However, these methods are expensive in memory and
computation, requiring either long-context prompts or saving copies of
parameters and using second-order gradient updates. To address these
challenges, we propose Amortized Bayesian Meta-Learning for LoRA (ABMLL). This
method builds on amortized Bayesian meta-learning for smaller models, adapting
this approach to LLMs while maintaining its computational efficiency. We
reframe task-specific and global parameters in the context of LoRA and use a
set of new hyperparameters to balance reconstruction accuracy and the fidelity
of task-specific parameters to the global ones. ABMLL provides effective
generalization and scales to large models such as Llama3-8B. Furthermore, as a
result of using a Bayesian framework, ABMLL provides improved uncertainty
quantification. We test ABMLL on Unified-QA and CrossFit datasets and find that
it outperforms existing methods on these benchmarks in terms of both accuracy
and expected calibration error.

Motivation: 在边缘硬件上部署大语言模型需要动态剪枝来减少计算量，但现有方法要么固定稀疏模式，要么增加运行时开销，零剪枝方法在短提示/长生成场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出A/I-GLASS方法：基于激活和影响的全局-局部神经重要性聚合，使用排名聚合结合提示局部统计和模型固有全局统计来动态选择FFN单元。

Result: 在多个LLM和基准测试中，GLASS显著优于先前的无需训练方法，特别是在具有挑战性的长文本生成场景中，且不依赖辅助预测器或增加推理开销。

Conclusion: GLASS提供了一种有效的训练免费动态剪枝解决方案，能够在保持质量的同时显著减少计算需求，特别适用于边缘设备上的LLM部署。

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge hardware demands aggressive,
prompt-aware dynamic pruning to reduce computation without degrading quality.
Static or predictor-based schemes either lock in a single sparsity pattern or
incur extra runtime overhead, and recent zero-shot methods that rely on
statistics from a single prompt fail on short prompt and/or long generation
scenarios. We introduce A/I-GLASS: Activation- and Impact-based Global-Local
neural importance Aggregation for feed-forward network SparSification, two
training-free methods that dynamically select FFN units using a
rank-aggregation of prompt local and model-intrinsic global neuron statistics.
Empirical results across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that GLASS
significantly outperforms prior training-free methods, particularly in
challenging long-form generation scenarios, without relying on auxiliary
predictors or adding any inference overhead.

TL;DR: AIRL-S统一了强化学习和搜索方法，通过对抗逆强化学习直接从正确推理轨迹学习动态过程奖励模型，无需人工标注，在多个推理任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时缩放方法分为两类：强化学习方法（不稳定、样本效率低）和基于搜索的方法（需要昂贵标注、易受分布偏移影响）。需要一种统一的方法来克服这些局限性。

Method: 使用对抗逆强化学习（AIRL）结合群体相对策略优化（GRPO），直接从正确推理轨迹学习密集动态过程奖励模型，无需标注中间过程数据。推理时该模型同时作为RL评论器和搜索启发式。

Result: 在8个基准测试（数学、科学推理、代码生成）中，平均性能提升9%，达到GPT-4o水平。集成到多种搜索算法中均优于所有基于标注数据的基线PRM。

Conclusion: RL训练的奖励函数本身就是搜索的最佳过程奖励模型，为LLM复杂推理任务提供了鲁棒且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) for large language models (LLMs) has thus far fallen
into two largely separate paradigms: (1) reinforcement learning (RL) methods
that optimize sparse outcome-based rewards, yet suffer from instability and low
sample efficiency; and (2) search-based techniques guided by independently
trained, static process reward models (PRMs), which require expensive human- or
LLM-generated labels and often degrade under distribution shifts. In this
paper, we introduce AIRL-S, the first natural unification of RL-based and
search-based TTS. Central to AIRL-S is the insight that the reward function
learned during RL training inherently represents the ideal PRM for guiding
downstream search. Specifically, we leverage adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL) combined with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to
learn a dense, dynamic PRM directly from correct reasoning traces, entirely
eliminating the need for labeled intermediate process data. At inference, the
resulting PRM simultaneously serves as the critic for RL rollouts and as a
heuristic to effectively guide search procedures, facilitating robust reasoning
chain extension, mitigating reward hacking, and enhancing cross-task
generalization. Experimental results across eight benchmarks, including
mathematics, scientific reasoning, and code generation, demonstrate that our
unified approach improves performance by 9 % on average over the base model,
matching GPT-4o. Furthermore, when integrated into multiple search algorithms,
our PRM consistently outperforms all baseline PRMs trained with labeled data.
These results underscore that, indeed, your reward function for RL is your best
PRM for search, providing a robust and cost-effective solution to complex
reasoning tasks in LLMs.

Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and
tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces
FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors
the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by
assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with
periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance
climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble
(ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under
different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent
baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and
mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to
transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited
for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a
scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for
physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable results in various
real-world applications, including drug discovery, object detection, social
media analysis, recommender systems, and text classification. In contrast to
their vast potential, training them on large-scale graphs presents significant
computational challenges due to the resources required for their storage and
processing. Graph Condensation has emerged as a promising solution to reduce
these demands by learning a synthetic compact graph that preserves the
essential information of the original one while maintaining the GNN's
predictive performance. Despite their efficacy, current graph condensation
approaches frequently rely on a computationally intensive bi-level
optimization. Moreover, they fail to maintain a mapping between synthetic and
original nodes, limiting the interpretability of the model's decisions. In this
sense, a wide range of decomposition techniques have been applied to learn
linear or multi-linear functions from graph data, offering a more transparent
and less resource-intensive alternative. However, their applicability to graph
condensation remains unexplored. This paper addresses this gap and proposes a
novel method called Multi-view Graph Condensation via Tensor Decomposition
(GCTD) to investigate to what extent such techniques can synthesize an
informative smaller graph and achieve comparable downstream task performance.
Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GCTD
effectively reduces graph size while preserving GNN performance, achieving up
to a 4.0\ improvement in accuracy on three out of six datasets and competitive
performance on large graphs compared to existing approaches. Our code is

Abstract: GNSS localization using everyday mobile devices is challenging in urban
environments, as ranging errors caused by the complex propagation of satellite
signals and low-quality onboard GNSS hardware are blamed for undermining
positioning accuracy. Researchers have pinned their hopes on data-driven
methods to regress such ranging errors from raw measurements. However, the
grueling annotation of ranging errors impedes their pace. This paper presents a
robust end-to-end Neural Ranging Correction (NeRC) framework, where
localization-related metrics serve as the task objective for training the
neural modules. Instead of seeking impractical ranging error labels, we train
the neural network using ground-truth locations that are relatively easy to
obtain. This functionality is supported by differentiable moving horizon
location estimation (MHE) that handles a horizon of measurements for
positioning and backpropagates the gradients for training. Even better, as a
blessing of end-to-end learning, we propose a new training paradigm using
Euclidean Distance Field (EDF) cost maps, which alleviates the demands on
labeled locations. We evaluate the proposed NeRC on public benchmarks and our
collected datasets, demonstrating its distinguished improvement in positioning
accuracy. We also deploy NeRC on the edge to verify its real-time performance
for mobile devices.

Abstract: This paper studies the interplay between learning algorithms and graph
structure for graph neural networks (GNNs). Existing theoretical studies on the
learning dynamics of GNNs primarily focus on the convergence rates of learning
algorithms under the interpolation regime (noise-free) and offer only a crude
connection between these dynamics and the actual graph structure (e.g., maximum
degree). This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the excessive risk
(generalization performance) of learning algorithms in GNNs within the
generalization regime (with noise). Specifically, we extend the conventional
settings from the learning theory literature to the context of GNNs and examine
how graph structure influences the performance of learning algorithms such as
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and Ridge regression. Our study makes several
key contributions toward understanding the interplay between graph structure
and learning in GNNs. First, we derive the excess risk profiles of SGD and
Ridge regression in GNNs and connect these profiles to the graph structure
through spectral graph theory. With this established framework, we further
explore how different graph structures (regular vs. power-law) impact the
performance of these algorithms through comparative analysis. Additionally, we
extend our analysis to multi-layer linear GNNs, revealing an increasing
non-isotropic effect on the excess risk profile, thereby offering new insights
into the over-smoothing issue in GNNs from the perspective of learning
algorithms. Our empirical results align with our theoretical predictions,
\emph{collectively showcasing a coupling relation among graph structure, GNNs
and learning algorithms, and providing insights on GNN algorithm design and
selection in practice.}

Abstract: Autonomous Cyber Operations (ACO) rely on Reinforcement Learning (RL) to
train agents to make effective decisions in the cybersecurity domain. However,
existing ACO applications require agents to learn from scratch, leading to slow
convergence and poor early-stage performance. While teacher-guided techniques
have demonstrated promise in other domains, they have not yet been applied to
ACO. In this study, we implement four distinct teacher-guided techniques in the
simulated CybORG environment and conduct a comparative evaluation. Our results
demonstrate that teacher integration can significantly improve training
efficiency in terms of early policy performance and convergence speed,
highlighting its potential benefits for autonomous cybersecurity.

Result: 分析揭示了影响SGGMs收敛界的独特因素（如图结构拓扑特性），提供了超参数选择（采样步数和扩散长度）的理论见解，并验证了归一化等技术对改善收敛的有效性。实证研究结果与理论预测一致。

Conclusion: 本研究深化了对SGGMs的理论理解，证明了其在关键领域的适用性，并为设计有效模型提供了实用指导，填补了图生成模型收敛性理论分析的空白。

Abstract: Score-based graph generative models (SGGMs) have proven effective in critical
applications such as drug discovery and protein synthesis. However, their
theoretical behavior, particularly regarding convergence, remains
underexplored. Unlike common score-based generative models (SGMs), which are
governed by a single stochastic differential equation (SDE), SGGMs involve a
system of coupled SDEs. In SGGMs, the graph structure and node features are
governed by separate but interdependent SDEs. This distinction makes existing
convergence analyses from SGMs inapplicable for SGGMs. In this work, we present
the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for SGGMs, focusing on the
convergence bound (the risk of generative error) across three key graph
generation paradigms: (1) feature generation with a fixed graph structure, (2)
graph structure generation with fixed node features, and (3) joint generation
of both graph structure and node features. Our analysis reveals several unique
factors specific to SGGMs (e.g., the topological properties of the graph
structure) which affect the convergence bound. Additionally, we offer
theoretical insights into the selection of hyperparameters (e.g., sampling
steps and diffusion length) and advocate for techniques like normalization to
improve convergence. To validate our theoretical findings, we conduct a
controlled empirical study using synthetic graph models, and the results align
with our theoretical predictions. This work deepens the theoretical
understanding of SGGMs, demonstrates their applicability in critical domains,
and provides practical guidance for designing effective models.

TL;DR: SBGD模型通过将图表示细化到块图空间，解决了图扩散生成模型在可扩展性和尺寸泛化方面的挑战，显著降低内存需求并提升生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图扩散生成模型(GDGMs)面临内存需求高、难以扩展到大型图，以及尺寸泛化能力差的问题，限制了其在实际大规模图数据中的应用。

Method: 提出随机块图扩散(SBGD)模型，将图表示细化到块图空间，融入基于真实图模式的结构先验，降低内存复杂度并改善尺寸泛化。

Result: SBGD实现了显著的内存改进(最高6倍)，同时保持或超越最先进方法的图生成性能，并能更好地泛化到未见过的图尺寸。

Conclusion: SBGD不仅是一个可扩展且有效的GDGM，还展示了生成建模中的模块化原则，为通过分解复杂任务来探索生成模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: Graph diffusion generative models (GDGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
generating high-quality graphs. However, their broader adoption faces
challenges in \emph{scalability and size generalization}. GDGMs struggle to
scale to large graphs due to their high memory requirements, as they typically
operate in the full graph space, requiring the entire graph to be stored in
memory during training and inference. This constraint limits their feasibility
for large-scale real-world graphs. GDGMs also exhibit poor size generalization,
with limited ability to generate graphs of sizes different from those in the
training data, restricting their adaptability across diverse applications. To
address these challenges, we propose the stochastic block graph diffusion
(SBGD) model, which refines graph representations into a block graph space.
This space incorporates structural priors based on real-world graph patterns,
significantly reducing memory complexity and enabling scalability to large
graphs. The block representation also improves size generalization by capturing
fundamental graph structures. Empirical results show that SBGD achieves
significant memory improvements (up to 6$\times$) while maintaining comparable
or even superior graph generation performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that SBGD better generalizes to
unseen graph sizes. The significance of SBGD extends beyond being a scalable
and effective GDGM; it also exemplifies the principle of modularization in
generative modeling, offering a new avenue for exploring generative models by
decomposing complex tasks into more manageable components.

Motivation: 利用大语言模型的新进展来模拟复杂生理系统，为重症监护提供精确诊断、治疗模拟和假设测试的数字孪生工具。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，每个模拟器针对特定生理系统进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习指导的协调机制进行动态参考选择和错误校正。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled new
possibilities in simulating complex physiological systems. We introduce
Organ-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via
LLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,
cardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on
system-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination
using dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from
7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution
trajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high
simulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and
robustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU
patients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution
shifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical
multi-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with
coherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care
physicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert
ratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations
under alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and
APACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early
warning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops
(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns. These results
position Organ-Agents as a credible, interpretable, and generalizable digital
twin for precision diagnosis, treatment simulation, and hypothesis testing in
critical care.

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了扩散模型需要大量潜在状态/时间步数的假设，通过精心选择噪声调度，证明了用少量（甚至单个）潜在状态就能达到与大量状态相当的性能，并提出了解耦模型实现4-6倍的加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战扩散模型需要大量潜在状态的基本假设，探索用更少的潜在状态达到相同甚至更好的性能，以提高训练效率。

Method: 通过精心选择噪声调度，在少量潜在状态（T∼32）下训练扩散模型，并进一步推进到单个潜在状态的完全解耦，通过组合多个独立训练的单潜在状态模型生成高质量样本。

Result: 实验表明，使用少量潜在状态的模型性能与使用大量潜在状态（T∼1,000）的模型相当，解耦模型在两个不同数据集上实现了4-6倍的加速收敛。

Conclusion: 扩散模型并不需要大量潜在状态，通过合适的噪声调度和模型解耦，可以用更少的计算资源获得相同甚至更好的性能，显著提高训练效率。

Abstract: We challenge a fundamental assumption of diffusion models, namely, that a
large number of latent-states or time-steps is required for training so that
the reverse generative process is close to a Gaussian. We first show that with
careful selection of a noise schedule, diffusion models trained over a small
number of latent states (i.e. $T \sim 32$) match the performance of models
trained over a much large number of latent states ($T \sim 1,000$). Second, we
push this limit (on the minimum number of latent states required) to a single
latent-state, which we refer to as complete disentanglement in T-space. We show
that high quality samples can be easily generated by the disentangled model
obtained by combining several independently trained single latent-state models.
We provide extensive experiments to show that the proposed disentangled model
provides 4-6$\times$ faster convergence measured across a variety of metrics on
two different datasets.

Motivation: 可穿戴传感器数据为个性化健康监测提供了机会，但从其复杂的纵向数据流中获取可操作的见解具有挑战性。需要一种方法来理解个体特定的生活方式选择可能带来的生理结果。

Abstract: Wearable sensor data offer opportunities for personalized health monitoring,
yet deriving actionable insights from their complex, longitudinal data streams
is challenging. This paper introduces a framework to learn personalized
counterfactual models from multivariate wearable data. This enables exploring
what-if scenarios to understand potential individual-specific outcomes of
lifestyle choices. Our approach first augments individual datasets with data
from similar patients via multi-modal similarity analysis. We then use a
temporal PC (Peter-Clark) algorithm adaptation to discover predictive
relationships, modeling how variables at time t-1 influence physiological
changes at time t. Gradient Boosting Machines are trained on these discovered
relationships to quantify individual-specific effects. These models drive a
counterfactual engine projecting physiological trajectories under hypothetical
interventions (e.g., activity or sleep changes). We evaluate the framework via
one-step-ahead predictive validation and by assessing the plausibility and
impact of interventions. Evaluation showed reasonable predictive accuracy
(e.g., mean heart rate MAE 4.71 bpm) and high counterfactual plausibility
(median 0.9643). Crucially, these interventions highlighted significant
inter-individual variability in response to hypothetical lifestyle changes,
showing the framework's potential for personalized insights. This work provides
a tool to explore personalized health dynamics and generate hypotheses on
individual responses to lifestyle changes.

Motivation: 解决RLVR方法需要昂贵标注且仅适用于可验证任务的限制，以及传统对偶学习仅限于严格对偶任务对的问题。

Method: 将原始任务输入分解为已知和未知组件，构建对偶任务来重建未知部分，使用重建质量作为自监督奖励来优化原始任务。

Result: 在756个翻译方向上平均提升2.13 COMET分数，在三个数学推理基准上平均提升6.4个百分点，作为推理时重排序器提升9.3个百分点。

Conclusion: DuPO是一个可扩展、通用且无需标注的LLM优化范式，通过自监督对偶学习实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: We present DuPO, a dual learning-based preference optimization framework that
generates annotation-free feedback via a generalized duality. DuPO addresses
two key limitations: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)'s
reliance on costly labels and applicability restricted to verifiable tasks, and
traditional dual learning's restriction to strictly dual task pairs (e.g.,
translation and back-translation). Specifically, DuPO decomposes a primal
task's input into known and unknown components, then constructs its dual task
to reconstruct the unknown part using the primal output and known information
(e.g., reversing math solutions to recover hidden variables), broadening
applicability to non-invertible tasks. The quality of this reconstruction
serves as a self-supervised reward to optimize the primal task, synergizing
with LLMs' ability to instantiate both tasks via a single model. Empirically,
DuPO achieves substantial gains across diverse tasks: it enhances the average
translation quality by 2.13 COMET over 756 directions, boosts the mathematical
reasoning accuracy by an average of 6.4 points on three challenge benchmarks,
and enhances performance by 9.3 points as an inference-time reranker (trading
computation for accuracy). These results position DuPO as a scalable, general,
and annotation-free paradigm for LLM optimization.

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) uncovers mathematical models from data. Several
benchmarks have been proposed to compare the performance of SR algorithms.
However, existing ground-truth rediscovery benchmarks overemphasize the
recovery of "the one" expression form or rely solely on computer algebra
systems (such as SymPy) to assess success. Furthermore, existing benchmarks
continue the expression search even after its discovery. We improve upon these
issues by introducing curated lists of acceptable expressions, and a callback
mechanism for early termination. As a starting point, we use the symbolic
regression for scientific discovery (SRSD) benchmark problems proposed by
Yoshitomo et al., and benchmark the two SR packages SymbolicRegression.jl and
TiSR. The new benchmarking method increases the rediscovery rate of
SymbolicRegression.jl from 26.7%, as reported by Yoshitomo et at., to 44.7%.
Performing the benchmark takes 41.2% less computational expense. TiSR's
rediscovery rate is 69.4%, while performing the benchmark saves 63% time.

Conclusion: 通过提出一种原理性的反事实引导方法来动态选择基线，该研究有效解决了医学图像解释性中的基线选择问题，为医学领域的深度学习模型提供了更可靠和可解释的输出。

Abstract: The explainability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge,
particularly in the medical domain where interpretable outputs are critical for
clinical trust and transparency. Path attribution methods such as Integrated
Gradients rely on a baseline input representing the absence of relevant
features ("missingness"). Commonly used baselines, such as all-zero inputs, are
often semantically meaningless, especially in medical contexts where
missingness can itself be informative. While alternative baseline choices have
been explored, existing methods lack a principled approach to dynamically
select baselines tailored to each input. In this work, we examine the notion of
missingness in the medical setting, analyze its implications for baseline
selection, and introduce a counterfactual-guided approach to address the
limitations of conventional baselines. We argue that a clinically normal but
input-close counterfactual represents a more accurate representation of a
meaningful absence of features in medical data. To implement this, we use a
Variational Autoencoder to generate counterfactual baselines, though our
concept is generative-model-agnostic and can be applied with any suitable
counterfactual method. We evaluate the approach on three distinct medical data
sets and empirically demonstrate that counterfactual baselines yield more
faithful and medically relevant attributions compared to standard baseline
choices.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Semantic Energy显著改善了幻觉检测和不确定性估计性能

Conclusion: 该方法为下游应用（如幻觉检测）提供了更可靠的不确定性信号，解决了语义熵方法的局限性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, but they remain susceptible to hallucinations, which produce
fluent yet incorrect responses and lead to erroneous decision-making.
Uncertainty estimation is a feasible approach to detect such hallucinations.
For example, semantic entropy estimates uncertainty by considering the semantic
diversity across multiple sampled responses, thus identifying hallucinations.
However, semantic entropy relies on post-softmax probabilities and fails to
capture the model's inherent uncertainty, causing it to be ineffective in
certain scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce Semantic Energy, a novel
uncertainty estimation framework that leverages the inherent confidence of LLMs
by operating directly on logits of penultimate layer. By combining semantic
clustering with a Boltzmann-inspired energy distribution, our method better
captures uncertainty in cases where semantic entropy fails. Experiments across
multiple benchmarks show that Semantic Energy significantly improves
hallucination detection and uncertainty estimation, offering more reliable
signals for downstream applications such as hallucination detection.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在二次时间内精确计算FANOVA高斯过程Shapley值的方法，解决了传统方法计算复杂度指数级增长的问题，为概率模型提供了可扩展且包含不确定性的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Shapley值作为特征重要性归因的经典方法，在计算上面临指数级复杂度挑战，特别是在概率模型（如高斯过程）中，由于输出是随机变量，需要额外计算高阶矩，使得实际应用受到严重限制。

Method: 针对FANOVA GP这类显式建模所有主效应和交互作用的模型，提出了两种方法：1）局部解释：定义基于函数分量的随机合作博弈，在二次时间内计算精确的随机Shapley值；2）全局解释：引入基于方差的确定性值函数，计算精确Shapley值。利用FANOVA分解的闭式Möbius表示和受牛顿恒等式启发的递归算法。

Result: 实现了在二次时间内计算精确的Shapley值，能够同时捕捉期望贡献和不确定性，量化每个特征对模型整体敏感性的贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了可解释AI的实用性，为结构化概率模型提供了更可扩展、公理上合理且包含不确定性感知的解释能力，通过实证研究验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Shapley values are widely recognized as a principled method for attributing
importance to input features in machine learning. However, the exact
computation of Shapley values scales exponentially with the number of features,
severely limiting the practical application of this powerful approach. The
challenge is further compounded when the predictive model is probabilistic - as
in Gaussian processes (GPs) - where the outputs are random variables rather
than point estimates, necessitating additional computational effort in modeling
higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that for an important class
of GPs known as FANOVA GP, which explicitly models all main effects and
interactions, *exact* Shapley attributions for both local and global
explanations can be computed in *quadratic time*. For local, instance-wise
explanations, we define a stochastic cooperative game over function components
and compute the exact stochastic Shapley value in quadratic time only,
capturing both the expected contribution and uncertainty. For global
explanations, we introduce a deterministic, variance-based value function and
compute exact Shapley values that quantify each feature's contribution to the
model's overall sensitivity. Our methods leverage a closed-form (stochastic)
M\"{o}bius representation of the FANOVA decomposition and introduce recursive
algorithms, inspired by Newton's identities, to efficiently compute the mean
and variance of Shapley values. Our work enhances the utility of explainable
AI, as demonstrated by empirical studies, by providing more scalable,
axiomatically sound, and uncertainty-aware explanations for predictions
generated by structured probabilistic models.

Abstract: This study proposes an anomaly detection method based on the Transformer
architecture with integrated multiscale feature perception, aiming to address
the limitations of temporal modeling and scale-aware feature representation in
cloud service environments. The method first employs an improved Transformer
module to perform temporal modeling on high-dimensional monitoring data, using
a self-attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies and contextual
semantics. Then, a multiscale feature construction path is introduced to
extract temporal features at different granularities through downsampling and
parallel encoding. An attention-weighted fusion module is designed to
dynamically adjust the contribution of each scale to the final decision,
enhancing the model's robustness in anomaly pattern modeling. In the input
modeling stage, standardized multidimensional time series are constructed,
covering core signals such as CPU utilization, memory usage, and task
scheduling states, while positional encoding is used to strengthen the model's
temporal awareness. A systematic experimental setup is designed to evaluate
performance, including comparative experiments and hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, focusing on the impact of optimizers, learning rates, anomaly ratios,
and noise levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms mainstream baseline models in key metrics, including precision,
recall, AUC, and F1-score, and maintains strong stability and detection
performance under various perturbation conditions, demonstrating its superior
capability in complex cloud environments.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road user movement is increasingly required by many
applications ranging from advanced driver assistance systems to autonomous
driving, and especially crucial for road safety. Even though most traffic
accident fatalities account to bicycles, they have received little attention,
as previous work focused mainly on pedestrians and motorized vehicles. In this
work, we present the Great GATsBi, a domain-knowledge-based, hybrid, multimodal
trajectory prediction framework for bicycles. The model incorporates both
physics-based modeling (inspired by motorized vehicles) and social-based
modeling (inspired by pedestrian movements) to explicitly account for the dual
nature of bicycle movement. The social interactions are modeled with a graph
attention network, and include decayed historical, but also anticipated, future
trajectory data of a bicycles neighborhood, following recent insights from
psychological and social studies. The results indicate that the proposed
ensemble of physics models -- performing well in the short-term predictions --
and social models -- performing well in the long-term predictions -- exceeds
state-of-the-art performance. We also conducted a controlled mass-cycling
experiment to demonstrate the framework's performance when forecasting bicycle
trajectories and modeling social interactions with road users.

ability of its underlying neural network to accurately approximate the
action-value function. Standard function approximators, such as multi-layer
perceptrons, may struggle to efficiently represent the complex value landscapes
inherent in many reinforcement learning problems. This paper introduces a novel
architecture, the Chebyshev-DQN (Ch-DQN), which integrates a Chebyshev
polynomial basis into the DQN framework to create a more effective feature
representation. By leveraging the powerful function approximation properties of
Chebyshev polynomials, we hypothesize that the Ch-DQN can learn more
efficiently and achieve higher performance. We evaluate our proposed model on
the CartPole-v1 benchmark and compare it against a standard DQN with a
comparable number of parameters. Our results demonstrate that the Ch-DQN with a
moderate polynomial degree (N=4) achieves significantly better asymptotic
performance, outperforming the baseline by approximately 39\%. However, we also
find that the choice of polynomial degree is a critical hyperparameter, as a
high degree (N=8) can be detrimental to learning. This work validates the
potential of using orthogonal polynomial bases in deep reinforcement learning
while also highlighting the trade-offs involved in model complexity.

Motivation: 联邦学习中数据异构性导致性能下降，除了已知的client drift外，cross-device FL中由于部分客户端参与产生的period drift问题尚未被充分研究，且可能比client drift更严重

Method: 提出predict-observe框架和FedEve方法，通过让两种drift相互补偿来减轻整体影响，理论证明能降低模型更新方差

Result: 大量实验表明在非IID数据的cross-device设置下，该方法优于其他替代方案

Conclusion: period drift是cross-device FL中的重要问题，与client drift相互作用，FedEve能有效缓解这两种drift的负面影响

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple
clients to collaboratively train a shared model without exposing their private
data. Data heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge in FL, which can result in
poor convergence and performance degradation. Client drift has been recognized
as one of the factors contributing to this issue resulting from the multiple
local updates in FedAvg. However, in cross-device FL, a different form of drift
arises due to the partial client participation, but it has not been studied
well. This drift, we referred as period drift, occurs as participating clients
at each communication round may exhibit distinct data distribution that
deviates from that of all clients. It could be more harmful than client drift
since the optimization objective shifts with every round.
  In this paper, we investigate the interaction between period drift and client
drift, finding that period drift can have a particularly detrimental effect on
cross-device FL as the degree of data heterogeneity increases. To tackle these
issues, we propose a predict-observe framework and present an instantiated
method, FedEve, where these two types of drift can compensate each other to
mitigate their overall impact. We provide theoretical evidence that our
approach can reduce the variance of model updates. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms alternatives on non-iid data in
cross-device settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究大语言模型推理优化调度策略，通过机器学习预测输出长度来最小化总延迟，提出了一种动态调整的算法以应对输出长度的不确定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推理是一种在线多任务服务过程，能消耗很大，而输出长度的不确定性严重影响内存使用和处理时间，需要提高调度效率和降低能耗。

Method: 提出了两种算法：保守算法α_max（基于预测输出长度上限调度）和适应算法α_min（基于预测下限并动态精细估计）。α_min算法在推理过程中动态调整输出长度估计。

Result: 通过数值模拟验证，α_min算法表现几乎与后见调度器相当，具有高效和稳健性，近似于最优解。证明了α_min达到对数级竞争比。

Conclusion: α_min算法通过仅使用预测区间下限的设计选择，有效解决了输出长度不确定性带来的挑战，在实际场景中展现出良好的性能和实用性。

Abstract: We study the problem of optimizing Large Language Model (LLM) inference
scheduling to minimize total latency. LLM inference is an online and multi-task
service process and also heavily energy consuming by which a pre-trained LLM
processes input requests and generates output tokens sequentially. Therefore,
it is vital to improve its scheduling efficiency and reduce the power
consumption while a great amount of prompt requests are arriving. A key
challenge in LLM inference scheduling is that while the prompt length is known
upon arrival, the output length, which critically impacts memory usage and
processing time, is unknown. To address this uncertainty, we propose algorithms
that leverage machine learning to predict output lengths, assuming the
prediction provides an interval classification (min-max range) for each
request.
  We first design a conservative algorithm, $\mathcal{A}_{\max}$, which
schedules requests based on the upper bound of predicted output lengths to
prevent memory overflow. However, this approach is overly conservative: as
prediction accuracy decreases, performance degrades significantly due to
potential overestimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$, an adaptive algorithm that initially treats the predicted
lower bound as the output length and dynamically refines this estimate during
inferencing. We prove that $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ achieves a log-scale
competitive ratio. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that
$\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ often performs nearly as well as the hindsight scheduler,
highlighting both its efficiency and robustness in practical scenarios.
Moreover, $\mathcal{A}_{\min}$ relies solely on the lower bound of the
prediction interval--an advantageous design choice since upper bounds on output
length are typically more challenging to predict accurately.

Method: 开发统一的框架，支持多种本地更新SGD算法，允许动态拓扑变化和客户端选择，采用非均匀聚合策略

Result: 该框架为动态拓扑的分布式SGD算法提供了改进的理论收敛保证，性能优于传统固定拓扑方法

Conclusion: 动态拓扑和非均匀聚合策略是提升分布式SGD性能的有效方法，所提统一框架为此类算法提供了更好的理论基础

Abstract: One of the most common methods to train machine learning algorithms today is
the stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In a distributed setting, SGD-based
algorithms have been shown to converge theoretically under specific
circumstances. A substantial number of works in the distributed SGD setting
assume a fixed topology for the edge devices. These papers also assume that the
contribution of nodes to the global model is uniform. However, experiments have
shown that such assumptions are suboptimal and a non uniform aggregation
strategy coupled with a dynamically shifting topology and client selection can
significantly improve the performance of such models. This paper details a
unified framework that covers several Local-Update SGD-based distributed
algorithms with dynamic topologies and provides improved or matching
theoretical guarantees on convergence compared to existing work.

Result: 实验结果表明，密度比估计核心的选择会显著影响公平性测量结果，甚至导致对不同算法相对公平性的不一致结论。

Abstract: The prevalence of algorithmic bias in Machine Learning (ML)-driven approaches
has inspired growing research on measuring and mitigating bias in the ML
domain. Accordingly, prior research studied how to measure fairness in
regression which is a complex problem. In particular, recent research proposed
to formulate it as a density-ratio estimation problem and relied on a Logistic
Regression-driven probabilistic classifier-based approach to solve it. However,
there are several other methods to estimate a density ratio, and to the best of
our knowledge, prior work did not study the sensitivity of such fairness
measurement methods to the choice of underlying density ratio estimation
algorithm. To fill this gap, this paper develops a set of fairness measurement
methods with various density-ratio estimation cores and thoroughly investigates
how different cores would affect the achieved level of fairness. Our
experimental results show that the choice of density-ratio estimation core
could significantly affect the outcome of fairness measurement method, and
even, generate inconsistent results with respect to the relative fairness of
various algorithms. These observations suggest major issues with density-ratio
estimation based fairness measurement in regression and a need for further
research to enhance their reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DualNILM是一个基于Transformer的多任务学习框架，用于解决智能家居中分布式能源接入导致的非侵入式负荷监测性能下降问题，能够同时准确识别电器状态和注入能量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NILM方法仅依赖电表数据，但随着太阳能板、电池储能等分布式能源的普及，这些能源注入的电能会掩盖单个电器的功率特征，导致NILM性能显著下降。

Method: 提出DualNILM深度多任务学习框架，结合sequence-to-point和sequence-to-sequence策略，在Transformer架构中捕捉聚合功耗模式的多尺度时间依赖性。

Result: 在包含电器级能耗和能量注入的自收集和合成开源NILM数据集上进行验证，实验结果表明DualNILM在双任务上保持优异性能，大幅超越传统方法。

Conclusion: DualNILM有效解决了分布式能源接入对NILM的挑战，为智能家居和建筑应用中的精细能耗监测提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) offers a cost-effective method to obtain
fine-grained appliance-level energy consumption in smart homes and building
applications. However, the increasing adoption of behind-the-meter energy
sources, such as solar panels and battery storage, poses new challenges for
conventional NILM methods that rely solely on at-the-meter data. The injected
energy from the behind-the-meter sources can obscure the power signatures of
individual appliances, leading to a significant decline in NILM performance. To
address this challenge, we present DualNILM, a deep multi-task learning
framework designed for the dual tasks of appliance state recognition and
injected energy identification in NILM. By integrating sequence-to-point and
sequence-to-sequence strategies within a Transformer-based architecture,
DualNILM can effectively capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in the
aggregate power consumption patterns, allowing for accurate appliance state
recognition and energy injection identification. We conduct validation of
DualNILM using both self-collected and synthesized open NILM datasets that
include both appliance-level energy consumption and energy injection. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that DualNILM maintains an excellent
performance for the dual tasks in NILM, much outperforming conventional
methods.

### [196] [Measuring IIA Violations in Similarity Choices with Bayesian Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14615)
*Hugo Sales Corrêa,Suryanarayana Sankagiri,Daniel Ratton Figueiredo,Matthias Grossglauser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种统计方法来检验相似性选择中的IIA假设，发现显著违反IIA的现象，表明需要开发考虑情境效应的新模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相似性选择数据在信息检索和嵌入学习等场景中很常见，但传统基于度量的模型假设无关选项独立性(IIA)。虽然IIA违反在许多离散选择设置中已被发现，但相似性选择设置很少被研究，因为目标依赖性质使IIA测试变得复杂。

Method: 提出了两种统计测试方法：经典的拟合优度测试和基于后验预测检查(PPC)的贝叶斯方法。贝叶斯方法能够量化IIA违反的程度而不仅仅是显著性。还设计了新的PPC测试来检验群体同质性。

Result: 在两个数据集上都检测到显著的IIA违反，且随机生成的选择集与专门设计的选择集显示出相似的违反程度。群体同质性测试表明群体确实是同质的，说明IIA违反是由选择集内的情境效应驱动的。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要开发能够解释此类情境效应的新相似性选择模型，因为传统的IIA假设在相似性选择设置中不成立。

Abstract: Similarity choice data occur when humans make choices among alternatives
based on their similarity to a target, e.g., in the context of information
retrieval and in embedding learning settings. Classical metric-based models of
similarity choice assume independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA), a
property that allows for a simpler formulation. While IIA violations have been
detected in many discrete choice settings, the similarity choice setting has
received scant attention. This is because the target-dependent nature of the
choice complicates IIA testing. We propose two statistical methods to test for
IIA: a classical goodness-of-fit test and a Bayesian counterpart based on the
framework of Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC). This Bayesian approach, our
main technical contribution, quantifies the degree of IIA violation beyond its
mere significance. We curate two datasets: one with choice sets designed to
elicit IIA violations, and another with randomly generated choice sets from the
same item universe. Our tests confirmed significant IIA violations on both
datasets, and notably, we find a comparable degree of violation between them.
Further, we devise a new PPC test for population homogeneity. Results show that
the population is indeed homogenous, suggesting that the IIA violations are
driven by context effects -- specifically, interactions within the choice sets.
These results highlight the need for new similarity choice models that account
for such context effects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个模糊增强可解释AI框架(FEXAI)，结合模糊逻辑、机器学习和SHAP分析，用于分析连续下降操作(CDO)性能影响因素，实现了90%以上的分类准确率并提供了可解释的模糊规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续下降操作(CDO)具有减少燃油消耗、排放和噪音等优势，但缺乏系统性研究其性能影响因素的方法，且现有轨迹优化方法缺乏航空领域所需的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 收集1094个航班的ADS-B数据(29个特征)，应用机器学习模型和SHAP分析分类CDO依从水平并排序特征重要性，使用最重要的三个特征构建模糊规则分类器。

Result: 所有模型分类准确率超过90%，识别出平均下降速率、下降段数量和平均航向变化是最强预测因子，FEXAI提供了人类可读的解释性规则。

Conclusion: FEXAI方法为运行决策支持提供了新途径，可集成到航空工具中实现实时建议，在各种运行条件下保持CDO依从性。

Abstract: Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that
avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving
efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental
benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing
CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as
trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where
explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study
addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI)
framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive
dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related
features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent
Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then
applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by
importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores,
were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the
extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification
accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for
operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the
arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in
directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO
performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway
for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to
enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying
operational conditions.

TL;DR: 该研究通过将SNOMED医学术语层次结构映射到双曲空间，生成Poincaré嵌入，并将其整合到深度学习模型中，以改进肺癌发病预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的临床预测模型通常忽略临床概念之间的语义关系。本研究旨在通过整合领域特定的语义信息来改善肺癌发病预测。

Method: 从SNOMED分类法中构建临床知识图谱，通过黎曼随机梯度下降生成Poincaré嵌入，并将这些嵌入整合到ResNet和Transformer深度学习架构中。

Result: 使用预训练的Poincaré嵌入相比使用随机初始化欧几里得嵌入的基线模型，在判别性能上有适度但一致的改进。ResNet模型（特别是使用10维Poincaré嵌入的）显示出更好的校准性能，而Transformer模型在各种配置下保持稳定的校准。

Conclusion: 将临床知识图谱嵌入双曲空间并整合到深度学习模型中，可以通过保留用于预测的临床术语的层次结构来改善肺癌发病预测。这种方法展示了将数据驱动的特征提取与既定临床知识相结合的可行方法。

Abstract: Background: Existing clinical prediction models often represent patient data
using features that ignore the semantic relationships between clinical
concepts. This study integrates domain-specific semantic information by mapping
the SNOMED medical term hierarchy into a low-dimensional hyperbolic space using
Poincar\'e embeddings, with the aim of improving lung cancer onset prediction.
  Methods: Using a retrospective cohort from the Optum EHR dataset, we derived
a clinical knowledge graph from the SNOMED taxonomy and generated Poincar\'e
embeddings via Riemannian stochastic gradient descent. These embeddings were
then incorporated into two deep learning architectures, a ResNet and a
Transformer model. Models were evaluated for discrimination (area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve) and calibration (average absolute
difference between observed and predicted probabilities) performance.
  Results: Incorporating pre-trained Poincar\'e embeddings resulted in modest
and consistent improvements in discrimination performance compared to baseline
models using randomly initialized Euclidean embeddings. ResNet models,
particularly those using a 10-dimensional Poincar\'e embedding, showed enhanced
calibration, whereas Transformer models maintained stable calibration across
configurations.
  Discussion: Embedding clinical knowledge graphs into hyperbolic space and
integrating these representations into deep learning models can improve lung
cancer onset prediction by preserving the hierarchical structure of clinical
terminologies used for prediction. This approach demonstrates a feasible method
for combining data-driven feature extraction with established clinical
knowledge.

Conclusion: Diff-In方法有效解决了现有影响力分析工具的局限性，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了估计精度，为数据中心的AI任务提供了强有力的工具。

Abstract: Data plays a pivotal role in the groundbreaking advancements in artificial
intelligence. The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to
model training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.
However, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many
of these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.
These limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.
In this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's
influence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive
learning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the
sample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across
successive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we
approximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the
need for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a
second-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to
that of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved
by computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently
approximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the
approximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our
theoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower
approximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive
experiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset
selection. Notably, our experiments on data pruning for large-scale
vision-language pre-training show that Diff-In can scale to millions of data
points and outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: Time-series prediction involves forecasting future values using machine
learning models. Feature engineering, whereby existing features are transformed
to make new ones, is critical for enhancing model performance, but is often
manual and time-intensive. Existing automation attempts rely on exhaustive
enumeration, which can be computationally costly and lacks domain-specific
insights. We introduce ELATE (Evolutionary Language model for Automated
Time-series Engineering), which leverages a language model within an
evolutionary framework to automate feature engineering for time-series data.
ELATE employs time-series statistical measures and feature importance metrics
to guide and prune features, while the language model proposes new,
contextually relevant feature transformations. Our experiments demonstrate that
ELATE improves forecasting accuracy by an average of 8.4% across various
domains.

Conclusion: Fair-ICD在适度条件下确保了GNN的公平性，为图神经网络公平性研究提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successful in modeling
graph-structured data. However, similar to other machine learning models, GNNs
can exhibit bias in predictions based on attributes like race and gender.
Moreover, bias in GNNs can be exacerbated by the graph structure and
message-passing mechanisms. Recent cutting-edge methods propose mitigating bias
by filtering out sensitive information from input or representations, like edge
dropping or feature masking. Yet, we argue that such strategies may
unintentionally eliminate non-sensitive features, leading to a compromised
balance between predictive accuracy and fairness. To tackle this challenge, we
present a novel approach utilizing counterfactual data augmentation for bias
mitigation. This method involves creating diverse neighborhoods using
counterfactuals before message passing, facilitating unbiased node
representations learning from the augmented graph. Subsequently, an adversarial
discriminator is employed to diminish bias in predictions by conventional GNN
classifiers. Our proposed technique, Fair-ICD, ensures the fairness of GNNs
under moderate conditions. Experiments on standard datasets using three GNN
backbones demonstrate that Fair-ICD notably enhances fairness metrics while
preserving high predictive performance.

Conclusion: CES2-GAD方法通过谱分析和因果边分离有效解决了异配图中的异常检测问题，填补了谱域异配问题研究的空白

Abstract: In the real world, anomalous entities often add more legitimate connections
while hiding direct links with other anomalous entities, leading to
heterophilic structures in anomalous networks that most GNN-based techniques
fail to address. Several works have been proposed to tackle this issue in the
spatial domain. However, these methods overlook the complex relationships
between node structure encoding, node features, and their contextual
environment and rely on principled guidance, research on solving spectral
domain heterophilic problems remains limited. This study analyzes the spectral
distribution of nodes with different heterophilic degrees and discovers that
the heterophily of anomalous nodes causes the spectral energy to shift from low
to high frequencies. To address the above challenges, we propose a spectral
neural network CES2-GAD based on causal edge separation for anomaly detection
on heterophilic graphs. Firstly, CES2-GAD will separate the original graph into
homophilic and heterophilic edges using causal interventions. Subsequently,
various hybrid-spectrum filters are used to capture signals from the segmented
graphs. Finally, representations from multiple signals are concatenated and
input into a classifier to predict anomalies. Extensive experiments with
real-world datasets have proven the effectiveness of the method we proposed.

Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, acquiring all features of a data instance can
be expensive or impractical due to monetary cost, latency, or privacy concerns.
Active Feature Acquisition (AFA) addresses this challenge by dynamically
selecting a subset of informative features for each data instance, trading
predictive performance against acquisition cost. While numerous methods have
been proposed for AFA, ranging from greedy information-theoretic strategies to
non-myopic reinforcement learning approaches, fair and systematic evaluation of
these methods has been hindered by the lack of standardized benchmarks. In this
paper, we introduce AFABench, the first benchmark framework for AFA. Our
benchmark includes a diverse set of synthetic and real-world datasets, supports
a wide range of acquisition policies, and provides a modular design that
enables easy integration of new methods and tasks. We implement and evaluate
representative algorithms from all major categories, including static, greedy,
and reinforcement learning-based approaches. To test the lookahead capabilities
of AFA policies, we introduce a novel synthetic dataset, AFAContext, designed
to expose the limitations of greedy selection. Our results highlight key
trade-offs between different AFA strategies and provide actionable insights for
future research. The benchmark code is available at:

Abstract: Reasoning graphs from Large Language Models (LLMs) are often misaligned with
downstream visual tasks such as video anomaly detection (VAD). Existing Graph
Structure Refinement (GSR) methods are ill-suited for these novel, dataset-less
graphs. We introduce Data-driven GSR (D-GSR), a new paradigm that directly
optimizes graph structure using downstream task data, and propose MissionHD, a
hyperdimensional computing (HDC) framework to operationalize it. MissionHD uses
an efficient encode-decode process to refine the graph, guided by the
downstream task signal. Experiments on challenging VAD and VAR benchmarks show
significant performance improvements when using our refined graphs, validating
our approach as an effective pre-processing step.

*Yunzhe Zhang,Yifei Wang,Khanh Vinh Nguyen,Pengyu Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CMCM-DLM是一个基于预训练扩散模型的跨模态分子生成方法，通过两个可训练模块（SCM和PCM）分阶段注入结构和属性约束，无需重新训练即可支持多模态约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SMILES扩散模型仅支持单模态约束，需要重新训练来适应新约束。实际应用中常需要处理多模态约束且约束可能动态变化，因此需要能够灵活扩展预训练模型的方法。

Method: 在预训练扩散模型基础上引入两个可训练模块：结构控制模块（SCM）在扩散早期注入结构约束，属性控制模块（PCM）在后期注入属性约束。采用两阶段生成过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明该方法具有高效性和适应性，能够有效生成满足多模态约束的分子。

Conclusion: CMCM-DLM在药物发现领域的分子生成方面取得了显著进展，为处理动态多模态约束提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current SMILES-based diffusion models for molecule generation typically
support only unimodal constraint. They inject conditioning signals at the start
of the training process and require retraining a new model from scratch
whenever the constraint changes. However, real-world applications often involve
multiple constraints across different modalities, and additional constraints
may emerge over the course of a study. This raises a challenge: how to extend a
pre-trained diffusion model not only to support cross-modality constraints but
also to incorporate new ones without retraining. To tackle this problem, we
propose the Cross-Modality Controlled Molecule Generation with Diffusion
Language Model (CMCM-DLM), demonstrated by two distinct cross modalities:
molecular structure and chemical properties. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained diffusion model, incorporating two trainable modules, the Structure
Control Module (SCM) and the Property Control Module (PCM), and operates in two
distinct phases during the generation process. In Phase I, we employs the SCM
to inject structural constraints during the early diffusion steps, effectively
anchoring the molecular backbone. Phase II builds on this by further
introducing PCM to guide the later stages of inference to refine the generated
molecules, ensuring their chemical properties match the specified targets.
Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the efficiency and
adaptability of our approach, highlighting CMCM-DLM's significant advancement
in molecular generation for drug discovery applications.

TL;DR: HERAKLES是一个分层自目标AI代理框架，通过将掌握的技能编译到小型快速神经网络中，动态扩展高层策略可用的子目标空间，利用LLM进行目标分解和泛化，在开放环境中有效应对复杂性增长的目标学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放环境中AI代理需要高效学习日益复杂、抽象和异构目标的问题，同时控制样本和计算复杂度的增长，避免现有方法依赖专家定义子目标空间和预训练底层策略的局限性。

Method: 采用两层分层架构：1）将已掌握目标编译到小型快速神经网络的底层策略；2）使用LLM作为高层控制器进行目标分解和泛化，动态扩展子目标空间。在Crafter开放环境中进行验证。

Result: HERAKLES能够有效随目标复杂性扩展，通过技能编译提高样本效率，使代理能够随时间稳健适应新挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了在开放环境中通过动态技能编译和LLM引导的分层控制，能够有效管理目标复杂性增长，实现持续学习和适应能力。

Abstract: Open-ended AI agents need to be able to learn efficiently goals of increasing
complexity, abstraction and heterogeneity over their lifetime. Beyond sampling
efficiently their own goals, autotelic agents specifically need to be able to
keep the growing complexity of goals under control, limiting the associated
growth in sample and computational complexity. To adress this challenge, recent
approaches have leveraged hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) and
language, capitalizing on its compositional and combinatorial generalization
capabilities to acquire temporally extended reusable behaviours. Existing
approaches use expert defined spaces of subgoals over which they instantiate a
hierarchy, and often assume pre-trained associated low-level policies. Such
designs are inadequate in open-ended scenarios, where goal spaces naturally
diversify across a broad spectrum of difficulties. We introduce HERAKLES, a
framework that enables a two-level hierarchical autotelic agent to continuously
compile mastered goals into the low-level policy, executed by a small, fast
neural network, dynamically expanding the set of subgoals available to the
high-level policy. We train a Large Language Model (LLM) to serve as the
high-level controller, exploiting its strengths in goal decomposition and
generalization to operate effectively over this evolving subgoal space. We
evaluate HERAKLES in the open-ended Crafter environment and show that it scales
effectively with goal complexity, improves sample efficiency through skill
compilation, and enables the agent to adapt robustly to novel challenges over
time.

<details>

Motivation: 解决治疗性肽设计面临的序列空间巨大、实验数据有限、现有生成模型可解释性差等挑战

Method: 集成大型语言模型(LLMs)与思维链监督微调和强化学习，通过定制奖励函数平衡化学有效性和属性改进，实现自主序列变体探索

Conclusion: 这是首个结合显式推理与强化学习驱动属性控制的LLM肽设计框架，为治疗发现提供了可靠且透明的肽优化方法

Abstract: Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the
vastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor
interpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we
introduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language
models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly
reasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling
interpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological
properties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity
and property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence
variants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with
significantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming
existing general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both
optimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first
LLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with
RL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent
peptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.

TL;DR: 本文提出挤压扩散模型(SDM)，通过数据相关的方式各向异性地缩放噪声，在CIFAR和CelebA数据集上实现FID提升15%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受量子压缩态根据海森堡不确定性原理重新分配不确定性的启发，传统扩散模型使用各向同性高斯噪声忽略了数据结构，希望通过数据感知的噪声缩放来更好地学习重要特征

Method: 提出两种配置：海森堡扩散模型(在主轴补偿缩放并在正交方向反向缩放)和标准SDM变体(仅缩放主轴)，研究不同程度的压缩和反压缩效果

Result: 反直觉地发现，在CIFAR-10/100和CelebA-64上，轻微的反压缩(在主轴上增加方差)持续改善FID达15%，并将精度-召回边界向更高召回率移动

Conclusion: 简单、数据感知的噪声整形可以在不改变架构的情况下提供稳健的生成增益，证明了数据相关噪声缩放的有效性

Abstract: Diffusion models typically inject isotropic Gaussian noise, disregarding
structure in the data. Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states
redistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we
introduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically
along the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing
enhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling
noise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning
important data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg
diffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse
scaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales
only the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,
mild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -
consistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier
toward higher recall. Our results demonstrate that simple, data-aware noise
shaping can deliver robust generative gains without architectural changes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EdgeFD是一种高效的联邦蒸馏方法，通过KMeans密度比估计器简化客户端数据处理，无需服务器端过滤，在非IID数据下实现接近IID的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦蒸馏方法需要复杂的知识共享策略和昂贵的统计密度比估计，服务器端过滤引入延迟，需要更高效的方法

Method: 提出EdgeFD方法，使用KMeans密度比估计器有效过滤客户端的内分布和外分布代理数据，无需预训练教师模型

Result: 在强非IID、弱非IID和IID数据分布下均优于现有方法，计算开销显著降低，适合资源受限设备

Conclusion: EdgeFD提高了联邦蒸馏的可扩展性和实际应用性，为边缘设备部署提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Federated distillation has emerged as a promising collaborative machine
learning approach, offering enhanced privacy protection and reduced
communication compared to traditional federated learning by exchanging model
outputs (soft logits) rather than full model parameters. However, existing
methods employ complex selective knowledge-sharing strategies that require
clients to identify in-distribution proxy data through computationally
expensive statistical density ratio estimators. Additionally, server-side
filtering of ambiguous knowledge introduces latency to the process. To address
these challenges, we propose a robust, resource-efficient EdgeFD method that
reduces the complexity of the client-side density ratio estimation and removes
the need for server-side filtering. EdgeFD introduces an efficient KMeans-based
density ratio estimator for effectively filtering both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution proxy data on clients, significantly improving the quality
of knowledge sharing. We evaluate EdgeFD across diverse practical scenarios,
including strong non-IID, weak non-IID, and IID data distributions on clients,
without requiring a pre-trained teacher model on the server for knowledge
distillation. Experimental results demonstrate that EdgeFD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, consistently achieving accuracy levels close to IID
scenarios even under heterogeneous and challenging conditions. The
significantly reduced computational overhead of the KMeans-based estimator is
suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, thereby enhancing
the scalability and real-world applicability of federated distillation. The
code is available online for reproducibility.

### [211] [Context Steering: A New Paradigm for Compression-based Embeddings by Synthesizing Relevant Information Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14780)
*Guillermo Sarasa Durán,Ana Granados Fontecha,Francisco de Borja Rodríguez Ortíz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"上下文引导"的新方法，通过主动指导特征形成过程来改进基于压缩的距离度量在聚类和分类任务中的表现，而不是被动接受数据中自然涌现的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于压缩的距离度量虽然灵活且领域无关，但因其相似性特征是从数据中自动推导而非预先定义，往往难以与特定任务对齐，特别是在复杂的聚类或分类场景中。

Method: 通过系统分析每个对象在聚类框架内如何影响关系上下文，主动"引导"特征形成过程，生成定制的嵌入空间来分离和放大类别区分性信息。使用NCD和NRC距离度量结合层次聚类进行验证。

Result: 在从文本到真实世界音频的异构数据集上的实验验证了上下文引导方法的鲁棒性和通用性，为压缩距离度量的应用提供了有效替代方案。

Conclusion: 该方法标志着从仅仅发现固有数据结构到主动塑造针对特定目标定制的特征空间的根本转变，显著提升了基于压缩的距离度量在复杂任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Compression-based distances (CD) offer a flexible and domain-agnostic means
of measuring similarity by identifying implicit information through
redundancies between data objects. However, as similarity features are derived
from the data, rather than defined as an input, it often proves difficult to
align with the task at hand, particularly in complex clustering or
classification settings. To address this issue, we introduce "context
steering," a novel methodology that actively guides the feature-shaping
process. Instead of passively accepting the emergent data structure (typically
a hierarchy derived from clustering CDs), our approach "steers" the process by
systematically analyzing how each object influences the relational context
within a clustering framework. This process generates a custom-tailored
embedding that isolates and amplifies class-distinctive information. We
validate the capabilities of this strategy using Normalized Compression
Distance (NCD) and Relative Compression Distance (NRC) with common hierarchical
clustering, providing an effective alternative to common transductive methods.
Experimental results across heterogeneous datasets-from text to real-world
audio-validate the robustness and generality of context steering, marking a
fundamental shift in their application: from merely discovering inherent data
structures to actively shaping a feature space tailored to a specific
objective.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的适应性模型精炼框架，通过动态数据增帽和矢量化知识转移，在减少计算开销的同时提高了学生模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型精炼方法存在计算开销大和泛化能力有限的问题，需要一种更高效的方法来在资源受限环境中部署系统。

Method: 使用UMAP降维和最近邻采样识别学生模型损失高的区域，生成针对性的合成样本。同时引入轻量级教师-学生接口，跳过教师输入层直接在矢量表示上进行知识转移。

Result: 在标准NLP测试集上，66M参数的学生模型表现超过基线方法：QNLI达到91.2%，SST-2达到92.3%，同时训练时间更短。

Conclusion: 损失感知数据增帽和矢量化精炼技术为高效模型压缩提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Model distillation enables the transfer of knowledge from large-scale models
to compact student models, facilitating deployment in resource-constrained
environments. However, conventional distillation approaches often suffer from
computational overhead and limited generalization. We propose a novel adaptive
distillation framework that dynamically augments training data in regions of
high student model loss. Using UMAP-based dimensionality reduction and nearest
neighbor sampling, our method identifies underperforming regions in the
embedding space and generates targeted synthetic examples to guide student
learning. To further improve efficiency, we introduce a lightweight
teacher-student interface that bypasses the teacher's input layer, enabling
direct distillation on vectorized representations. Experiments across standard
NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our 66M-parameter student model consistently
matches or surpasses established baselines, achieving 91.2% on QNLI and 92.3%
on SST-2, while training with fewer epochs. These results highlight the promise
of loss-aware data augmentation and vectorized distillation for efficient and
effective model compression.

Abstract: Despite the high demand for manually annotated image data, managing complex
and costly annotation projects remains under-discussed. This is partly due to
the fact that leading such projects requires dealing with a set of diverse and
interconnected challenges which often fall outside the expertise of specific
domain experts, leaving practical guidelines scarce. These challenges range
widely from data collection to resource allocation and recruitment, from
mitigation of biases to effective training of the annotators. This paper
provides a domain-agnostic preparation guide for annotation projects, with a
focus on scientific imagery. Drawing from the authors' extensive experience in
managing a large manual annotation project, it addresses fundamental concepts
including success measures, annotation subjects, project goals, data
availability, and essential team roles. Additionally, it discusses various
human biases and recommends tools and technologies to improve annotation
quality and efficiency. The goal is to encourage further research and
frameworks for creating a comprehensive knowledge base to reduce the costs of
manual annotation projects across various fields.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM)框架，通过直接修改源分布而非修改概率流向量场来实现生成模型引导，保持预训练向量场不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型引导方法通过修改概率流向量场来添加引导场，但这种方法可能不够灵活。本文旨在提供一种更直接且灵活的引导方式。

Method: SGFM框架将引导问题转化为从源分布采样的明确定义问题，保持预训练向量场完整，只修改源分布。

Result: 理论证明SGFM能精确恢复目标分布，提供Wasserstein误差界限，实验在合成2D基准、图像数据集和物理信息生成任务中验证有效性。

Conclusion: SGFM框架提供了灵活且精确的生成模型引导方法，用户可根据具体问题选择采样方法，与最优流匹配模型兼容性好。

Abstract: Guidance of generative models is typically achieved by modifying the
probability flow vector field through the addition of a guidance field. In this
paper, we instead propose the Source-Guided Flow Matching (SGFM) framework,
which modifies the source distribution directly while keeping the pre-trained
vector field intact. This reduces the guidance problem to a well-defined
problem of sampling from the source distribution. We theoretically show that
SGFM recovers the desired target distribution exactly. Furthermore, we provide
bounds on the Wasserstein error for the generated distribution when using an
approximate sampler of the source distribution and an approximate vector field.
The key benefit of our approach is that it allows the user to flexibly choose
the sampling method depending on their specific problem. To illustrate this, we
systematically compare different sampling methods and discuss conditions for
asymptotically exact guidance. Moreover, our framework integrates well with
optimal flow matching models since the straight transport map generated by the
vector field is preserved. Experimental results on synthetic 2D benchmarks,
image datasets, and physics-informed generative tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed framework.

Conclusion: 论文通过理论分析和创新的图增强技术，成功提升了对比学习在链接预测任务中的性能，为相关研究提供了重要的理论和实践贡献

Abstract: Link prediction is one of the most fundamental tasks in graph mining, which
motivates the recent studies of leveraging contrastive learning to enhance the
performance. However, we observe two major weaknesses of these studies: i) the
lack of theoretical analysis for contrastive learning on link prediction, and
ii) inadequate consideration of node degrees in contrastive learning. To
address the above weaknesses, we provide the first formal theoretical analysis
for contrastive learning on link prediction, where our analysis results can
generalize to the autoencoder-based link prediction models with contrastive
learning. Motivated by our analysis results, we propose a new graph
augmentation approach, Edge Balancing Augmentation (EBA), which adjusts the
node degrees in the graph as the augmentation. We then propose a new approach,
named Contrastive Link Prediction with Edge Balancing Augmentation (CoEBA),
that integrates the proposed EBA and the proposed new contrastive losses to
improve the model performance. We conduct experiments on 8 benchmark datasets.
The results demonstrate that our proposed CoEBA significantly outperforms the
other state-of-the-art link prediction models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用潜在Kronecker高斯过程预测学习曲线来指导Successive Halving算法，以避免过早剪枝慢启动的超参数候选。虽然预测方法表现有竞争力，但需要完全观测的学习曲线数据，不如直接为标准方法投入更多资源有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Successive Halving算法依赖中间性能值做资源分配决策，容易过早剪枝那些启动慢但最终可能成为最优的候选参数。

Method: 使用潜在Kronecker高斯过程预测学习曲线来指导Successive Halving算法的资源分配决策。

Result: 预测方法能达到竞争性性能，但相比为标准方法投入更多资源，不是帕累托最优，因为需要完全观测的学习曲线作为训练数据。

Conclusion: 虽然学习曲线预测方法有潜力，但需要依赖现有学习曲线数据来缓解数据需求问题。

Abstract: Successive Halving is a popular algorithm for hyperparameter optimization
which allocates exponentially more resources to promising candidates. However,
the algorithm typically relies on intermediate performance values to make
resource allocation decisions, which can cause it to prematurely prune slow
starters that would eventually become the best candidate. We investigate
whether guiding Successive Halving with learning curve predictions based on
Latent Kronecker Gaussian Processes can overcome this limitation. In a
large-scale empirical study involving different neural network architectures
and a click prediction dataset, we compare this predictive approach to the
standard approach based on current performance values. Our experiments show
that, although the predictive approach achieves competitive performance, it is
not Pareto optimal compared to investing more resources into the standard
approach, because it requires fully observed learning curves as training data.
However, this downside could be mitigated by leveraging existing learning curve
data.

Conclusion: AME提供了一个原则性和可推广的数据无关模型权重聚合概念，为神经网络平均化提供了理论定义和实践方法。

Abstract: What does it even mean to average neural networks? We investigate the problem
of synthesizing a single neural network from a collection of pretrained models,
each trained on disjoint data shards, using only their final weights and no
access to training data. In forming a definition of neural averaging, we take
insight from model soup, which appears to aggregate multiple models into a
singular model while enhancing generalization performance. In this work, we
reinterpret model souping as a special case of a broader framework: Amortized
Model Ensembling (AME) for neural averaging, a data-free meta-optimization
approach that treats model differences as pseudogradients to guide neural
weight updates. We show that this perspective not only recovers model soup but
enables more expressive and adaptive ensembling strategies. Empirically, AME
produces averaged neural solutions that outperform both individual experts and
model soup baselines, especially in out-of-distribution settings. Our results
suggest a principled and generalizable notion of data-free model weight
aggregation and defines, in one sense, how to perform neural averaging.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法要么依赖离散标记空间的低效搜索，要么优化连续嵌入但无法直接应用于专有模型，且投影回离散标记会降低攻击效果。

Method: 使用指数梯度下降和Bregman投影直接优化松弛的one-hot编码，确保每个标记的优化编码始终保持在概率单纯形内。

Result: 在5个开源LLM和4个对抗行为数据集上评估，相比三个最先进基线方法，取得了更高的成功率和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成通用对抗后缀，在不同提示间具有有效性，并展示了优化后缀到不同LLM的可迁移性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, ensuring their robustness and safety alignment remains a major
challenge. Despite the overall success of alignment techniques such as
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) on typical prompts, LLMs
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks enabled by crafted adversarial triggers
appended to user prompts. Most existing jailbreak methods either rely on
inefficient searches over discrete token spaces or direct optimization of
continuous embeddings. While continuous embeddings can be given directly to
selected open-source models as input, doing so is not feasible for proprietary
models. On the other hand, projecting these embeddings back into valid discrete
tokens introduces additional complexity and often reduces attack effectiveness.
We propose an intrinsic optimization method which directly optimizes relaxed
one-hot encodings of the adversarial suffix tokens using exponentiated gradient
descent coupled with Bregman projection, ensuring that the optimized one-hot
encoding of each token always remains within the probability simplex. We
provide theoretical proof of convergence for our proposed method and implement
an efficient algorithm that effectively jailbreaks several widely used LLMs.
Our method achieves higher success rates and faster convergence compared to
three state-of-the-art baselines, evaluated on five open-source LLMs and four
adversarial behavior datasets curated for evaluating jailbreak methods. In
addition to individual prompt attacks, we also generate universal adversarial
suffixes effective across multiple prompts and demonstrate transferability of
optimized suffixes to different LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图学习中存在两个主要挑战：有效表示未见节点和减轻噪声或冗余图信息

Method: 提出GTGIB框架，整合图结构学习(GSL)和时序图信息瓶颈(TGIB)，设计两步GSL结构增强器优化节点邻域，通过变分近似推导可处理的TGIB目标函数

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的链接预测任务中，GTGIB在归纳设置下优于所有现有方法，在转导设置下也有显著且一致的改进

Conclusion: GTGIB框架通过结合结构学习和信息瓶颈原则，有效解决了时序图学习中的节点表示和噪声过滤问题

Abstract: Temporal graph learning is crucial for dynamic networks where nodes and edges
evolve over time and new nodes continuously join the system. Inductive
representation learning in such settings faces two major challenges:
effectively representing unseen nodes and mitigating noisy or redundant graph
information. We propose GTGIB, a versatile framework that integrates Graph
Structure Learning (GSL) with Temporal Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). We
design a novel two-step GSL-based structural enhancer to enrich and optimize
node neighborhoods and demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency through
theoretical proofs and experiments. The TGIB refines the optimized graph by
extending the information bottleneck principle to temporal graphs, regularizing
both edges and features based on our derived tractable TGIB objective function
via variational approximation, enabling stable and efficient optimization.
GTGIB-based models are evaluated to predict links on four real-world datasets;
they outperform existing methods in all datasets under the inductive setting,
with significant and consistent improvement in the transductive setting.

Method: 研究在线价值基深度RL中模型容量和更新到数据比例(UTD)这两个计算分配轴的交互作用，分析不同批处大小和模型规模的影响

Result: 发现了TD过拟合现象：小模型中增加批处大小会快速对Q函数准确性造成害处，但大模型中没有这种效应，允许有效使用大批处大小

Conclusion: 提供了选择批处大小和UTD比例以优化计算使用的指南，为深度RL的计算最优扩展提供了基础

Abstract: As models grow larger and training them becomes expensive, it becomes
increasingly important to scale training recipes not just to larger models and
more data, but to do so in a compute-optimal manner that extracts maximal
performance per unit of compute. While such scaling has been well studied for
language modeling, reinforcement learning (RL) has received less attention in
this regard. In this paper, we investigate compute scaling for online,
value-based deep RL. These methods present two primary axes for compute
allocation: model capacity and the update-to-data (UTD) ratio. Given a fixed
compute budget, we ask: how should resources be partitioned across these axes
to maximize sample efficiency? Our analysis reveals a nuanced interplay between
model size, batch size, and UTD. In particular, we identify a phenomenon we
call TD-overfitting: increasing the batch quickly harms Q-function accuracy for
small models, but this effect is absent in large models, enabling effective use
of large batch size at scale. We provide a mental model for understanding this
phenomenon and build guidelines for choosing batch size and UTD to optimize
compute usage. Our findings provide a grounded starting point for
compute-optimal scaling in deep RL, mirroring studies in supervised learning
but adapted to TD learning.

*Jing Leng,Sanjukta Roy*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 研究室友匹配问题中同时考虑房间和室友偏好的稳定性、效率和策略防护性，提出了串行独裁算法实现4人稳定分配，分析了TTC算法的局限性，并识别了多项式时间内可找到2人稳定分配的特殊偏好结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统室友匹配问题主要关注室友偏好，但现实中人们既关心与谁同住也关心住在哪个房间。Chan等人最近开始研究这种双重偏好模型，需要深入探讨不同稳定性概念与效率、策略防护性的关系

Method: 使用串行独裁算法寻找4人稳定分配，分析TTC算法的变体，识别特殊偏好结构来多项式时间内求解2人稳定分配问题

Result: 串行独裁算法能产生帕累托最优且策略防护的4人稳定分配，但无法保证2人稳定性；TTC变体无法同时满足策略防护性和帕累托最优；在特定偏好结构下可在多项式时间内找到2人稳定分配

Conclusion: 4人稳定性与效率、策略防护性可以兼容，但2人稳定性更具挑战性，需要在特定条件下才能高效求解，为实际室友分配提供了理论指导

Abstract: In the roommate matching model, given a set of 2n agents and n rooms, we find
an assignment of a pair of agents to a room. Although the roommate matching
problem is well studied, the study of the model when agents have preference
over both rooms and roommates was recently initiated by Chan et al. [11]. We
study two types of stable roommate assignments, namely, 4-person stable (4PS)
and 2-person stable (2PS) in conjunction with efficiency and
strategy-proofness. We design a simple serial dictatorship based algorithm for
finding a 4PS assignment that is Pareto optimal and strategy-proof. However,
the serial dictatorship algorithm is far from being 2PS. Next, we study top
trading cycle (TTC) based algorithms. We show that variations of TTC cannot be
strategy-proof or PO. Finally, as Chan et al. (2016) showed that deciding the
existence of 2PS assignment is NP-complete, we identify preference structures
where a 2PS assignment can be found in polynomial time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信息设计中的最优信号方案往往包含难以审计或沟通的非解释性随机化或断开的状态空间分区，需要设计更简单可解释的信号方案。

Method: 提出使用确定性单调K-分区信号方案，开发技术工具将任意最优信号方案转换为分区方案并获得1/2效用，研究计算复杂性和近似算法。

Result: 证明可解释性代价最差为1/2，精确优化是NP难问题，但对Lipschitz效用函数有多项式时间近似算法，对分段常数效用函数有匹配1/2界限的有效算法。

Conclusion: 分区信号方案在可解释性和性能之间提供了良好权衡，虽然存在计算复杂性，但针对特定效用函数类别可以高效计算近似最优解。

Abstract: The optimal signaling schemes in information design (Bayesian persuasion)
problems often involve non-explainable randomization or disconnected partitions
of state space, which are too intricate to be audited or communicated. We
propose explainable information design in the context of information design
with a continuous state space, restricting the information designer to use
$K$-partitional signaling schemes defined by deterministic and monotone
partitions of the state space, where a unique signal is sent for all states in
each part. We first prove that the price of explainability (PoE) -- the ratio
between the performances of the optimal explainable signaling scheme and
unrestricted signaling scheme -- is exactly $1/2$ in the worst case, meaning
that partitional signaling schemes are never worse than arbitrary signaling
schemes by a factor of 2.
  We then study the complexity of computing optimal explainable signaling
schemes. We show that the exact optimization problem is NP-hard in general. But
for Lipschitz utility functions, an $\varepsilon$-approximately optimal
explainable signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time. And for
piecewise constant utility functions, we provide an efficient algorithm to find
an explainable signaling scheme that provides a $1/2$ approximation to the
optimal unrestricted signaling scheme, which matches the worst-case PoE bound.
  A technical tool we develop is a conversion from any optimal signaling scheme
(which satisfies a bi-pooling property) to a partitional signaling scheme that
achieves $1/2$ fraction of the expected utility of the former. We use this tool
in the proofs of both our PoE result and algorithmic result.

Abstract: We study the task of electing egalitarian sequences of $\tau$ committees
given a set of agents with additive utilities for candidates available on each
of $\tau$ levels. We introduce several rules for electing an egalitarian
committee sequence as well as properties for such rules. We settle the
computational complexity of finding a winning sequence for our rules and
classify them against our properties. Additionally, we transform sequential
election data from existing election data from the literature. Using this data
set, we compare our rules empirically and test them experimentally against our
properties.

Abstract: We study payoff manipulation in repeated multi-objective Stackelberg games,
where a leader may strategically influence a follower's deterministic best
response, e.g., by offering a share of their own payoff. We assume that the
follower's utility function, representing preferences over multiple objectives,
is unknown but linear, and its weight parameter must be inferred through
interaction. This introduces a sequential decision-making challenge for the
leader, who must balance preference elicitation with immediate utility
maximisation. We formalise this problem and propose manipulation policies based
on expected utility (EU) and long-term expected utility (longEU), which guide
the leader in selecting actions and offering incentives that trade off
short-term gains with long-term impact. We prove that under infinite repeated
interactions, longEU converges to the optimal manipulation. Empirical results
across benchmark environments demonstrate that our approach improves cumulative
leader utility while promoting mutually beneficial outcomes, all without
requiring explicit negotiation or prior knowledge of the follower's utility
function.

*Hangming Zhang,Zheng Li,Qiang Yu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的ANN到SNN转换方法PMSM，通过极性多脉冲映射和信息熵分析，实现了单时间步长下的近乎无损转换，在多个数据集上达到了最先进的准确率，同时显著降低了能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ANN到SNN转换方法存在信息损失问题，无法在超低延迟（单时间步长）下实现无损转换，且对超参数配置敏感，导致性能下降。

Method: 通过信息熵分析量化层的信息损失，提出极性多脉冲映射(PMSM)和针对量化层的超参数调整策略，利用SNN的时间动态特性。

Result: 在ViT-S架构上，仅用1个时间步长就达到了CIFAR-10 98.5%、CIFAR-100 89.3%、ImageNet 81.6%的准确率，相比基线方法在VGG-16上能耗降低5倍以上。

Conclusion: PMSM方法首次实现了单时间步长下的近乎无损ANN到SNN转换，为高效转换设立了新基准，显著提升了计算效率和能耗表现。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer advantages in computational efficiency
via event-driven computing, compared to traditional artificial neural networks
(ANNs). While direct training methods tackle the challenge of
non-differentiable activation mechanisms in SNNs, they often suffer from high
computational and energy costs during training. As a result, ANN-to-SNN
conversion approach still remains a valuable and practical alternative. These
conversion-based methods aim to leverage the discrete output produced by the
quantization layer to obtain SNNs with low latency. Although the theoretical
minimum latency is one timestep, existing conversion methods have struggled to
realize such ultra-low latency without accuracy loss. Moreover, current
quantization approaches often discard negative-value information following
batch normalization and are highly sensitive to the hyperparameter
configuration, leading to degraded performance. In this work, we, for the first
time, analyze the information loss introduced by quantization layers through
the lens of information entropy. Building on our analysis, we introduce
Polarity Multi-Spike Mapping (PMSM) and a hyperparameter adjustment strategy
tailored for the quantization layer. Our method achieves nearly lossless
ANN-to-SNN conversion at the extremity, i.e., the first timestep, while also
leveraging the temporal dynamics of SNNs across multiple timesteps to maintain
stable performance on complex tasks. Experimental results show that our PMSM
achieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 98.5% on CIFAR-10, 89.3% on CIFAR-100
and 81.6% on ImageNet with only one timestep on ViT-S architecture,
establishing a new benchmark for efficient conversion. In addition, our method
reduces energy consumption by over 5x under VGG-16 on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100,
compared to the baseline method.
