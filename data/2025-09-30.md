### [1] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATS是一个紧凑的行为审计框架，用于评估视觉语言模型拒绝视觉矛盾陈述的能力，揭示了生成式VLMs在空间一致性方面的系统性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基准测试可能掩盖系统性的失败，降低实际应用中的可信度，因此需要开发能够测量模型拒绝视觉矛盾陈述能力的审计方法。

Method: 引入MATS框架，包含空间一致性得分(SCS)和错误同意率(IAR)两个指标，并使用激活修补技术因果定位失败位置。

Result: 指令调优的生成式VLMs(如LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat)表现出极低的SCS和高的IAR，而对比编码器(如CLIP, SigLIP)则更加稳健。

Conclusion: 生成式VLMs在空间一致性方面存在系统性缺陷，激活修补技术能够识别失败的具体位置，为模型修复提供了具体路径。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

### [2] [Scale and Rotation Estimation of Similarity-Transformed Images via Cross-Correlation Maximization Based on Auxiliary Function Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22686)
*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种高效算法，能够以亚像素精度联合估计两幅图像之间的尺度和旋转变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统相位相关技术在处理图像平移偏移时有效，但在处理相机缩放或旋转引起的尺度和旋转变化时表现不足。

Method: 基于对数极坐标傅里叶变换与交叉相关最大化策略，结合辅助函数方法，通过亚像素级交叉相关实现精确估计。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在尺度和旋转估计上的平均误差低于传统的基于离散交叉相关的傅里叶变换技术。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够有效解决图像配准中的尺度和旋转估计问题，具有较高的精度和实用性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

### [3] [Robust Object Detection for Autonomous Driving via Curriculum-Guided Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22688)
*Xu Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合课程学习数据调度和难度感知过滤的强化学习框架，用于增强多模态大语言模型在结构化感知任务中的定位精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言推理方面表现出色，但在需要精确定位和鲁棒性的结构化感知任务中表现不佳。

Method: 基于Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)的强化学习框架，结合课程学习数据调度和难度感知过滤，通过奖励设计、KL正则化和课程进度控制来稳定优化过程。

Result: 在自动驾驶基准测试中显示出检测精度和鲁棒性的显著提升，消融研究证实了奖励设计、KL正则化和课程进度对收敛稳定性和泛化能力的重要性。

Conclusion: 基于结构化数据课程的强化驱动优化是实现鲁棒和可解释多模态检测的可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

### [4] [Graph-Theoretic Consistency for Robust and Topology-Aware Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22689)
*Ha-Hieu Pham,Minh Le,Han Huynh,Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出拓扑图一致性(TGC)框架，通过拉普拉斯谱对齐、组件计数和邻接统计来增强半监督语义分割的拓扑有效性，在5-10%监督下达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督语义分割中像素级一致性方法传播噪声伪标签、产生碎片化或拓扑无效掩码的问题，特别是在计算病理学中密集标注成本高昂且有限的场景下。

Method: 提出拓扑图一致性(TGC)框架，通过图论约束对齐预测图和参考图之间的拉普拉斯谱、组件计数和邻接统计，强制执行全局拓扑结构。

Result: 在GlaS和CRAG数据集上的实验表明，TGC在5-10%监督下达到最先进性能，显著缩小了与全监督方法的差距。

Conclusion: TGC通过集成图论约束有效提升了半监督语义分割的拓扑质量和分割精度，为计算病理学等标注成本高的领域提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at
https://github.com/hieuphamha19/TGC.

### [5] [A review of Recent Techniques for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22690)
*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文是一篇关于行人重识别技术的综述论文，重点比较了监督学习和无监督学习方法的发展现状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督学习方法在行人重识别中取得了显著进展，但依赖大量标注数据，存在可扩展性和计算成本问题。无监督方法利用未标注数据，近年来性能差距逐渐缩小，显示出巨大潜力。

Method: 采用双焦点综述方法：首先回顾和分类监督学习行人重识别的重要文献，其次探索过去三年无监督学习的最新进展。

Result: 监督学习方法已接近性能极限，改进空间有限；无监督学习方法在近年来发展迅速，性能与监督方法的差距正在缩小。

Conclusion: 该综述捕捉了监督学习技术的成熟现状和无监督学习领域的潜力，为行人重识别技术的演进提供了全面视角。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [6] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Sequential Token Merging (STM)方法，通过双向最近邻合并和隐藏状态保护来解决Vision Mambas中token数量随图像分辨率二次增长的问题，在保持精度的同时显著减少计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mambas虽然具有亚二次复杂度，但其效率仍受限于token数量随图像分辨率的二次增长。现有方法解决了token冗余问题，但忽略了ViMs内在的有限方向序列依赖性(LDSD)这一关键信息流机制。

Method: 1) 双向最近邻合并：通过对称空间聚合保持序列依赖性；2) 隐藏状态保护：稳定类别token周围的隐藏状态。STM策略性地利用Mamba的逐层损失收敛，将时间遗忘转化为稳定性。

Result: 实验表明STM的优越性：ViM-Ti在减少20% token时准确率仅下降1.0%，ViM-S在减少40% token时仅下降1.4%。该方法以最小复杂度实现了最先进的效率。

Conclusion: STM方法有效解决了Vision Mambas的token扩展问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率，并为状态空间模型动态提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习技术的发展和对高质量视觉应用需求的增长，超分辨率领域发展迅速。现有的大多数综述都专注于特定领域，缺乏对该领域的全面概述。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will
serve as a valuable resource and offer guidance to researchers in this domain.
To facilitate access to related work, we created a dedicated repository

### [8] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP风格对比学习框架的视觉语言模型，用于高光谱图像场景理解，仅更新0.07%的参数即可实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据需求增长，高效学习越来越依赖于高质量数据的筛选和提炼。高光谱图像具有高维3D体素结构，其跨模态对齐问题尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 使用CLIP风格对比训练框架，将视觉主干网络的体素级嵌入映射到冻结大嵌入模型的潜在空间，通过可训练探针对齐视觉特征与文本标记表示，使用硬负样本和半硬负样本进行对比学习，并引入描述性提示作为结构化锚点。

Result: 在Indian Pines数据集上比单模态和多模态基线方法OA提升+0.92，Kappa提升+1.60；在Pavia University数据集上OA提升+0.69，Kappa提升+0.90，参数量比DCTN少50倍，比SS-TMNet少90倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过极少的参数更新实现了高光谱图像场景理解的最先进性能，证明了高效跨模态对齐的有效性。

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GPR-NIAM方法，通过注意力隔离和跨模态知识对齐实现单轮联邦提示学习，在数据异构环境下提升跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦提示学习方法依赖多轮通信，而单轮联邦学习方法缺乏跨任务泛化能力，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 使用注意力隔离模块限制可学习提示与原始文本嵌入的过度交互，并通过跨模态协作精炼模块整合分散的视觉知识。

Result: 在10个基准数据集上的实验表明，GPR-NIAM在类别级和领域级泛化方面优于8种最先进方法。

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM通过创新的注意力机制和知识对齐策略，有效实现了单轮联邦提示学习的跨任务泛化。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GZSL-MoE模型，将混合专家层集成到生成式零样本学习框架中，用于3D点云语义分割，在COVERED数据集上实现了对未见类别的有效识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D点云语义分割中训练数据不完整的问题，特别是当无法获取所有对象类别的全面训练数据时，通过生成式零样本学习来识别未见类别。

Method: 在生成器和判别器中集成混合专家层，使用预训练的KPConv模型提取特征，生成与真实特征相似的伪特征，应用于COVERED数据集的人机协作环境。

Result: GZSL-MoE模型在可见和未见类别上都表现出性能提升，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GZSL-MoE为理解复杂3D环境提供了一种有前景的解决方案，特别是在训练数据不完整的情况下。

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

### [11] [IBiT: Utilizing Inductive Biases to Create a More Data Efficient Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22719)
*Adithya Giri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IBiT方法，通过引入学习掩码为Vision Transformers添加归纳偏置，使其能在小数据集上有效学习而无需知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在计算机视觉中占主导地位，但缺乏卷积神经网络的归纳偏置，这在大数据集上可学习，但在小数据集上表现不佳。

Method: 通过学习的掩码为Vision Transformers引入归纳偏置，称为Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT)。

Result: IBiT在小数据集上显著更准确，同时保持了Transformer的可解释性。

Conclusion: 通过引入学习掩码的归纳偏置，Vision Transformers可以在小数据集上有效学习，无需知识蒸馏。

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutAgent是一个结合视觉语言推理和组合扩散的智能框架，用于生成符合语义关系和物理合理性的多目标场景空间布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏显式空间推理导致布局不现实，而传统机器人空间规划方法难以捕捉视觉场景的语义丰富性，需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 首先使用视觉语言模型进行输入预处理（分割、物体尺寸估计、场景图构建、提示重写），然后利用组合扩散合成符合场景图对象关系的边界框，最后通过前景条件图像生成器渲染完整场景。

Result: 实验表明LayoutAgent在布局连贯性、空间真实性和美学对齐方面优于其他最先进的布局生成模型。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将视觉语言推理与组合扩散相结合，实现了更真实的多目标场景布局生成。

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompareBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型视觉比较推理能力的基准测试，包含1000个QA对，涵盖数量、时间、几何和空间四个任务。测试发现即使最强模型在时间排序、空间关系和基础计数方面仍存在系统性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉比较推理是视觉语言模型的基本但研究不足的技能，需要专门的基准测试来评估和推动该能力的发展。

Method: 构建CompareBench基准，包含1000个QA对，分为数量(600)、时间(100)、几何(200)和空间(100)四个任务。基于两个辅助数据集TallyBench(2000张计数图像)和HistCaps(515张历史图像)。评估了闭源API和开源模型。

Result: 结果显示明显的扩展趋势，但模型在时间排序和空间关系方面持续失败，在基础计数和几何比较中经常犯错，这些对人类来说很简单。当前VLMs在视觉比较方面存在系统性盲点。

Conclusion: CompareBench通过提供受控、多样化和诊断性评估，为推进更可靠的多模态推理奠定了基础，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在视觉比较推理方面的关键局限性。

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

Motivation: 现有的两阶段3D生成方法（先生成几何再合成外观）存在几何-纹理不对齐和计算成本高的问题，需要更高效的统一生成方案。

Method: 提出几何-外观统一VAE，将高分辨率稀疏特征压缩为紧凑的UniLat潜在表示；训练单一流匹配模型，直接从高斯噪声映射到UniLat。

Conclusion: UniLat3D通过统一的潜在表示和单阶段生成流程，有效解决了传统两阶段方法的对齐问题和效率问题，实现了快速高质量的3D资产生成。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MILR是一种在测试时联合推理图像和文本的方法，通过在统一潜在向量空间中搜索离散标记的向量表示来实现跨模态推理，无需高质量推理数据进行微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于推理的图像生成方法要么局限于单一模态（图像或文本），要么依赖高质量推理数据进行微调，存在局限性。

Method: 在统一多模态理解和生成（MUG）框架中实现，使用策略梯度方法在统一潜在空间中搜索图像和文本标记的向量表示，由图像质量评估器指导。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和WISE基准测试中均达到最先进水平，在知识密集型WISE上总体得分0.63，比基线提高80%。

Conclusion: 在统一潜在空间中进行联合推理是MILR强大性能的关键，该方法在时间和文化推理方面展现出非凡能力。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

*Tangqi Shi,Pietro Lio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UESA-Net网络，通过多方向收缩注意力机制在超声图像中实现乳腺和甲状腺病变的精确分割，在两个公开数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声成像虽然成本效益高，但存在斑点噪声、结构重叠和全局-局部特征交互弱的问题。现有网络难以平衡高级语义和低级空间细节，需要开发能够弥合全局上下文与局部细节语义差距的分割框架。

Method: 采用U形网络架构，编码器-解码器结构捕获长程依赖性和细粒度结构。编码块中沿水平、垂直和深度方向的注意力模块利用空间细节，收缩策略整合先验知识和局部特征。解码器采用成对收缩机制，结合低级物理线索和编码器特征增强上下文建模。

Result: 在TN3K（3493张图像）和BUSI（780张图像）两个公开数据集上，UESA-Net分别实现了0.8487和0.6495的交并比（IoU）得分，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: UESA-Net通过有效聚合多方向空间信息和先验知识，提高了乳腺和甲状腺超声分割的鲁棒性和准确性，在多个基准测试中表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: PartCo是一个新的广义类别发现框架，通过引入部分级视觉特征对应关系来增强类别发现能力，能够无缝集成到现有方法中并显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要依赖语义标签和全局图像表示，忽略了区分密切相关类别所需的关键部分级线索。

Method: 提出PartCo框架，利用部分级视觉特征对应关系来捕捉更细粒度的语义结构，从而更细致地理解类别关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，PartCo显著提升了当前GCD方法的性能，达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: PartCo通过弥合语义标签和部分级视觉组合之间的差距，为GCD设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

TL;DR: DEFT是一种分解式高效微调框架，通过将预训练权重矩阵的更新分解为两个可训练矩阵组件，在保持编辑能力的同时实现个性化学习和多任务统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像模型高效微调中在目标分布对齐、从有限图像学习新概念、保持指令能力以及维持编辑性之间的平衡挑战。

Method: 将预训练权重矩阵更新分解为两个组件：在低秩子空间补集上的投影和低秩更新，使用两个可训练低秩矩阵分别定义子空间和实现参数适配。

Result: 在Dreambooth、Dreambench Plus、InsDet和VisualCloze数据集上的实验表明，该方法在个性化和通用图像生成方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DEFT框架展示了高效微调的新兴特性，在保持模型编辑能力的同时实现了有效的参数适应。

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评估方法局限于单一不透明分数，缺乏可解释性，无法全面捕捉视频质量评估的多方面特性。

Method: 使用包含27,168个人工标注视频的大规模数据集VideoFeedback2，采用监督微调后接GRPO强化学习的两阶段训练流程。

Result: 在VideoScore-Bench-v2基准上达到44.35准确率（提升5.94），在四个跨域基准上平均性能为50.37（提升4.32）。

Conclusion: VideoScore2提供了可解释的评估，通过有效的奖励建模弥合了评估与可控生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between
evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for

TL;DR: TRUST是一种针对状态空间模型（SSMs）的测试时自适应方法，通过利用多种遍历排列生成输入的多个因果视角，使用模型预测作为伪标签来更新Mamba特定参数，从而提升模型在分布偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型（SSMs）作为视觉Transformer的高效替代方案，在分布偏移下泛化性能显著下降，需要专门的自适应方法来提升鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TRUST方法：1）使用多样化的遍历排列生成输入的多个因果视角；2）利用模型预测作为伪标签指导Mamba特定参数的更新；3）通过平均适应权重整合不同遍历扫描中学到的信息。

Result: 在七个基准测试上的实验表明，TRUST能够持续提升鲁棒性，并优于现有的测试时自适应方法。

Conclusion: TRUST是首个明确利用SSMs独特架构特性进行自适应的方法，为状态空间模型在分布偏移下的性能提升提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMPB是首个用于评估视觉语言模型个性化能力的大规模基准，包含10k图像-查询对和111个个性化概念，涵盖人类、动物、物体和角色四个类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在个性化适应方面研究不足，而视觉个性化对于面向用户的AI系统（如智能家居和医疗保健）至关重要。

Method: 构建包含10k图像-查询对的基准，将个性化分为三种任务类型，使用23个广泛使用的VLM模型，通过三阶段协议（概念注入、多轮对话、个性化查询）进行评估。

Result: 大多数VLM（包括一些闭源模型）在个性化方面表现不佳，特别是在保持对话一致性、处理用户偏好和适应视觉线索方面存在困难。

Conclusion: VLM个性化存在显著改进空间（如拒绝行为和长上下文遗忘），MMPB为未来真正个性化的多模态AI研究提供了宝贵见解和坚实基础。

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全可控的对抗性补丁生成框架，允许攻击者自由选择输入图像和目标类别，实现精确的误分类控制。该方法结合生成式U-Net设计和Grad-CAM引导的补丁放置，在保持视觉真实性的同时最大化攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性补丁攻击方法大多依赖不切实际的白盒假设、非定向目标，或产生视觉上明显的补丁，限制了实际应用。需要开发一种既保持视觉真实性又具有黑盒适用性的定向攻击方法。

Method: 结合生成式U-Net架构和Grad-CAM引导的语义感知补丁放置策略，实现对抗性补丁的精确生成和定位。

Result: 在卷积网络（DenseNet-121、ResNet-50）和视觉变换器（ViT-B/16、Swin-B/16等）上的广泛实验表明，该方法在所有设置下都达到最先进性能，攻击成功率（ASR）和目标类别成功率（TCS）均超过99%。

Conclusion: 该框架在真实性、定向控制和黑盒适用性这三个最具挑战性的维度上同时确保性能，为对抗性鲁棒性研究建立了新基准，弥合了理论攻击强度与实际隐蔽性之间的差距。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

Motivation: 传统的时间显著性检测后处理方法计算成本高，而现有声称可解释的模型往往在标准基准测试中表现不佳。需要一种既能提供时间显著性解释又能保持强大预测性能的方法。

Method: 提出CrossScaleNet架构，结合基于补丁的跨注意力机制和多尺度处理，在训练过程中嵌入注意力机制来提供内在的时间显著性解释。

Result: 在合成数据集和公共基准测试中验证了方法的鲁棒性。在真实世界预测任务中，持续优于大多数基于Transformer的模型，在不牺牲预测准确性的情况下提供更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet填补了现有模型的空白，提供了一种平衡的方法，能有效捕捉时间显著性，同时在各种复杂度的数据集上实现最先进的预测性能。

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

Motivation: 肺癌是全球癌症相关死亡的主要原因，准确描绘PET/CT成像中的内部肿瘤体积对移动肿瘤的放射治疗至关重要，但面临标注数据稀缺和肿瘤边界PET信号强度衰减的挑战。

Method: 采用迁移学习方法，在大量肿瘤体积数据集上预训练多模态交互感知网络，然后在私有内部肿瘤体积数据集上微调；引入切片交互模块来建模切片间关系，解决边界切片PET信号弱的问题。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了迁移学习结合先进多模态技术和切片交互模块在提升肺癌放射治疗计划中内部肿瘤体积分割可靠性和临床相关性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic
range. However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based
vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present
ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize
high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text
labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the
diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based
on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based
generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习型方法需要大量训练数据且在某些器官类型和成像模态上精度不足，而基于INR的方法虽然精度高但需要实例特定优化，计算效率和稳定性是关键问题。

Method: 将KANs集成到INR-based可变形图像配准中，提出随机基函数采样策略减少所需基函数数量，保持配准质量的同时显著降低计算成本。

Result: 在三个不同数据集（肺CT、脑MRI、心脏MRI）上评估，KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR在所有评估模态和解剖结构中达到INR-based方法中最高的精度，计算开销最小，学习稳定性最佳。

Conclusion: RandKAN-IDIR模型在随机基函数采样下略优于可学习基函数索引模型，同时消除了额外的训练时间复杂性，为医学图像配准提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

Conclusion: CST提供了一种端到端的集合图像处理解决方案，在性能和可解释性方面均优于现有方法，支持预训练和迁移学习。

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal
features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections
from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a
stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution
detection head, (3) cascaded coordinate attention blocks, and (4) a branch
pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20
different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5
IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123
FPS on a single GPU. Cross-dataset validation on a fifth dataset further
confirms strong generalization capability. Additional results and resources are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅的参数化表示在神经网络中难以学习，存在非唯一性和异构性问题，导致模型高度依赖数据。需要一种能保持颜色和几何结构、同时确保唯一映射和通道同质性的表示方法。

Result: 该方法为3D高斯泼溅的学习提供了更有效的表示形式。

Conclusion: 提出的嵌入表示方法能够更好地支持3D高斯泼溅在神经网络中的学习。

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

Motivation: 解决一步生成器存在的两个关键限制：继承教师模型的建模偏差，以及离散令牌输出阻碍梯度流动，无法进行后蒸馏精炼。

Method: 引入软嵌入方法，将离散令牌替换为生成器输出分布下的期望嵌入，保持表示保真度的同时提供完全可微的连续代理，集成到Di[M]O蒸馏框架中形成Soft-Di[M]O。

Conclusion: 软嵌入方法使一步生成器具备端到端可训练性，支持多种精炼技术，显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

Abstract: Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of
incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for
few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers
the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent
marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot
deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

Motivation: 开发稳健的AI解决方案用于颅内出血(ICH)的及时诊断受到公共数据碎片化的阻碍，需要统一的高质量数据集。

Method: 构建包含372个头部CT检查的数据集，采用双读工作流程和神经外科医生裁决来确保标注质量，使用标准卷积和transformer架构进行基准测试。

Result: 轻量级模型MobileViT-XS在二分类中达到87.8%的F1分数，U-Net with DenseNet161编码器在病变分割中达到85.5%的Dice分数。

Conclusion: Hemorica提供了一个统一、细粒度的基准数据集，支持多任务和课程学习，促进AI辅助ICH检测和量化系统的设计。

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

Conclusion: ARSS框架证明了自回归模型在视角合成任务中的有效性，为世界建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

Motivation: 动作识别模型过度依赖静态线索而非动态人体运动（静态偏差），导致在现实应用和零样本动作识别中性能不佳

Method: 使用偏置流和无偏流之间的统计独立性损失，结合场景预测损失

Result: 实验证明该方法有效减少静态偏差，并确认了场景预测损失的重要性

Conclusion: 通过分离动态和静态信息的方法能够有效缓解动作识别中的静态偏差问题

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于场景复杂性、传感器不准确性和处理不精确性，点云损坏不可避免。深度神经网络对输入特征的过度依赖是导致其脆弱性的根本原因，但尚不清楚这种问题是否存在于涉及点云的3D任务中，以及减少对这些特征的依赖是否能增强模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DesenAT方法：1）使用Shapley值量化DNN对点云特征的敏感性；2）通过消除高贡献成分的数据点和使用空间变换模拟损坏场景来生成对抗样本；3）在自蒸馏框架中进行对抗训练，将干净样本的知识转移到对抗样本，以补偿信息损失。

Result: 在ModelNet-C和PointCloud-C数据集上的广泛实验表明，所提出的方法能够有效提高模型的鲁棒性，同时不会降低在干净数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证实了深度神经网络在3D点云任务中存在对输入特征的过度依赖问题，提出的DesenAT方法通过平滑敏感性有效缓解了这一问题，显著提升了模型对损坏点云的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

*Xiafeng Man,Zhipeng Wei,Jingjing Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出D-Plus-Minus (DPM)框架，基于差分隐私理论检测文本到图像扩散模型中的版权侵权，无需原始训练数据即可可靠识别侵权内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉模型（如Stable Diffusion）可能记忆并复制受版权保护内容，现有检测方法缺乏鲁棒性和理论支撑，需要解决这一法律和伦理问题。

Method: 基于差分隐私理论提出条件敏感度指标，通过微调模型进行学习和反学习来模拟数据包含/排除过程，使用统计指标在正交提示分布上计算置信度分数。

Result: DPM能够可靠检测侵权内容，无需访问原始训练数据集或文本提示，为生成AI时代的知识产权保护提供可解释的实用解决方案。

Conclusion: 该工作为版权侵权检测提供了理论基础和实用框架，构建的CIDD数据集为标准化基准测试提供了资源，有助于保护生成AI时代的知识产权。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

Conclusion: 提供了基于统计分析的目标指南，指导在低剂量CT去噪中有效使用感知损失，通过优化感知损失设计可获得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于轻量级多模态预训练变换器Presto的传感器灵活洪水检测方法，能够处理SAR、多光谱或两者结合的数据，在Sen1Floods11数据集上表现优于大型基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水灾害日益频繁，需要快速准确的洪水淹没制图。现有单传感器方法受天气和数据可用性限制，多传感器融合方法需要大量计算资源和标注数据。

Method: 通过微调轻量级多模态预训练变换器Presto（约0.4M参数），处理SAR和多光谱数据的像素级洪水检测，支持单一传感器或组合输入。

Result: 在最优传感器融合场景下F1得分0.896，mIoU 0.886，优于Prithvi-100M基准。在多光谱单独场景下F1 0.893，SAR单独场景下F1 0.718，表现稳健。

Conclusion: 这种参数高效、传感器灵活的方法为实际灾害场景提供了可访问且稳健的解决方案，能够立即评估洪水范围而不受传感器可用性限制。

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

*Jingxing Li,Yongjae Lee,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeLoc3r通过几何一致性正则化(GCR)增强姿态回归方法，在训练时利用深度信息生成密集3D-2D对应关系，通过加权RANSAC计算几何一致姿态作为一致性损失，从而在保持ReLoc3R快速推理速度的同时接近MASt3R的高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ReLoc3R内部表示的几何不一致性问题，克服回归方法与基于对应关系方法之间的速度-精度权衡困境。

Method: 训练时使用真实深度生成密集3D-2D对应关系，通过FusionTransformer学习对应关系重要性，使用加权RANSAC计算几何一致姿态作为一致性损失来训练回归网络。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著超越ReLoc3R：CO3Dv2数据集AUC@5°从34.85%提升到40.45%(相对提升16%)，RealEstate10K从66.70%提升到68.66%，MegaDepth1500从49.60%提升到50.45%。

Conclusion: GeLoc3r通过在训练而非推理时教授几何一致性，实现了回归方法的速度与对应关系方法的几何理解之间的平衡，代表了神经网络学习相机几何的新范式。

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

Motivation: 需要为预训练分类器的决策提供既忠实又简洁的解释，传统方法往往无法同时保证解释的忠实性和最小化特性。

Method: 训练自编码器生成二值掩码，结合多层激活匹配（KL散度和交叉熵）、掩码先验（L1面积、二值化惩罚、总变差）和溯因约束，确保解释忠实于模型行为。

Result: 生成的小型、可解释掩码能够保留分类器行为，同时去除不相关输入区域，提供实用且忠实的简约解释。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了为模型决策生成最小化忠实解释的目标，平衡了解释的简洁性和对模型行为的忠实度。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

Method: 利用视觉语言模型进行基于提示的区域定位，应用差异化掩码强调诊断相关区域，减少背景冗余。

Result: 在脑部MRI、胸部CT和肺部X射线等多种医学影像模态上，分类准确率提升达3.1个百分点，检测任务中BoxAP提升1.3，MaskAP提升1.1，且掩码比例显著降低（40% vs 70%）。

Conclusion: 可控的文本驱动掩码能够实现语义对齐的自监督学习，推动医学图像分析中鲁棒视觉模型的发展。

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

Conclusion: FMC-DETR通过频率解耦融合有效解决了航空视角小目标检测的挑战，在保持细节的同时增强全局上下文感知，实现了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

Result: 发现大多数奖励模型能提供有效的奖励分数构建偏好数据；偏好数据在候选扩展和样本扩展中表现出稳健趋势；奖励模型存在亮度、构图和色彩方案的偏见；简单集成可缓解偏见并获得稳健结果。

Conclusion: 对齐模型在标准指标、GPT-4评估和人类评估中显著优于先前模型，无需改变模型结构或使用新数据集，为这一有前景的领域设定了简单而坚实的基准。

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is

Motivation: 现有基础模型在计算病理学中参数庞大、处理要求高，难以在临床环境中部署。需要开发轻量级模型来降低计算需求。

Method: 采用跨放大倍数蒸馏框架，包含双重知识转移（全局图像表示和局部空间标记映射对齐），使用紧凑骨干网络在5x放大倍数下运行，训练了349万张图像。

Result: 在六个临床相关组织病理学分析任务中，诊断准确率仅比大型基础模型低1%，处理速度达到每分钟8.8张全切片图像，加速30倍，跨机构验证显示良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨放大倍数蒸馏是资源受限临床环境中部署基础模型能力的可行方法，有望实现实时病理AI集成。

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch是一个零样本参考图像分割框架，通过利用模型内部组件增强文本和图像的空间表示，无需额外训练即可显著提升空间定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基础视觉语言模型（如CLIP）擅长图像-文本对齐，但在理解空间关系方面表现不佳。现有方法在语言流中主要关注主要名词短语，忽略了上下文标记；在视觉流中，CLIP对具有不同空间布局的图像生成相似特征，导致空间结构敏感性有限。

Method: CoPatch框架在语言方面构建混合文本特征，整合携带空间线索的上下文标记；在视觉方面，从中间层发现的新路径中提取补丁级图像特征，这些层能更好地保留空间结构。增强的特征融合到聚类的图像-文本相似性映射CoMap中，实现精确的掩码选择。

Result: CoPatch在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+、RefCOCOg和PhraseCut数据集上显著提升了零样本参考图像分割的空间定位能力（提升2-7 mIoU），且无需任何额外训练。

Conclusion: 研究强调了恢复和利用视觉语言模型中固有但未被充分利用的空间知识的重要性，为零样本参考图像分割开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

*Emadeldeen Hamdan,Ahmet Enis Cetin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HTMA-Net结合哈达玛变换和免乘法SRAM内存计算，在保持精度的同时显著降低深度神经网络的乘法运算成本，最高可消除52%的乘法操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低乘法运算成本对边缘设备部署深度神经网络至关重要，特别是在能源受限的环境中。

Method: 通过选择性替换中间卷积层为混合哈达玛变换层，其内部卷积通过免乘法内存操作实现，结合哈达玛变换和SRAM内存计算技术。

Result: 在ResNet-18、ResNet-20和ResNet-50模型上，相比基线模型最高消除52%的乘法运算，同时保持可比较的准确率，显著降低计算复杂度和参数数量。

Conclusion: 结合结构化哈达玛变换层和SRAM内存计算免乘法操作是实现高效深度学习架构的有前景路径。

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在多样化的变化描述、计数和定位任务中缺乏深度理解和交互，需要构建新的多任务指令数据集来解决这些不足。

Method: 设计了具有双粒度感知的视觉引导视觉语言模型(ChangeVG)，采用双分支架构结合细粒度空间特征提取和高层语义总结，作为辅助提示指导大型视觉语言模型进行指令调优。

Result: 在变化描述任务上，方法在综合S*m指标上比最强方法Semantic-CC高出1.39分，该指标整合了语义相似性和描述准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的ChangeVG模型通过视觉引导模块和双粒度感知，在遥感变化理解的多任务中表现出优越性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于条件依赖耦合策略的统一多阶段生成框架，通过多阶段插值轨迹分解生成过程，在确保准确分布学习的同时实现端到端优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有图像生成模型在计算与保真度之间的权衡问题：基于VAE的模型存在信息丢失、细节有限且不支持端到端训练，而像素空间模型计算成本过高，级联模型则存在阶段分离导致的优化困难和知识共享不足。

Method: 采用条件依赖耦合策略，将生成过程分解为多阶段插值轨迹，整个过程建模为单一统一的扩散变换器，消除分离模块需求并支持知识共享。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个分辨率下均实现了高保真度和高效率。

Conclusion: 提出的统一多阶段生成框架成功解决了计算与保真度的权衡问题，实现了准确分布学习和端到端优化的统一。

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Abstract: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is essential for rapid stroke
diagnosis but is limited by low image contrast and signal to noise ratio. We
address this challenge by leveraging DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised
vision transformer, to generate powerful feature representations for a
comprehensive set of stroke analysis tasks. Our evaluation encompasses infarct

normal vs. infarct vs. hemorrhage), hemorrhage subtype classification (EDH,
SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS classification (<=6 vs. >6) on
multiple public and private datasets. This study establishes strong benchmarks
for these tasks and demonstrates the potential of advanced self-supervised
models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT, providing a clear
analysis of both the advantages and current constraints of the approach. The

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在处理需要多步骤推理和领域特定工具的复杂地球观测任务时存在局限，现有智能体方法局限于RGB感知、浅层推理且缺乏系统评估协议。

Method: 构建基于MCP工具生态系统的智能体框架，支持动态调用跨模态专家工具和模型，实现RGB和光谱数据的统一处理，进行定量时空分析。

Result: 开发了Earth-Bench基准测试，包含248个专家策划任务和13,729张图像，涵盖光谱、产品和RGB模态，通过双级评估协议验证了Earth-Agent的有效性。

Conclusion: Earth-Agent为地球观测分析建立了新范式，推动了LLMs在科学基础、下一代地球观测应用中的发展。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

Conclusion: WeatherCycle通过统一的非配对框架成功解决了多天气条件下的图像恢复问题，无需依赖特定任务的物理先验，在多样化的真实天气场景中表现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

Motivation: 解决带宽受限多媒体应用中同时实现超低比特率人体视频压缩和准确顶点预测的挑战，需要协调动态运动建模、细节外观合成和几何一致性

Method: 基于关键点的生成框架，利用极稀疏3D关键点作为传输符号，通过多任务学习和关键点感知的深度生成模型编码复杂人体运动，并估计密集运动进行视频合成

Result: 在人体视频压缩方面相比传统/生成式视频编解码器具有竞争力，同时能够为下游几何应用提供精确的人体顶点预测

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense有望促进带宽高效的人为中心媒体传输，如实时运动分析、虚拟人动画和沉浸式娱乐

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Conclusion: 这项工作为可扩展的AI驱动车轴计数系统迈出重要一步，为机器视觉替代传统路边基础设施铺平道路。

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside
infrastructure.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalSAM是一个轻量级适配框架，通过特征Fisher信息惩罚和置信度错位惩罚来提升SAM模型在医学图像分割中的领域泛化能力和校准性能，仅微调掩码解码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型在自然图像上表现出强大的零样本性能，但在医学体积图像上存在领域偏移和过度自信的问题。

Method: 提出CalSAM框架：(1) 使用特征Fisher信息惩罚降低编码器对领域偏移的敏感性；(2) 使用置信度错位惩罚惩罚过度自信的体素级错误。仅微调掩码解码器，保持SAM编码器冻结。

Result: 在跨中心和扫描仪偏移评估中显著提升准确性和校准：BraTS扫描仪分割上DSC相对提升7.4%，HD95减少26.9%，ECE减少39.5%；ATLAS-C上DSC相对提升5.3%，ECE减少32.6%。

Conclusion: CalSAM在脑MRI分割中实现了改进的领域泛化和更好的不确定性估计校准，同时保留了冻结SAM编码器的计算优势。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成数据生成、灵活时间采样和动态加权损失有效解决了无监督在线3D实例分割的挑战，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了人脸识别系统存在实际且严重的漏洞，证明即使对目标系统知识有限，也能构建出鲁棒且可转移的攻击

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI)方法，通过渐进式分离重要patch来构建稀疏合成图像，解决ViT模型反转的计算效率问题，同时保持知识转移性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏模型反转(SMI)方法在ViT上效率低下，且错误地丢弃了看似不重要的patch，而这些patch实际上可能包含可转移知识。

Method: PRI方法在反转过程中逐步分离最重要的patch构建稀疏图像，同时让剩余patch继续演化，实现知识再生的效果。

Result: PRI比标准密集模型反转(DMI)快10倍，比SMI快2倍，在准确率上优于SMI且与DMI相当。

Conclusion: PRI方法有效平衡了效率和性能，证明了渐进式patch分离策略在模型反转中的优势。

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自一致性的框架，利用模型长回答与短答案之间的不一致性自动生成偏好对进行训练，无需人工标注或外部监督即可减少幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型经常产生幻觉细节，生成不存在对象或不准确属性，影响输出可靠性。现有方法通常需要大量人工标注或更强大模型的外部监督。

Method: 设计自反思流程，通过比较详细模型响应与简洁二元答案的不一致性，自动筛选高质量训练数据。利用短二元问题的高可靠性来评估和排序生成响应。

Result: 在多个基准测试（AMBER、MultiObject-Hal、Object HalBench、MMHal-Bench）上显著改善事实基础和可靠性，同时在LLaVA-Bench和MMBench上保持强大的指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: 该方法仅依赖自一致性而非外部监督，提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，能够有效利用未标记数据减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

TL;DR: TATTOO提出了一种无需训练的美学感知服装搭配推荐方法，利用多模态大语言模型生成目标物品描述和美学链式思维，通过动态熵门控机制融合视觉和文本特征，在共享嵌入空间中进行候选物品排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时尚搭配推荐方法需要昂贵的大规模标注数据和任务特定训练，且缺乏明确的人类美学指导。在MLLM时代，可以简化为无需训练的范式，获得更好的推荐分数和美学感知能力。

Method: 使用MLLMs生成目标物品描述，通过美学链式思维将图像提炼为结构化美学档案（颜色、风格、场合、季节、材质、平衡），利用动态熵门控机制融合视觉摘要、文本描述和美学向量，在共享嵌入空间中排序候选物品。

Result: 在Aesthetic-100真实评估集上达到最先进性能，优于现有基于训练的方法。在标准Polyvore数据集上展示了先进的零样本检索能力。

Conclusion: TATTOO证明了在MLLM时代，传统基于训练的服装搭配推荐流程可以简化为无需训练的范式，同时获得更好的推荐效果和美学感知能力。

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

Motivation: 热成像在ADAS中具有优势，但面临数据集有限和模拟器代表性不足的问题。现有RGB到热成像转换方法只关注一对一映射，无法满足多样性需求。

Method: 使用多模态转换框架，提出组件感知自适应实例归一化(CoAdaIN)，与原始AdaIN的全局风格应用不同，CoAdaIN能够针对不同图像组件单独调整风格。

Result: 该方法能够生成更真实和多样化的热成像图像转换结果。

Conclusion: CoAdaIN方法在RGB到热成像图像转换中实现了更优的一对多映射效果，为ADAS系统提供了更好的热成像数据支持。

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper

Motivation: 解决稀疏视图新视角合成中的几何模糊问题，现有方法在生成完整性和几何保真度之间存在权衡：回归模型几何忠实但不完整，生成模型能补全场景但常引入结构不一致。

Method: 提出"提议-验证"框架：1) 使用预训练3D感知扩散模型合成新视图提议完整场景；2) 将多视角立体模型重新用作3D感知oracle验证生成视图的3D不确定性；3) 通过不确定性加权损失指导3D高斯溅射模型优化。

Conclusion: OracleGS成功地将强大的生成先验与多视角几何证据相结合，在稀疏视图新视角合成中实现了生成完整性与回归保真度的协调统一。

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Motivation: 随着图像到视频生成模型的快速发展，从静态图像合成视频带来了显著风险，可能被用于创建欺骗性或恶意内容。现有防御方法如I2VGuard试图免疫图像，但有效且原则性的阻止运动的保护方法仍有待探索。

Method: 提出Vid-Freeze方法，这是一种新颖的注意力抑制对抗攻击，通过向图像添加精心设计的对抗扰动，明确针对I2V模型的注意力机制，完全破坏运动合成。

Result: 实验证明该方法提供了令人印象深刻的保护效果，免疫后的图像生成静止或接近静止的视频，有效阻止恶意内容创建。

Conclusion: 注意力攻击是防止I2V生成模型滥用的一个稳健且主动防御的有前景方向。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

Conclusion: 基于离焦模糊的检测框架为媒体取证提供了物理可解释的鲁棒解决方案，有助于应对AI生成内容的挑战。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

Motivation: 传统脉冲相机重建方法在低光照高速场景下难以处理严重的噪声和稀疏信息，需要新的方法来补充纹理信息。

Method: 使用ETFI模块从低光照脉冲流中聚合稀疏信息，然后作为ControlNet的条件输入生成高速场景图像，并引入ETFI特征融合模块提升生成质量。

Result: 在真实低光照脉冲流上的性能表现优于现有方法，建立了首个低光照脉冲流重建基准数据集。

Conclusion: Diff-SPK通过结合生成先验和脉冲流特性，有效解决了低光照高速场景下的脉冲相机重建难题。

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

Conclusion: BDGF框架有效解决了多模态DDPM中的模态不平衡问题，通过扩散特征引导的多分支网络实现了更好的土地覆盖分类效果。

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

Motivation: 视觉语言模型表面上具有文化能力，但实际上依赖表面模式匹配而非真正的文化理解。需要开发诊断框架来揭示模型在文化图像推理中的系统性偏见和风险。

Method: 引入诊断框架，通过分类和解释分析来探测视觉语言模型对火主题文化图像的理解。测试多个模型在西方节日、非西方传统和紧急场景上的表现。

Result: 模型存在系统性偏见：能正确识别突出的西方节日，但在代表性不足的文化事件上表现不佳，经常提供模糊标签或危险地将紧急情况误分类为庆祝活动。

Conclusion: 这些失败暴露了符号捷径的风险，强调需要超越准确性指标的文化评估，以确保可解释和公平的多模态系统。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Conclusion: C3-OWD成功统一了鲁棒性和泛化性优势，通过课程跨模态对比学习框架在恶劣环境和开放世界场景中实现了卓越性能。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的解耦视觉推理框架，将推理与感知分离，使用LLM主导推理过程，LMM作为视觉问答引擎提供具体视觉信息，有效减少视觉无依据的推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在扩展推理链时过度依赖文本逻辑，逐渐脱离视觉信息基础，导致推理路径偏离图像内容而产生错误结论。

Method: 训练免费的视觉推理流程，核心是解耦推理和感知过程：强大的LLM负责高层推理策略，通过询问LMM来提取所需视觉信息；LMM仅作为视觉问答引擎提供感知细节。

Result: 综合评估表明该框架能有效控制视觉推理过程，显著减少视觉无依据的推理步骤，大幅提高推理保真度。

Conclusion: 这种轻量级即插即用方法无需额外训练或架构改变，就能有效解决LMMs在长推理链中视觉基础丢失的问题。

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP)框架，通过类特定的正负提示解耦语义，并引入渐进置信度解耦策略来抑制假阳性，解决了多标签类增量学习中的语义混淆和部分标签导致的真负-假正混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示的单标签类增量学习方法直接扩展到多标签类增量学习(MLCIL)时性能较差，主要面临两个内在挑战：共现类别导致的语义混淆，以及部分标签导致的真负-假正混淆。

Method: DDP框架包含类特定的正负提示来解耦语义，以及渐进置信度解耦(PCD)策略来抑制假阳性。过去的提示被冻结作为知识锚点，层间提示提高了效率。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上，DDP持续优于先前方法，是首个在标准MS-COCO B40-C10基准上超过80% mAP和70% F1的无回放MLCIL方法。

Conclusion: DDP框架有效解决了多标签类增量学习中的关键挑战，在无回放设置下取得了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10
benchmark.

TL;DR: 提出LRPO框架，首次将在线强化学习应用于盲人脸恢复任务，通过复合奖励函数、真实值引导的似然正则化和噪声级优势分配来平衡感知质量与保真度，显著提升恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人脸恢复面临大解空间探索的固有挑战，导致恢复图像出现细节缺失和身份模糊等常见伪影。传统方法难以有效平衡感知质量与保真度。

Method: LRPO框架利用在线强化学习，通过采样候选者的奖励来优化策略网络。采用三种关键策略：复合奖励函数、真实值引导的似然正则化、噪声级优势分配。

Result: 大量实验表明，LRPO显著优于基线方法，在盲人脸恢复质量上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LRPO是首个将在线强化学习应用于盲人脸恢复的框架，通过精心设计的奖励机制和正则化策略，有效解决了恢复质量与保真度之间的平衡问题。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: DentVLM是一个多模态视觉语言模型，专门用于口腔疾病诊断，在36个诊断任务中显著优于现有模型，并在临床研究中证明能够提升牙医的诊断效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在口腔医学中主要针对单一任务，无法满足临床实践中复杂的多模态需求，需要开发能够综合处理多种成像模态的先进诊断工具。

Method: 使用包含110,447张图像和246万视觉问答对的大规模双语数据集开发DentVLM，该模型能够解释7种2D口腔成像模态，涵盖36个诊断任务。

Result: DentVLM在口腔疾病诊断准确率上比领先模型高19.6%，在错颌畸形诊断上高27.9%。临床研究中，在36个任务中超过13名初级牙医的21个任务和12名高级牙医的12个任务，协作工作流可将初级牙医提升至高级水平，诊断时间减少15-22%。

Conclusion: DentVLM是一个强大的临床决策支持工具，能够提升初级牙科护理质量，缓解医患不平衡问题，并在牙科领域普及专业医疗知识。

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic-TreeRPO方法，通过树结构搜索和动态噪声强度改进文本到图像生成的强化学习训练，结合LayerTuning-RL范式，在多个基准测试中显著提升生成质量和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习在文本到图像生成中虽然提升了质量，但存在探索效率低和采样策略不高效的问题，特别是在采样组变化较小时。

Method: 采用滑动窗口采样策略构建树结构搜索，在树结构中执行GRPO引导优化和约束SDE采样，通过共享前缀路径分摊计算开销，并设计动态噪声强度增强探索变化。

Result: 在HPS-v2.1、PickScore和ImageReward基准测试中分别超越现有最佳方法4.9%、5.91%和8.66%，同时训练效率提升近50%。

Conclusion: 树结构采样和LayerTuning-RL范式能够动态探索多样化的搜索空间，在语义一致性、视觉保真度和人类偏好对齐方面表现优异，同时显著提高训练效率。

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

*Lin Tian,Xiaoling Hu,Juan Eugenio Iglesias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种测试时不确定性估计框架，无需修改或重新训练预训练配准网络，通过分析空间扰动下网络预测的方差来评估配准可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度配准网络缺乏对其预测可靠性的指示，现有不确定性估计方法需要架构修改或重新训练，限制了在预训练网络中的应用。

Method: 基于配准的变换等变性原理，通过空间扰动输入图像并分析网络预测的方差，将基于扰动的不确定性分解为内在扩散和偏差抖动两个分量。

Result: 在四个解剖结构（脑、心脏、腹部、肺）和多个配准模型上的实验表明，不确定性图与配准误差一致相关，能突出需要谨慎处理的区域。

Conclusion: 该框架可将任何预训练配准网络转化为风险感知工具，使医学图像配准更接近在临床和大规模研究环境中的安全部署。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

TL;DR: GRAPE是一种即插即用的检索增强查询重写方法，通过引入排序信号来解决CLIP模型在分布偏移场景下的性能下降问题，在多种分布偏移场景下平均提升Recall@10达4.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在处理与训练分布不同的查询时性能下降，现有基于LLM的查询重写方法缺乏监督信号，无法生成最优的重写结果。

Method: 提出GRAPE方法，使用GRPO将排序信号融入检索引导的查询重写过程，采用基于语料相对排序的奖励机制来抑制分数膨胀问题。

Result: 在多种分布偏移场景（多语言、长文本、多模态）下，GRAPE显著提升了检索性能，平均Recall@10提升4.9%。

Conclusion: GRAPE通过将排序信号融入查询重写过程，有效解决了CLIP模型在分布偏移下的性能问题，为检索系统提供了实用的增强方案。

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CasPoinTr是一个使用级联网络和知识蒸馏的点云补全框架，通过两阶段协同工作解决点云不完整问题，在ShapeNet-55数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界采集的点云通常不完整，受限于传感器分辨率、单一视角、遮挡和噪声等因素，这使得点云补全对于各种应用至关重要。关键难点是从高度不完整的点云预测整体形状并重建缺失区域。

Method: CasPoinTr将补全任务分解为两个协同阶段：形状重建阶段生成辅助信息，融合补全阶段利用这些信息和知识蒸馏生成最终输出。通过知识蒸馏，在更密集点云上训练的教师模型将不完整-完整关联知识传递给学生模型。

Result: 在ShapeNet-55数据集不同难度设置下的实验表明，CasPoinTr在形状恢复和细节保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 级联结构和蒸馏策略有效增强了模型捕捉全局形状上下文同时细化局部细节的能力，成功弥合了不完整输入与完整目标之间的差距。

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPose是一个统一的跨模态姿态先验传播方法，通过自监督学习将2D人体姿态估计标注迁移到3D领域，无需3D关键点标注，在RGB-D序列上实现弱监督的3D人体姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D人体姿态估计需要大量人工标注3D关键点的问题，通过利用容易获取的RGB-D序列和现有2D姿态标注，避免多视角相机校准和合成到真实数据迁移的问题。

Method: 使用现成的2D姿态估计作为点云网络的弱监督，结合时空约束（身体对称性和关节运动），通过2D到3D反投影损失和跨模态交互增强学习过程，采用锚点到关节预测方法在RGB和深度网络上进行3D提升。

Result: 在CMU Panoptic和ITOP数据集上的实验表明，UniPose达到了与全监督方法相当的性能，结合大规模未标注数据（如NTU RGB+D 60）在挑战性条件下性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: UniPose展示了在无需3D标注的情况下实现高质量3D人体姿态估计的潜力，其提出的3D提升方法达到了最先进的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Motivation: 现有自接触数据集缺乏多样化的自接触姿态和精确的身体形状，限制了自接触姿态与形状之间关系的分析。不同BMI的人在相同姿态下会产生不同的自接触效果。

Result: 实验表明形状条件对于成功建模自接触姿态分布至关重要，能够显著改进单视角姿态估计在自接触场景下的性能。

Conclusion: 身体形状是建模自接触姿态的关键因素，提出的形状条件自接触先验模型有效提升了姿态估计的准确性。

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

Motivation: 现有的驾驶场景生成方法主要关注合成多样化和高保真度的驾驶视频，但缺乏3D一致性和稀疏视角覆盖，难以支持高质量的新视角合成。而3D/4D重建方法虽然改进了新视角合成，但缺乏生成能力。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：(i) 引入4D感知潜在扩散模型，集成多模态信息以前馈方式生成像素对齐的4D高斯；(ii) 使用增强的视频扩散模型对从这些高斯渲染的新视角视频进行细化。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，WorldSplat能够有效生成高保真度、时空一致的多视角驾驶视频。

Conclusion: WorldSplat成功解决了场景生成与重建之间的困境，为自动驾驶系统提供了可扩展和可控的训练数据生成方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis,
traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced
physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by
the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep
learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for
fracture detection, demonstrating significant potential in improving diagnostic
efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes an improved YOLO-based model,
termed Fracture-YOLO, which integrates novel Critical-Region-Selector Attention
(CRSelector) and Scale-Aware (ScA) heads to further enhance detection
performance. Specifically, the CRSelector module utilizes global texture
information to focus on critical features of fracture regions. Meanwhile, the
ScA module dynamically adjusts the weights of features at different scales,
enhancing the model's capacity to identify fracture targets at multiple scales.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline model,
Fracture-YOLO achieves a significant improvement in detection precision, with
mAP50 and mAP50-95 increasing by 4 and 3, surpassing the baseline model and
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Result: 在GRAZPEDWRI-DX数据集上达到40.0% mAP_{50-95}(提升7.5%)、63.9% mAP_{50}(提升4.2%)，骨折检测精度提升2.9%。

Conclusion: FracDetNet通过创新的注意力机制和特征校准策略，显著提升了骨折检测性能，为医学影像诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is
proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture
detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical
practice. Despite recent advancements, existing methods still struggle with
detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging
angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet
integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC).
Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and
comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention
mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to
enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly
available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
FracDetNet achieving a mAP$_{50-95}$ of 40.0\%, reflecting a \textbf{7.5\%}
improvement over the baseline model. Furthermore, the mAP$_{50}$ reaches
63.9\%, representing an increase of \textbf{4.2\%}, with fracture-specific
detection accuracy also enhanced by \textbf{2.9\%}.

*Sahithya Ravi,Aditya Chinchure,Raymond T. Ng,Leonid Sigal,Vered Shwartz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPIKE是一个推理时框架，通过量化贝叶斯惊喜来识别视频中的关键时刻，引导视频-LLM进行惊喜加权的帧采样，在多个下游基准测试中优于均匀采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界视频通常包含常规活动和令人难忘的意外事件，但现有Video-LLM通过均匀采样帧处理视频，很可能错过定义视频叙事的关键时刻。

Method: 引入SPIKE框架量化贝叶斯惊喜（新视觉证据引发的信念更新），识别视觉证据与先验信念冲突的时刻；开发SPIKE-RL使用GRPO优化基于视频字幕奖励信号的信念假设。

Result: SPIKE能有效定位视频中的惊喜时刻，与人类在正面（FunQA）和负面（Oops!）惊喜基准上高度相关；惊喜加权帧采样在五个下游基准测试中持续优于均匀采样。

Conclusion: 通过让Video-LLM跟踪信念并注册惊喜，为构建更鲁棒的模型铺平道路，这些模型能够根据新信息修正理解。

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FM-SIREN和FM-FINER，通过为周期性激活分配神经元特定的频率乘子来解决现有INR网络中的隐藏特征冗余问题，无需超参数调优或增加网络深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于周期性激活的隐式神经表示网络（如SIREN和FINER）存在隐藏特征冗余问题，由于使用固定频率乘子导致层内神经元捕获重叠的频率分量，限制了多层感知器的表达能力。

Method: 受离散正弦变换等经典信号处理方法启发，为周期性激活分配基于奈奎斯特频率的神经元特定频率乘子，引入频率多样性。

Result: 将特征冗余减少近50%，在多种INR任务中（1D音频、2D图像、3D形状拟合和神经辐射场合成）持续改善信号重建效果，优于基准模型同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 这种简单而原则性的修改能有效减少特征冗余，提高隐式神经表示网络的表达能力，在各种任务中均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了FoR-SALE框架，通过引入参考坐标系来改进多模态语言模型的空间理解能力，在文本到图像生成中处理非相机视角的空间描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理非相机视角的空间描述时表现不佳，需要整合参考坐标系这一人类空间推理的基本概念。

Method: 基于SLD框架扩展，通过视觉模块提取图像空间配置，将空间表达式映射到相机视角，检测对齐度后应用潜在空间操作调整图像方向和深度。

Result: 在专门评估空间理解的基准测试中，将最先进T2I模型的性能提升了5.3%，仅需单轮修正。

Conclusion: FoR-SALE框架有效提升了多模态模型的空间理解能力，为整合参考坐标系到文本到图像生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPCNet是一个紧凑的、与估计器无关的模块，可将单目3D姿态估计器产生的相机中心骨架转换为身体中心的规范坐标系，消除视角依赖性，便于运动分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D姿态估计器产生相机中心的骨架，创建视角依赖的运动信号，这在健康和体育科学等应用中的比较分析变得复杂。

Method: 3DPCNet使用混合编码器融合图卷积网络的局部骨骼特征和transformer的全局上下文，通过门控交叉注意力机制预测连续的6D旋转，映射到SO(3)矩阵来对齐姿态。模型在MM-Fi数据集上通过合成旋转姿态进行自监督训练。

Result: 在MM-Fi基准测试中，3DPCNet将平均旋转误差从20°以上降低到3.4°，平均关节位置误差从约64mm降低到47mm。在TotalCapture数据集上的定性评估显示，该方法产生的加速度信号与地面真实IMU传感器数据具有强视觉对应性。

Conclusion: 3DPCNet能够有效消除视角变异性，实现物理上合理的运动分析，为基于视频的运动分析提供了可靠的规范坐标系转换方法。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个细粒度的测试时优化框架，通过将输入提示分解为语义概念并在全局和概念层面评估对齐度，使用细粒度CLIP变体计算概念级对应关系，通过迭代提示优化循环来提升文本到图像生成的组合忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在处理复杂提示时经常遗漏或误表示特定对象和属性，测试时优化方法虽然能解决这一问题，但大多仅依赖全局图像/文本相似度评分，缺乏细粒度的概念级评估。

Method: 将输入提示分解为语义概念，使用细粒度CLIP变体计算概念级对应关系，生成关于缺失或不准确概念的详细反馈，并将反馈输入到迭代提示优化循环中，让大语言模型提出改进的提示。

Result: 在DrawBench和CompBench提示上的实验表明，该方法在概念覆盖率和人类判断的忠实度方面显著优于标准测试时优化方法和基础T2I模型。

Conclusion: 提出的细粒度测试时优化框架通过概念级评估和迭代提示优化，有效提升了文本到图像生成的组合忠实度，解决了现有方法在复杂提示处理中的局限性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

Motivation: 现有预训练多模态人脸反欺诈模型无法检测新目标域的未知攻击，而领域自适应方法在单模态中已有研究，但在多模态中尚未探索

Method: 1) 从其他模态提取互补特征替代缺失模态；2) 利用多模态预测不确定性获取可靠伪标签；3) 设计自适应机制动态调整损失权重防止模型退化

Result: 大量实验证明MFAS-DANet的有效性和最先进性能

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet成功解决了多模态人脸反欺诈在领域自适应中的关键挑战，实现了优越性能

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

TL;DR: RestoRect提出了一种新颖的潜在整流流特征蒸馏方法，通过可学习的潜在空间轨迹让学生网络学习合成教师质量的图像特征，解决了图像恢复中性能与速度的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像恢复方法面临关键权衡：高性能模型太慢不实用，而快速模型效果差。现有静态特征匹配方法无法捕捉现代transformer架构动态生成特征的方式。

Method: 应用整流流将特征蒸馏重新表述为生成过程，结合Retinex理论进行物理分解、可学习各向异性扩散约束和三角色彩空间极化，引入特征层提取损失实现跨架构知识迁移。

Result: 在15个图像恢复数据集、4个任务、8个指标上展示了优越结果，实现了更好的训练稳定性、更快的收敛和推理速度，同时保持恢复质量。

Conclusion: RestoRect通过潜在整流流特征蒸馏有效解决了图像恢复中性能与速度的权衡问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge
transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized
transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.
RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and
inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results
across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于低秩假设，难以建模无约束动态场景中复杂的区域特定变形，需要更有效的动态建模方法。

Method: 首先估计全局方向场作为结构指导，然后提出方向感知超高斯表示，将时间、空间、几何和方向嵌入统一概率状态，通过条件切片推断区域特定变形。

Result: 实验表明OriGS在具有挑战性的真实动态场景中相比主流方法具有更优的重建保真度。

Conclusion: OriGS通过方向锚定的高斯表示有效解决了复杂动态场景的4D重建问题，实现了对多样化局部动态的自适应捕捉。

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

TL;DR: 该研究通过大规模实证分析发现，多模态基准测试中视觉和文本模态的依赖关系存在显著差异，许多旨在减少文本偏见的基准反而放大了图像依赖，且模型越大越倾向于利用单模态依赖而非真正的多模态推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解单模态依赖（单个模态对目标任务的贡献）和跨模态依赖（模态间关系及其与目标任务的关联）对于推进多模态学习至关重要，但现有基准评估中这些依赖关系的性质和相互作用仍缺乏系统表征。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型对23个视觉问答基准进行大规模实证研究，涵盖通用知识推理、专家知识推理、光学字符识别和文档理解等领域，量化视觉、文本及其交互的依赖关系。

Result: 研究发现视觉、问题和它们之间交互的依赖关系在不同基准之间和内部存在显著差异；许多旨在减轻文本偏见的基准无意中放大了图像依赖；这种特征在不同模型规模中持续存在，大模型常利用单模态依赖实现高性能，掩盖了缺乏真正多模态推理的事实。

Conclusion: 研究提供了多模态数据集的量化表征，为多模态基准设计和评估提供了原则性方法，揭示了当前基准评估中存在的依赖关系不平衡问题。

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

Motivation: 息肉分割在结直肠癌检测中至关重要，但由于息肉形状、大小多样且边界对比度低，现有方法面临挑战。需要开发能够准确描绘复杂息肉边界的高效分割方法。

Method: 提出动态核(DK)机制与全局编码器注意力(EA)模块集成框架。DK通过EA模块的全局上下文向量初始化，在解码阶段迭代优化分割预测；EA模块聚合所有编码层的多尺度信息；解码器采用统一通道适配(UCA)标准化特征维度。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps
in action and spatiotemporal understanding.

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking
a significant advancement in the literature.

Result: 在安全中心指标上达到最先进性能：最佳校准（ECE为5.8% vs 低分辨率训练基线的6.2%）、最高AUPR用于困倦检测（0.78 vs 0.74）、手机使用检测的卓越精度召回（0.74 vs 0.71）

Conclusion: 虽然低分辨率训练视频模型作为强大的通用基线，但我们的自适应框架代表了安全关键应用中可靠性至关重要的最先进解决方案

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for
model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best
calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for
drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced
hallucinations. While LR-trained video models serve as strong general-purpose
baselines, our adaptive framework represents the state-of-the-art solution for
safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

*Hongyang Li,Jinyuan Qu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVSeg3R是一个从2D感知模型学习开放词汇3D实例分割的训练方案，通过3D重建技术将2D实例掩码投影到3D空间生成标注，并提出视图实例分区和2D实例边界感知超点算法来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了从成熟的2D感知模型学习开放词汇3D实例分割，避免昂贵的人工标注，同时使输入与现实应用对齐。

Method: 利用3D重建模型提供的2D到3D对应关系，将2D实例掩码预测投影到3D空间；提出视图实例分区算法避免错误监督；引入2D实例边界感知超点算法改进几何聚类。

Result: 在ScanNet200基准测试上整体提升+2.3 mAP，显著缩小尾类和头类之间的性能差距；在标准开放词汇设置下，新类性能比先前方法提升约+7.1 mAP。

Conclusion: OVSeg3R成功将最先进的封闭词汇3D实例分割模型扩展到开放词汇，并显著提升了新类别的分割性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)作为神经辐射场(NeRF)的显式高效替代方案，在SLAM、远程呈现、机器人操作和3D内容生成等领域逐渐取代NeRF方法，平衡了真实感渲染、几何保真度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究3DGS在不同领域被采用的原因，解释其技术优势、适应不同输入模态的能力以及现有局限性，为神经渲染在感知、交互和内容创建中的应用提供路线图。

Method: 通过系统比较领域特定的流水线，围绕统一的研究问题组织综述：技术优势、适应性和局限性。

Result: 3DGS在真实感渲染、几何保真度和计算效率之间实现了良好平衡，正在逐步取代基于NeRF的方法。

Conclusion: 3DGS为神经渲染在图像合成、感知、交互和内容创建方面的应用提供了有前景的路径，连接了真实和虚拟环境。

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual
environments.

TL;DR: 首个用于MRI胰腺头、体、尾分割的联邦学习方法，解决了胰腺疾病区域异质性和数据稀缺问题，通过跨7个医疗机构的协作训练实现了临床可行的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺疾病具有显著的区域异质性（癌症多发生在头部，慢性胰腺炎导致尾部组织损失），准确的胰腺分区分割对于精确诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但MRI中由于形态多变、软组织对比度差和患者间解剖变异，该任务极具挑战性。

Method: 提出隐私保护的联邦学习框架，在7个医疗机构间协作训练而不共享数据，使用711个T1W和726个T2W MRI扫描。评估了三种分割架构（U-Net、Attention U-Net、Swin UNETR）与两种FL算法（FedAvg、FedProx）的组合，并引入基于解剖学知识的损失函数优先考虑MRI中的区域特异性纹理对比度。

Result: 研究发现Attention U-Net与FedAvg组合最适合处理胰腺异质性，该方法在分布式异构数据集上训练仍能达到临床可行的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了首个用于MRI胰腺分区分割的联邦学习方法，解决了数据稀缺和胰腺区域异质性挑战，为胰腺疾病的精确诊断和治疗规划提供了有效工具。

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

TL;DR: 提出NeuroAdapter框架，直接基于大脑表征条件化潜在扩散模型，无需中间特征空间，实现端到端的脑信号到图像解码，并提供更好的生成过程透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过将脑信号映射到中间图像或文本特征空间来指导生成过程，这掩盖了不同大脑区域对最终重建输出的贡献。

Method: 开发NeuroAdapter框架，直接条件化潜在扩散模型于大脑表征，并贡献IBBI双向可解释性框架，通过跨注意力机制分析不同皮层区域对生成轨迹的影响。

Result: 在公共fMRI数据集上展示了与先前工作相当的视觉重建质量，同时提供了对脑信号如何塑造生成过程的更大透明度。

Conclusion: 结果突显了端到端脑到图像解码的潜力，并建立了通过视觉神经科学视角解释扩散模型的路径。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)虽然性能优于U-Net，但计算和内存成本高阻碍了实际部署。激活量化是DiTs极低位量化的主要瓶颈。

Method: 建立了强健的三元权重基线，提出RobustQuantizer进行激活量化，使用Hadamard变换将未知分布转换为正态分布，并提出首个仅激活混合精度网络(AMPN)。

Result: 在无条件/条件图像生成任务中，RobuQ在低于4位量化配置下实现了最先进的DiT量化性能，首次在ImageNet-1K上实现平均2位激活量化的稳定竞争性图像生成。

Conclusion: RobuQ框架成功解决了DiTs的量化挑战，为高效部署扩散变换器提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

Motivation: 解决当前视频人脸增强方法面临的三个挑战：复杂面部纹理建模与时间一致性保持、高质量训练数据缺乏导致的模型泛化限制、推理过程中重复去噪步骤导致的低效率。

Method: 基于预训练的WANX视频生成模型，采用单步流匹配范式；提出联合潜在-像素人脸聚焦训练策略，通过随机切换面部区域优化和全局重建进行两阶段训练；引入MLLM驱动的数据筛选流程自动选择高质量视频人脸数据集。

Result: 在感知质量、身份保持和时间稳定性方面达到最先进水平，同时提供实用的研究资源。

Conclusion: VividFace通过创新的训练策略和高效架构，成功解决了视频人脸增强的关键挑战，实现了高质量、高效的人脸增强效果。

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

Motivation: 传统静态地图构建成本高、难以实时更新且缺乏跨区域泛化能力，限制了自动驾驶系统的可扩展性，因此需要转向动态的传感器驱动感知方法。

Method: 通过四个研究方向实现范式转变：紧凑空间建模（矢量化地图构建）、语义关系推理（拓扑结构建模）、鲁棒领域知识集成（先验知识融合）和多模态场景理解（语言模型感知）。

Result: 这些方法共同推动了更适应性强、可扩展且可解释的自动驾驶系统的发展，实现了从静态地图到动态实时感知的转变。

Conclusion: 拓扑感知感知的研究方向为自动驾驶系统提供了从依赖静态地图到动态实时感知的可行路径，通过融合多种技术方法实现了更智能的环境理解能力。

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 现有基于模拟图像的方法包含大量无关信息（如背景、噪声），影响迁移信息质量，需要探索能迁移更纯净关键目标知识的新模拟数据。

Method: 提出多层次异构知识迁移网络，包括任务关联信息选择器分离非信息知识、目标通用知识迁移模块使用最大判别散度进行分布对齐、类别关系知识迁移模块利用类别关系一致性约束。

Result: 在由FSCM数据和实测SAR图像组成的两个新数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过逐步的知识选择和迁移，确保了迁移的FSCM知识的完整性，有效解决了模拟与实测数据不平衡导致的优化偏差问题。

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

Motivation: 解决在挑战性光照条件下新颖物体的6D姿态估计问题，需要在准确初始姿态估计和高效实时跟踪之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用共享的照明不变颜色对特征表示，该特征既用于初始估计阶段（在实时RGB-D视图和物体3D网格之间进行鲁棒配准），也用于跟踪阶段（验证时间对应关系，使轻量级模型能够可靠地回归物体运动）。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法既有效又鲁棒，在保持高保真跟踪的同时提供有竞争力的姿态估计精度，即使在突然的姿态变化下也能保持性能。

Conclusion: 提出的集成方法通过共享特征表示成功实现了准确初始姿态估计和高效实时跟踪的统一，特别适合在边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and
  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while
effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.
A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high
  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration
tasks demonstrate
  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration
quality and

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

TL;DR: GRS-SLAM3R是一个基于DUSt3R的端到端SLAM框架，支持序列化输入并增量估计全局坐标系下的度量尺度点云，通过空间记忆和子图分割实现全局一致性重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DUSt3R方法仅使用图像对估计点图，忽略了空间记忆和全局一致性，需要改进以支持序列化输入和全局坐标重建。

Method: 使用潜在状态作为空间记忆，设计基于Transformer的门控更新模块来重置和更新空间记忆；将场景分割为子图，在子图内进行局部对齐，并使用相对约束将所有子图注册到共同世界坐标系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该框架实现了优越的重建精度，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: GRS-SLAM3R通过空间记忆和子图策略有效解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了高精度且实时的密集场景重建。

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

*Tangtangfang Fang,Jingxi Hu,Xiangjian He,Jiaqi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MAN模型，一种基于潜在扩散增强的多阶段抗噪声网络，用于高效高质量的低剂量CT图像去噪，在保持高质量的同时大幅提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在低剂量CT去噪中表现出色，但计算成本极高（单次扫描推理时间超过千秒），严重阻碍了临床采用。

Method: 在压缩的潜在空间中操作，使用感知优化的自动编码器，让基于注意力的条件U-Net执行快速、确定性的条件去噪扩散过程，显著减少计算开销。

Result: 在LDCT和Projection数据集上，模型实现优越的感知质量，超越CNN/GAN方法，与计算量大的扩散模型（如DDPM和Dn-Dp）的重建保真度相当，推理速度比像素空间扩散去噪器快60倍以上，PSNR/SSIM分数保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过弥合高保真度和临床可行性之间的差距，为医学成像中先进生成模型的实际应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than
representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on
PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical
viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced
generative models in medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff)框架，通过噪声和潜在层面的融合解决多源图像融合中的共存生成和偏差生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多源图像融合在艺术创作、虚拟现实等领域有广泛应用，但现有方法存在两个关键挑战：共存生成（对象简单并置而非真正融合）和偏差生成（语义不平衡导致一个对象主导输出）。

Method: VMDiff包含：(1) 混合采样过程，结合引导去噪、反转和球面插值实现结构感知融合；(2) 高效自适应调整模块，使用基于相似性的分数自动搜索最优参数。

Result: 在780个概念对的基准测试中，该方法在视觉质量、语义一致性和人类评价的创造力方面优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: VMDiff能够有效解决多源图像融合中的共存和偏差问题，生成更连贯、平衡的融合结果。

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于真实世界交通场景的闭环评估框架，通过基础设施传感器数据在CARLA模拟器中创建数字孪生交叉口，用于更真实地评估端到端自动驾驶模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于CARLA模拟器的闭环基准测试使用手动配置的交通场景，与现实世界条件存在差异，限制了其反映实际驾驶性能的能力。

Method: 从100小时基础设施传感器视频数据中提取800个动态交通场景，为15个真实世界交叉口创建静态数字孪生资产，在CARLA模拟器中实现基础设施协同的闭环评估。

Result: 开发了一个具有挑战性的闭环评估框架，能够更真实地模拟复杂城市交叉口的交通和环境特征，包括多样化的驾驶行为、位置、天气条件和时间。

Conclusion: 该框架为端到端自动驾驶模型提供了更贴近现实世界的评估基准，解决了现有模拟环境与现实条件脱节的问题。

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowLUT是一个端到端的图像增强模型，结合了3D LUT的高效性、多先验知识和流匹配重建的参数无关特性，解决了深度学习方法在计算效率和表示能力之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D LUT虽然能实时处理图像，但缺乏表示灵活性且依赖固定先验。需要一种既能保持高效计算又能提供灵活表示能力的图像增强方法。

Method: 1) 使用可微分3D LUT集合进行色彩空间变换；2) 轻量级内容感知网络预测融合权重，实现场景自适应色彩校正；3) 创新的迭代流匹配方法恢复局部结构细节和消除伪影；4) 在复合损失函数下联合优化整个模型。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FlowLUT成功地将LUT的高效性、多先验知识和流匹配重建相结合，在保持实时处理能力的同时提升了图像增强的质量和灵活性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动仿真器主要依赖监督学习来对齐模拟分布与真实驾驶场景，但存在训练与测试之间的分布偏移问题，影响了模型在未知环境中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用R1风格的强化微调范式，包含度量导向的策略优化算法和迭代的"SFT-RFT-SFT"训练策略，交替进行监督微调和强化微调以最大化性能增益。

Result: 在Waymo Open Motion Dataset上的广泛实验验证了该框架的有效性，在Waymo Open Sim Agents Challenge中实现了0.7858的总体真实感元分数，在提交时排名第一。

Conclusion: SMART-R1是一个简单而强大的R1风格训练框架，能够有效增强基础模型在多智能体交通仿真中的性能，实现了最先进的结果。

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training
framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim
Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the
leaderboard at the time of submission.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人-场景交互数据集存在交互类别不足、主要关注静态物体交互的问题，而收集包含可移动物体的数据集既困难又昂贵。

Method: 首先使用3D视觉定位模型识别交互对象，然后通过手-物联合可供性学习预测不同手关节和物体部件的接触区域，最后通过局部场景建模和碰撞避免约束优化交互。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法在生成物理合理、符合文本描述的交互方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的任务和解决方案能够有效处理3D场景中可移动物体的人-物交互生成，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

Conclusion: 当前视线估计方法在HRI系统中存在实际局限性，需要讨论如何更好地将视线估计整合为HRI系统的模态。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the current gaze estimation methods within an HRI
context of a shared workspace scenario. We introduce a new, annotated dataset
collected with the NICO robotic platform. We evaluate four state-of-the-art
gaze estimation models. The evaluation shows that the angular errors are close
to those reported on general-purpose benchmarks. However, when expressed in
terms of distance in the shared workspace the best median error is 16.48 cm
quantifying the practical limitations of current methods. We conclude by
discussing these limitations and offering recommendations on how to best
integrate gaze estimation as a modality in HRI systems.

Motivation: 当前视网膜血管分割方法主要依赖监督学习和大量人工标注，这在OCTA图像中成本高、易出错且难以获取。需要开发无需标注数据的血管分割方法。

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a
label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution
for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring,
blood flow modeling, and progression prediction. Code and dataset are

Conclusion: DiffInk是首个用于全行手写生成的潜在扩散Transformer框架，能够有效解耦字符内容和书写风格，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的掩码扩散视觉语言模型缺乏自校正能力，无法纠正生成token中的错误，包括语法、拼写和逻辑错误。

Method: 1. 自省训练：引入自省模型识别生成序列中的错误；2. 递归推理：通过交替执行解掩码→自省→重新掩码的循环过程，直到获得可靠结果。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RIV模型实现了最先进的性能，超越了大多数现有的MDVLM模型。

Conclusion: RIV模型成功为掩码扩散视觉语言模型赋予了自校正能力，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Result: 在真实机器人操作数据集上的实验表明，这些技术显著提高了不同机器人环境中的动作连贯性和视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过主动利用动作参数来引导扩散过程，可以有效提升机器人视频生成的动作控制能力和视觉质量。

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a
single, efficient student network. Extensive experiments show that FAMDA
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard synthetic-to-real UDA
multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks and a challenging new day-to-night
adaptation task. Our framework enables the training of highly efficient models;
a lightweight variant achieves SOTA accuracy while being more than 10$\times$
smaller than foundation models, highlighting FAMDA's suitability for creating
domain-adaptive and efficient models for resource-constrained robotics
applications.

Result: 消融研究验证了各组件有效性，广泛实验表明在多种运动相关任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: MotionVerse提供了一个高效统一的运动理解和生成框架，在单人和多人场景下均展现出卓越性能。

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放环境中，机器人会遇到未知物体，需要语义理解能力来泛化到已知类别及以外的物体，解决类别级物体姿态估计的挑战。

Method: 结合DINOv2特征作为连续语义先验，使用光真实感训练数据和点法线噪声模型，通过交叉注意力注入语义先验，学习跨物体实例的规范化坐标系系统。

Result: 在合成训练的类别级物体姿态估计中，SCOPE在5°5cm指标上相对当前最优方法提升了31.9%，在两个实例级数据集上展示了对未知类别物体的泛化能力，抓取成功率高达100%。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过连续语义先验有效缩小了Sim2Real差距，在类别级物体姿态估计中实现了最先进的性能，并能泛化到未知类别物体。

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

*Boyu Han,Qianqian Xu,Shilong Bao,Zhiyong Yang,Kangli Zi,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightFair是一种轻量级方法，通过微调文本嵌入来解决文本到图像扩散模型的偏见问题，采用协作距离约束去偏策略和两阶段文本引导采样策略，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低训练负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么需要全参数训练，要么依赖辅助网络进行校正，导致训练或采样负担重且性能不佳。文本编码器作为最可微调的前端模块，其输出在CLIP空间中存在显著偏斜，且噪声预测网络会进一步放大这种不平衡。

Method: 提出协作距离约束去偏策略来平衡嵌入距离，无需辅助参考；引入两阶段文本引导采样策略，限制去偏文本编码器的干预时机以保持原始生成质量。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion v1.5上，该方法仅需1/4的训练负担就实现了SOTA去偏效果，采样负担几乎没有增加。

Conclusion: LightFair是一种有效且高效的公平文本到图像扩散模型方法，通过聚焦文本编码器微调实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

TL;DR: 提出了EfficientMIL，一种线性复杂度的多实例学习方法，用于全切片图像分类，通过自适应补丁选择器和高效序列模型取代了Transformer中的二次复杂度自注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的多实例学习方法依赖注意力机制，虽然性能良好但计算资源需求大，存在二次复杂度问题，特别是在处理数十万个补丁时。

Method: 设计了自适应补丁选择器（APS），用基于RNN的GRU、LSTM和状态空间模型Mamba等高效序列模型替代Transformer中的自注意力机制，实现线性复杂度。

Result: 在TCGA-Lung数据集上，EfficientMIL-Mamba达到AUC 0.976和准确率0.933；在CAMELYON16数据集上，EfficientMIL-GRU达到AUC 0.990和准确率0.975，超越了先前的最优方法。

Conclusion: EfficientMIL在显著提升计算效率的同时，在多个组织病理学数据集上优于其他多实例学习方法，且APS在补丁选择方面比传统策略更有效。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

Motivation: 水面漂浮碎片的准确分割常受到表面眩光和室外光照变化的影响，偏振成像提供了一种单传感器方法来缓解这些问题。

Method: 在PoTATO数据集上对最先进的融合网络进行基准测试，并与使用传统模型的单图像基线进行比较。

Result: 偏振线索有助于恢复低对比度物体并抑制反射引起的误报，提高了平均IoU并降低了轮廓误差，但增加了计算负载和新的误报风险。

Conclusion: 通过提供可复现的诊断基准和公开代码，帮助研究人员判断偏振相机是否适合其应用，并加速相关研究。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

*Jiuhong Xiao,Roshan Nayak,Ning Zhang,Daniel Tortei,Giuseppe Loianno*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ThermalGen是一个基于自适应流的RGB到热成像图像转换模型，通过RGB图像条件架构和风格解耦机制，能够合成反映不同视角、传感器特性和环境条件变化的热成像图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于同步校准的RGB-热成像图像对稀缺，阻碍了视觉-热成像传感器融合和跨模态任务的进展，因此需要开发RGB到热成像图像转换方法来从丰富的RGB数据集中合成热成像图像用于训练。

Method: 提出ThermalGen自适应流生成模型，包含RGB图像条件架构和风格解耦机制。收集了8个公开的卫星-航空、航空和地面RGB-T配对数据集，并引入了3个新的大规模卫星-航空RGB-T数据集。

Result: 在多个RGB-T基准测试上的广泛评估表明，ThermalGen相比现有的基于GAN和扩散的方法，实现了相当或更优的转换性能。

Conclusion: ThermalGen是第一个能够合成反映显著视角、传感器特性和环境条件变化的热成像图像的RGB-T图像转换模型。

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的多图像布局控制方法，通过图像而非文本指定内容，并提供精确的位置控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型虽然能生成逼真图像，但文本控制存在局限性，需要更精确的内容和位置指导

Method: 训练无关的方法，每个参考仅需单张图像，提供对象和部件级别的显式简单控制

Result: 在各种图像合成任务中展示了有效性

Conclusion: 该方法实现了对多图像布局的精确控制，为图像合成提供了更细粒度的控制能力

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse-Up是一个内存高效的高保真纹理建模框架，通过稀疏体素引导纹理重建，使用表面锚定和视域分区来突破分辨率限制，有效保留高频细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D资产创建方法存在高频细节丢失问题，要么牺牲跨视图一致性导致纹理撕裂，要么受限于显式体素的分辨率上限而丢失精细纹理细节。

Method: 使用稀疏体素指导纹理重建确保多视图一致性；表面锚定采用可学习上采样策略将体素约束在网格表面，减少70%冗余体素；视域分区引入图像块引导的体素分区方案，仅在可见局部块上进行梯度监督和反向传播。

Result: 显著减少高分辨率体素训练时的内存消耗，同时不牺牲几何一致性，能够有效保留纹理中的高频细节。

Conclusion: Sparse-Up框架通过创新的稀疏体素和分区策略，成功解决了3D纹理建模中的高频细节保留和内存效率问题。

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

Result: 在HD分辨率下达到120Hz，VGA分辨率下达到440Hz的处理速度；在光流估计、语义分割和单目度量深度估计等任务上获得最先进性能；在三个机器人平台、不同光照条件和环境下验证了有效性。

Conclusion: F³方法能够高效处理事件相机数据，在各种下游任务中表现优异，适用于不同分辨率和事件率的动态视觉传感器。

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏具有挑战性的多跳问题和高质量的视频推理链数据，限制了RLVR在复杂视频推理中的应用。

Method: 提出多阶段合成流程构建ReWatch数据集，包括多智能体ReAct框架生成推理链，并使用RLVR框架结合O&R奖励机制训练ReWatch-R1模型。

Result: ReWatch-R1在五个挑战性视频推理基准上实现了最先进的平均性能。

Conclusion: ReWatch数据集和RLVR框架有效解决了视频推理中的数据瓶颈问题，显著提升了LVLM在复杂视频推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: HIVTP是一种无需训练的分层视觉令牌剪枝方法，通过中间层注意力图评估令牌重要性，显著提升视觉语言模型的推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉编码器输出的视觉令牌数量庞大严重影响推理效率，许多令牌并不重要可以被安全剪枝。

Method: 使用视觉编码器中间层注意力图评估令牌重要性，采用分层剪枝策略：全局保留阶段按区域保留重要令牌，局部保留阶段在窗口内保留最重要令牌。

Result: 将LLaVA-v1.5-7B和LLaVA-Next-7B的首次令牌生成时间分别降低50.0%和55.1%，令牌生成吞吐量提升60.9%和47.3%，且不损失准确性。

Conclusion: HIVTP在保持更好准确性的同时提供更高的推理效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉Transformer模型在手术视频理解中计算成本过高，现有令牌合并方法未能充分考虑视频数据的时空结构和信息分布异质性。

Method: 采用时空分离策略：时间维度通过显著性权重合并连续帧的空间对应令牌；空间维度通过时间稳定性分析优先合并静态令牌，保护动态区域。

Result: 在保持竞争力的准确率下，实现超过65%的GFLOPs减少，支持长序列手术视频的高效训练。

Conclusion: STIM-TM是首个专门针对手术视频理解的令牌合并方法，有效解决了计算瓶颈问题，无需训练即可实现显著效率提升。

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大型语言模型在视觉语言基准测试中取得了显著成果，但尚不清楚这些基准测试是否真正评估了全局推理能力，还是仅通过局部视觉线索就能成功。现有评估方法无法明确区分这一点，阻碍了有效数据集构建和面向实际应用的模型开发。

Method: 引入区域理解指数(RCI)，通过系统比较参考模型在图像块与完整图像上的性能表现，揭示任务是否需要整体图像理解，还是可以通过部分或局部视觉线索解决。

Result: 将RCI应用于13个广泛使用的多模态基准测试时，发现大多数基准测试偏向局部推理并表现出显著的空间偏差，这表明在实际应用中存在潜在风险。

Conclusion: RCI为研究人员和从业者提供了一个可操作的工具，用于诊断和减轻这些偏差，从而能够构建促进稳健、企业级多模态系统发展的数据集和基准测试。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

Motivation: 现有CNN-Transformer混合模型依赖高复杂度的全局注意力机制来捕获长距离依赖，导致非线性计算复杂度和显著资源消耗。知识蒸馏和稀疏注意力机制虽然能提高效率，但在复杂任务中往往无法达到所需的高分割精度。

Method: 提出MSD-KMamba框架，包含双向空间感知分支和多尺度自蒸馏融合策略。双向空间感知分支捕获脑区域间的长距离空间上下文依赖，并集成强大的非线性特征提取机制。多尺度自蒸馏融合策略增强分层特征表示，改善不同分辨率级别的语义信息传递。

Result: 在多个标准基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MSD-KMamba在分割精度、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面持续优于最先进方法，同时保持高计算效率和良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效缓解了体积分割中二次计算复杂度的瓶颈，同时解决了全局感知不足的限制，为3D多模态图像分割提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly
available at https://github.com/daimao-zhang/MSD-KMamba.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QuantSparse是一个统一框架，将模型量化与注意力稀疏化相结合，通过多尺度显著注意力蒸馏和二阶稀疏注意力重参数化技术，在保持视频生成质量的同时显著降低计算和存储成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在视频生成方面表现出色，但计算和内存成本过高阻碍实际部署。单独使用模型量化或注意力稀疏化在激进压缩下会导致严重性能下降，需要一种统一方法来同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 提出QuantSparse框架：1）多尺度显著注意力蒸馏，利用全局结构指导和局部显著监督缓解量化偏差；2）二阶稀疏注意力重参数化，利用二阶残差的时间稳定性高效恢复稀疏化丢失的信息。

Result: 在HunyuanVideo-13B上的实验表明，QuantSparse达到20.88 PSNR，显著优于最先进的量化基线Q-VDiT（16.85 PSNR），同时实现3.68倍的存储减少和1.88倍的端到端推理加速。

Conclusion: QuantSparse成功地将模型量化与注意力稀疏化相结合，在保持高质量视频生成的同时大幅提升了效率，为扩散变换器的实际部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}
reduction in storage and \textbf{1.88$\times$} acceleration in end-to-end
inference. Our code will be released in
https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantSparse.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HomeSafeBench基准测试，包含12,900个数据点，涵盖五种常见家庭安全隐患，通过动态第一人称视角图像评估视觉语言模型在家庭安全检查中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在两个关键局限：使用文本描述而非视觉信息，以及使用单一静态视角，这限制了具身代理的自由探索并可能导致遗漏安全隐患。

Method: 构建包含12,900个数据点的基准测试，提供模拟家庭环境中的动态第一人称视角图像，允许具身代理自由探索房间以获得多个动态视角。

Result: 对主流视觉语言模型的综合评估显示，即使表现最佳的模型F1分数也仅为10.23%，表明当前模型在识别安全隐患和选择有效探索策略方面存在显著局限。

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench将为未来家庭安全检查相关研究提供有价值的参考和支持，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.
Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.

TL;DR: 通过集成多种骨干网络的SSD模型，使用加权框融合方法提升武器检测的鲁棒性，在遮挡、光照变化等挑战性条件下实现更好的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共空间安全监控需要可靠的武器检测系统，但现有单模型检测器在部分遮挡、光照变化和复杂背景等挑战性条件下缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 集成多个使用不同骨干网络（VGG16、ResNet50、EfficientNet、MobileNetV3）的SSD模型，采用加权框融合方法结合各模型的预测结果。

Result: 使用'max'置信度评分策略的WBF方法实现了0.838的mAP，比最佳单模型相对提升2.948%，且优于其他融合启发式方法。

Conclusion: 置信度感知融合是提升集成模型准确性的关键机制，为监控应用中的实时武器检测提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

TL;DR: INSTINCT是一个基于实例级交互的协作感知框架，通过质量感知过滤、双分支检测路由和跨智能体局部实例融合，在降低通信带宽的同时提升检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作感知系统中频繁交互和实时需求带来的带宽限制问题，同时提升LiDAR协作感知的性能，弥补现有方法与最先进方法的差距。

Method: 提出三个核心组件：1) 质量感知过滤机制选择高质量实例特征；2) 双分支检测路由方案解耦协作相关和不相关实例；3) 跨智能体局部实例融合模块聚合局部混合实例特征。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和V2V4Real数据集上，精度分别提升13.23%和33.08%，通信带宽降低至最先进方法的1/281和1/264。

Conclusion: INSTINCT框架在显著降低通信带宽的同时实现了性能提升，为协作感知系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrimEdit是一个统一的扩散模型，通过联合训练移除和插入任务嵌入，利用无分类器引导技术同时处理物体及其效果（阴影、反射）的移除，并在插入时可控合成物体效果，还能在单步去噪中实现物体重定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用在反事实数据集上训练的扩散模型处理物体效果，但无分类器引导在统一模型中处理物体效果对移除和插入任务性能的影响尚未充分探索。为提高复合编辑效率，需要开发能同时处理移除和插入的统一方法。

Method: 提出CrimEdit，在单个模型中联合训练移除和插入的任务嵌入，并在无分类器引导方案中利用这些嵌入——增强物体及其效果的移除，并在插入时实现物体效果的可控合成。还将这两个任务提示扩展到空间不同区域，实现单步去噪中的物体重定位。

Result: 大量实验表明，CrimEdit通过两种引导技术，实现了优越的物体移除、可控效果插入和高效的物体移动，无需额外训练或单独的移除和插入阶段。

Conclusion: CrimEdit通过统一模型和任务嵌入的联合训练，结合无分类器引导，有效解决了物体编辑中的移除、插入和重定位问题，显著提升了复合编辑的效率和效果。

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

Motivation: 帕金森病诊断流程复杂且依赖神经科医生经验，导致早期检测延迟和及时干预机会错失。需要自动化诊断方法来提高诊断效率和准确性。

Method: 开发PD-Diag-Net框架，包含MRI预处理模块减少扫描差异，整合脑区相关先验和脑区老化先验知识，设计相关先验引导的特征聚合模块和年龄先验引导的诊断模块。

Result: 在外部测试数据上达到86%准确率，早期诊断准确率超过96%，比现有先进方法提升超过20%。

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net通过整合临床先验知识，实现了高效准确的帕金森病自动化诊断，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在扩散模型在低层视觉任务中表现出色，但由于点云的无结构和不规则特性，其在点云补全中的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 1) 将部分点云投影为结构化深度图像，作为DepthLDM的条件生成完整多视角深度图像；2) 设计点去噪网络去除粗点云中的异常值；3) 开发关联感知点上采样器，利用输入点云与粗点之间的局部关联特征进行上采样。

Result: 实验结果表明DiffPCN在几何精度和形状完整性方面达到最先进水平，显著提高了点云补全的鲁棒性和一致性。

Conclusion: DiffPCN成功将扩散模型应用于点云补全任务，通过深度图像条件和两阶段优化策略，实现了高质量的点云生成和补全效果。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

Motivation: 当前3D室内布局生成模型受限于现有数据集的规模小、多样性不足和标注质量差的问题，需要更丰富的数据资源来提升学习能力。

Method: 构建M3DLayout数据集，整合三个来源的数据：真实世界扫描、专业CAD设计和程序生成场景，每个布局都配有描述全局场景、大件家具关系布局和小物件精细安排的详细结构化文本。

Conclusion: M3DLayout可以作为推进文本驱动3D场景合成研究的宝贵资源，其多样性和丰富标注有助于模型学习复杂的空间和语义模式。

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了LUQ（Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization）方法，针对多模态大语言模型进行超低比特量化，通过选择性对更耐受的层应用超低比特量化，在保持性能的同时显著减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型部署需要巨大内存和计算资源，虽然后训练量化已成功压缩纯语言模型至1比特，但其在多模态模型中的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出层间超低比特量化策略，选择性对更耐受的层应用超低比特量化，并使用混合多模态令牌进行后训练量化以提升VQA性能。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5和Qwen-2.5-VL上评估，LUQ模型比4比特模型分别减少40%和31%内存使用，在MME基准上性能下降小于10%。

Conclusion: LUQ方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型的超低比特量化挑战，在显著减少内存占用的同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统单尺度表示建模的固有局限性，实现从低分辨率全局语义特征到高分辨率结构细节的信息渐进流动。

Method: 采用多尺度下采样生成多尺度token序列，结合尺度因果注意力机制，确保信息从粗到细的渐进传递。

Result: 相比单尺度方法，rFID提升27.2%(1.47→1.07)，下游生成任务收敛速度加快1.38倍，gFID提升18.9%(16.4→13.3)，在ViT分词器中达到sota的rFID 0.45和gFID 1.82。

Conclusion: HieraTok是首个在图像重建和生成中引入多尺度ViT分词器的方法，其更平滑均匀的潜在空间分布推动了ViT分词器在视觉生成任务中的发展。

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单类和多类异常检测方法在新类别上表现不佳，主要原因是特征表示学习仍然与类别相关（特征相关性）。需要开发能够泛化到不同领域新类别的类无关异常检测方法。

Method: 1. 学习残差特征分布而非初始特征分布，通过匹配并减去正常参考特征实现特征去相关；2. 提出特征超球约束方法，将初始正常残差特征约束到空间超球中，使不同类别的特征尺度尽可能一致；3. 使用对数障碍双向收缩OCC损失和基于向量量化的特征分布匹配模块增强模型。

Result: 在8个真实世界异常检测数据集上的综合实验表明，ResAD++在新类别上直接使用时能取得显著的异常检测结果，优于最先进的竞争方法，也超越了基础版ResAD。

Conclusion: ResAD++通过残差特征学习和特征尺度一致性约束，有效解决了类无关异常检测中的特征相关性问题，实现了对新类别的良好泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

*Wenjie Yang,Zengfeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Poivre方法，通过自优化过程（先标记、再可视化、最后优化）来提升视觉语言模型在视觉指向任务中的性能，使用强化学习训练，在Point-Bench上达到新SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在视觉指向任务中表现远低于人类水平，主要限制是模型需要单步完成指向任务，这类似于要求人类不看手指直接指向物体。

Method: 提出Poivre自优化流程：先标记估计点，然后迭代优化坐标。使用强化学习训练这种自优化能力，设计了基于经验有效性的过程奖励机制。

Result: 训练的Poivre-7B模型在Point-Bench上创下新记录，超越Gemini-2.5-Pro和Molmo-72B等专有和开源模型超过3%。

Conclusion: Poivre方法通过自优化流程显著提升了视觉语言模型在视觉指向任务中的性能，为未来研究提供了训练代码、数据集和模型检查点。

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's
capability for real-time, accurate performance within familiar distributions.

Result: 在多个任务和基准测试中的广泛实验表明，UniAlignment优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在统一多模态生成方面具有显著潜力，UniAlignment为多模态任务提供了高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GenView++ 是一个统一的对比学习框架，通过多源自适应视图生成和质量驱动的对比学习机制，解决了正样本对构建质量差和缺乏质量评估的问题，在视觉和视觉语言任务上取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比学习方法在正样本对构建方面存在多样性不足和语义损坏风险，在学习方面缺乏质量评估机制导致所有样本对被平等对待，造成次优监督。

Method: 1. 多源自适应视图生成：通过动态调节图像条件、文本条件和图像-文本条件策略的生成参数，合成多样且语义一致的视图；2. 质量驱动的对比学习：评估每对样本的语义对齐和多样性，动态重新加权其训练贡献，优先处理高质量样本对。

Result: 在视觉表示学习中，将MoCov2在ImageNet线性分类上的性能提升+2.5%；在视觉语言学习中，在10个数据集上的平均零样本分类准确率比CLIP提高+12.31%，比SLIP提高+5.31%，Flickr30k文本检索R@5提升+3.2%。

Conclusion: GenView++通过改进正样本对构建质量和引入质量评估机制，显著提升了对比学习在视觉和视觉语言任务上的性能，证明了其在解决当前对比学习局限性方面的有效性。

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MTGRR是一个针对多模态城市数据的图建模框架，通过模态定制化图神经网络和空间感知融合机制，解决了现有方法在模态特定结构捕获和空间异质性处理方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图模型在处理多模态城市数据时存在两个主要问题：使用相同的图神经网络架构无法捕捉模态特定特征；在融合阶段忽略空间异质性，假设所有区域的模态聚合权重相同，导致次优表示。

Method: 1) 将模态分为聚合级和点级两类，分别使用专家混合图架构和双级GNN处理；2) 设计空间感知多模态融合机制动态推断区域特定融合权重；3) 采用联合对比学习策略优化区域表示。

Conclusion: MTGRR通过模态定制化图建模和空间感知融合，有效提升了城市区域表示的质量，在多模态城市数据分析中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling
multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various
downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1)
They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出纹理向量量化和重建感知预测策略，解决VQ方法在视觉先验建模中的量化误差和次优预测问题，实现高质量超分辨率重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQ方法在视觉特征编码时产生较大量化误差，且基于代码级监督训练的预测器无法考虑最终重建误差，导致先验建模精度不足。

Method: 1. 纹理向量量化：仅对缺失纹理引入码本建模先验；2. 重建感知预测：使用直通估计器直接基于图像级监督训练索引预测器。

Result: 提出的TVQ&RAP生成式SR模型能以较小计算成本实现照片级真实感的超分辨率结果。

Conclusion: 通过纹理向量量化和重建感知预测策略，有效解决了VQ方法在视觉先验建模中的核心问题，显著提升了超分辨率性能。

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型参数高效微调方法容易受到微调数据中子群不平衡导致的虚假相关性的影响，这会影响模型的群体鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp)方法，使用组特定文本提示作为组代表，为每个目标类别构建多个分类器。利用VLM文本编码器的丰富语义知识，即使对于训练样本较少的组也能发现有效的组提示。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五种CLIP架构上取得了最佳结果，有时甚至优于微调整个网络的先前方法，而仅训练了网络参数的0.016%。

Conclusion: GroupCoOp是一种简单有效的去偏微调算法，能够显著提升微调视觉语言模型的群体鲁棒性，同时保持参数高效性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of
diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content
creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural

for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry

weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D
layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to
facilitate further research in this domain.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

TL;DR: Uni4D-LLM是首个统一4D场景理解和生成的视觉语言模型框架，通过共享表示和架构实现时空感知的4D任务统一处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D和4D方法通常将场景几何嵌入自回归模型进行语义理解，嵌入扩散模型进行内容生成，这种范式差距阻碍了单一模型同时处理理解和生成任务，特别是在需要时空建模的动态4D场景中。

Method: 1) 共享表示：提取语义特征用于理解，注入噪声的外观特征用于生成，结合4D几何线索，通过自适应交叉注意力融合成时空感知的视觉表示。2) 共享架构：将自回归和扩散都构建在Transformer骨干上，集成到单一LLM中，配备任务特定头部。通过指令微调提高跨任务泛化能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，Uni4D-LLM相比最先进模型取得了竞争性或更优的结果，并首次实现了4D场景理解和生成的真正统一。

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM通过共享表示和架构的设计，成功实现了4D场景理解和生成的统一，为物理世界的视觉语言建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Result: 在MOSEv2测试集上零样本性能达到39.7 JFn，在Complex VOS挑战赛中排名第二

Conclusion: SeC框架通过语义理解显著提升了视频目标分割在复杂场景下的鲁棒性，零样本性能表现优异

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

### [170] [Towards Fine-Grained Text-to-3D Quality Assessment: A Benchmark and A Two-Stage Rank-Learning Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23841)
*Bingyang Cui,Yujie Zhang,Qi Yang,Zhu Li,Yiling Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了T23D-CompBench基准和Rank2Score评估器，用于解决文本到3D生成质量评估的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到3D质量评估存在基准过时、分散、粗粒度，以及客观指标设计限制导致特征提取不具代表性和鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: 构建包含5个组件12个子组件的组合提示基准，生成3600个纹理网格；提出Rank2Score两阶段训练评估器，第一阶段通过监督对比回归和课程学习增强成对训练，第二阶段使用平均意见分数优化预测。

Result: 收集了129,600个可靠的人类评分，实验表明Rank2Score在多个维度上持续优于现有指标，并能作为奖励函数优化生成模型。

Conclusion: T23D-CompBench和Rank2Score为文本到3D质量评估提供了全面基准和有效评估器，显著提升了与人类判断的一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at
https://cbysjtu.github.io/Rank2Score/.

*Michihiro Kuroki,Toshihiko Yamasaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于概念的解释方法CE-FAM，通过融合激活映射来同时揭示图像分类器学习的概念、相关区域及其对预测的贡献，无需标注数据即可处理任意概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著性映射只能突出重要区域但需要用户解释其含义，而基于概念的解释虽然能分解预测但很少有方法能同时揭示学习的概念、相关区域及其贡献。

Method: 使用分支网络共享图像分类器的激活映射，学习模仿视觉语言模型的嵌入，通过概念预测分数的梯度加权激活映射来表示概念区域，并基于对分类分数的影响量化其贡献。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明该方法优于现有方法，在未见概念的零样本推理方面表现出色，并引入了新的概念区域准确性评估指标。

Conclusion: CE-FAM提供了一个通用框架，能够识别概念区域及其贡献，同时利用VLM知识处理任意概念而无需标注数据集。

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

### [172] [FairViT-GAN: A Hybrid Vision Transformer with Adversarial Debiasing for Fair and Explainable Facial Beauty Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23859)
*Djamel Eddine Boukhari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairViT-GAN是一个新颖的混合框架，结合CNN和ViT架构，通过对抗性去偏机制解决面部美预测中的公平性问题，在准确性和公平性方面都达到了最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的面部美预测模型存在架构限制、人口统计偏见和缺乏透明度等问题。CNN擅长捕捉局部纹理但难以处理全局面部和谐，ViT能有效建模长距离依赖但可能忽略细粒度细节，且模型容易学习并延续社会偏见。

Method: 提出FairViT-GAN混合框架，集成CNN分支用于局部特征提取和ViT分支用于全局上下文建模。引入对抗性去偏机制，明确训练特征提取器产生对受保护属性不变的表示，从而主动减轻算法偏见。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准测试中，FairViT-GAN在预测准确性方面达到Pearson相关系数0.9230，RMSE降至0.2650，创下新纪录。在公平性方面，种族亚组之间的性能差距减少了82.9%，对抗者分类准确率降至接近随机水平（52.1%）。

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN为开发负责任的主观视觉评估AI系统提供了一个强大、透明且显著更公平的蓝图。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

*Jiajin Tang,Zhengxuan Wei,Yuchen Zhu,Cheng Shi,Guanbin Li,Liang Lin,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sim-DETR通过约束查询间的自注意力机制和添加查询-帧对齐，解决了DETR在时序语句定位中的异常表现，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现典型的DETR增强策略在时序语句定位任务中不仅没有提升反而可能降低性能，需要分析根本原因并提出解决方案。

Method: 在DETR解码器层中引入两个小修改：1）基于语义和位置重叠约束查询间的自注意力；2）添加查询-帧对齐来桥接全局和局部上下文。

Result: 实验证明Sim-DETR能够充分发挥DETR在时序语句定位任务中的潜力，为未来研究提供了强大的基线。

Conclusion: 通过分析DETR在时序语句定位中的异常行为并针对性改进，提出的Sim-DETR方法有效解决了查询冲突问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了信息锚定引导(IGG)机制，通过注意力机制将引导信号锚定到语义重要区域，解决自回归模型在渐进分辨率缩放中产生的信息不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中面临关键弱点：渐进分辨率缩放引入的跨时间步patch间信息不一致，导致引导信号偏离条件信息，产生模糊不忠实的特征。

Method: 开发了信息锚定引导(IGG)机制，通过注意力自适应地增强采样过程中的信息丰富patch，确保引导与内容保持紧密对齐。

Result: 在类别条件和文本到图像生成任务中，IGG能够生成更清晰、更连贯且语义更准确锚定的图像，为基于AR的方法设定了新基准。

Conclusion: IGG机制有效解决了自回归模型中的信息不一致问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量和语义保真度。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PCRI指标，首次系统量化MLLM对视觉上下文变化的鲁棒性，发现大多数领先模型对背景噪声敏感，只有少数模型表现出跨任务的一致性鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标未能捕捉MLLM在真实场景中对无关或分散视觉上下文的敏感性，这影响了模型的可靠性。

Method: 引入PCRI指标，通过比较局部图像块和完整图像输入的性能变化来系统量化MLLM对视觉上下文粒度变化的鲁棒性。

Result: 在19个最先进MLLM和15个视觉语言基准测试中，发现大多数模型对背景噪声脆弱，只有InternVL2-26B和Qwen2VL-72B等少数模型表现出跨任务一致性鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PCRI支持上下文鲁棒性的严格比较，为研究人员和从业者提供可操作的诊断见解，指导未来架构和训练策略的开发以实现稳健的实际部署。

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

*Taehun Kong,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的半监督3D目标检测框架，通过可学习的伪标签模块自动选择高质量伪标签，解决了传统方法依赖手动阈值的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督3D目标检测方法在伪标签选择上存在不足，要么依赖手动设置阈值，要么忽略了上下文信息（如物体距离、类别和学习状态），无法充分利用网络可用信息来评估伪标签质量。

Method: 在教师网络输出层引入两个网络，通过分数融合可靠评估伪标签质量并确定上下文自适应阈值，同时采用软监督策略在伪标签噪声下进行鲁棒学习。

Result: 在KITTI和Waymo数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法能够选择高精度伪标签，同时保持更广泛的上下文覆盖和更高的召回率。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著改进了相关半监督3D目标检测方法，实现了自动化和自适应的伪标签选择。

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖配对数据且泛化性差，扩散模型需要学习干净数据分布，自监督方法在不同剂量间泛化性能下降严重

Method: 设计上下文子数据相似性自适应感知策略，结合知识蒸馏与潜在扩散模型优化图像细节，使用像素级自校正融合技术增强图像保真度

Result: 在数据集和真实数据上的定性和定量评估显示，SuperDiff在重建和泛化性能上持续优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: SuperDiff通过双域策略级联实现自监督低剂量CT去噪，仅需低剂量CT投影域数据，在重建质量和泛化能力方面表现优异

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AssemblyHands-X，首个用于双手活动的无标记3D手-身体基准数据集，通过联合建模手部和身体线索来改善动作识别，强调了建模手-身体相互依赖动态对理解双手活动的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双手人类活动涉及手部和身体的协调运动，但缺乏合适的数据集来系统评估这种协调性对活动理解的影响。现有3D活动数据集通常只标注手部或身体姿态，而基于标记的运动捕捉会引入视觉伪影。

Method: 构建了从同步多视角视频进行3D姿态标注的流程，结合多视角三角测量和SMPL-X网格拟合，实现手部和上半身的可靠3D配准。验证了不同输入表示（视频、手部姿态、身体姿态或手-身体姿态）在基于图卷积或时空注意力的动作识别模型中的表现。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，基于姿态的动作推断比视频基线更高效和准确。此外，联合建模手部和身体线索比单独使用手部或上半身能改善动作识别。

Conclusion: 建模手部和身体的相互依赖动态对于双手活动的整体理解至关重要，联合手-身体建模能显著提升动作识别性能。

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出跨模态对比遗忘框架CCU，通过选择性视觉遗忘、跨模态知识保留和双集对比分离来解决多模态应用中视觉隐私泄露问题，在保持其他模态性能的同时显著提升准确性和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实多模态应用中视觉模态最易泄露隐私，现有遗忘方法在视觉遗忘时会损害跨模态知识和类内结构稳定性，导致整体性能下降

Method: CCU框架包含三个关键组件：选择性视觉遗忘（使用反向对比学习分离视觉表示与原语义）、跨模态知识保留（通过语义一致性保持其他模态区分性）、双集对比分离（隔离遗忘集和保留集的结构扰动）

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，CCU相比最优基线准确率提升7.12%，且仅需7%的遗忘时间

Conclusion: CCU框架有效解决了多模态视觉遗忘中的跨模态知识保持和结构稳定性问题，在隐私保护和模型性能间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Motivation: 解决需要同时理解图像和文本的临床难题是医疗AI面临的主要挑战，现有方法在处理复杂医学推理任务时仍有局限。

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换将医学图像和文本特征转换到频域，结合量子检索系统从外部源获取医学知识，并将这些信息与频域特征融合进行推理。

Conclusion: 频率域和量子信息的结合提高了模型性能和可解释性，为构建智能、清晰且有用的医生AI工具提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Abstract: The LifeCLEFs plant identification task provides a testbed for a
system-oriented evaluation of plant identification about 500 species trees and
herbaceous plants. Seven types of image content are considered: scan and
scan-like pictures of leaf, and 6 kinds of detailed views with unconstrained

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合类别条件扩散重放和弹性权重巩固的持续学习框架，用于医学影像基础模型的隐私保护适应，无需存储患者样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像基础模型需要随时间适应，但完全重新训练受到隐私约束和成本的限制。

Method: 使用紧凑的Vision Transformer骨干网络，结合类别条件扩散重放和弹性权重巩固，避免存储患者样本。

Result: 在CheXpert上达到0.851 AUROC，相比DER++减少遗忘超过30%，接近联合训练的0.869 AUROC，同时保持高效和隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床影像模型的可扩展、隐私感知持续适应提供了实用途径，分析显示遗忘与重放保真度和Fisher加权参数漂移相关。

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,
privacy aware continual adaptation of clinical imaging models.

TL;DR: 提出FedDA框架解决联邦学习中医疗图像多模态异质性问题，通过特征级对抗学习实现跨域分割


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗联邦学习中，不同客户端可能拥有不同模态的医学图像，这种异质性给跨域医学图像分割带来重大挑战

Method: 提出FedDA框架，通过嵌入对抗训练机制在客户端间对齐特征图，实现特征级对抗学习

Result: 在三个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，FedDA实现了跨域联邦聚合，赋予单模态客户端跨模态处理能力

Conclusion: FedDA框架能有效增强模型在多域上的泛化能力，减轻域偏移的负面影响，在客观和主观评估中均表现优异

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了EditScore奖励模型系列，通过系统化的基准测试和奖励建模，解决了图像编辑中强化学习缺乏高质量奖励信号的问题，成功实现了高效的策略优化。


<details>

Motivation: 当前指令引导的图像编辑模型在处理复杂指令时仍面临挑战，且需要多次尝试才能获得理想结果。强化学习虽提供解决方案，但缺乏高保真、高效的奖励信号阻碍了其在图像编辑领域的应用。

Method: 首先建立EditReward-Bench基准系统评估奖励模型；然后开发EditScore系列奖励模型（7B-72B），通过精细数据筛选和自集成策略；最后将高质量奖励模型应用于在线强化学习训练。

Result: EditScore在基准测试中性能与学习型专有视觉语言模型相当，最大变体甚至超越GPT-5；基于EditScore的强化学习框架在OmniGen2基础模型上实现了显著且一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统化地实现了从基准测试到奖励建模再到强化学习训练的完整路径，证明高保真、领域专业化的奖励模型是释放强化学习在图像编辑领域潜力的关键。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么将多人视为单一实体直接生成交互，要么仅依赖单方动作生成反应，缺乏对丰富语义信息的整合，在自适应响应能力方面存在不足

Method: 使用扩散模型顺序解耦全局轨迹和局部动作生成，引入交互损失函数增强近距离交互的真实性

Result: 实验证明该方法能够生成逼真、多样且可控的反应动作，既能匹配对手动作又能遵循文本指导

Conclusion: MoReact方法在文本驱动的人类反应生成任务中表现出色，为计算机视觉和人机交互应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实验分析多任务学习中的优化不平衡问题，发现任务特定梯度范数与优化不平衡强相关，并提出基于梯度范数缩放任务损失的简单策略，可达到与昂贵网格搜索相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习（MTL）旨在通过单一网络同时执行多个任务来构建通用视觉系统，但其潜力常因任务干扰导致的优化不平衡而受限，性能不如单任务模型。

Method: 进行系统实验分析，研究现有优化方法在不同数据集上的表现不一致性，分析视觉基础模型（VFMs）和数据量的影响，并发现优化不平衡与任务特定梯度范数的强相关性。

Result: 实验证实现有优化方法性能在不同数据集上不一致，先进架构仍依赖昂贵的网格搜索损失权重；视觉基础模型提供强初始化但无法解决优化不平衡；增加数据量收益有限；基于梯度范数缩放任务损失的简单策略可达到与网格搜索相当的性能。

Conclusion: 理解和控制梯度动态是比开发复杂方法更直接实现稳定多任务学习的路径，梯度范数与优化不平衡的相关性为简单有效的解决方案提供了关键洞见。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了CLIP模型在多任务下的对抗样本迁移行为，发现细粒度任务生成的对抗样本具有更强的跨任务迁移能力，并提出了MT-AdvCLIP框架来增强对抗攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型在细粒度任务上表现不佳，且其对抗鲁棒性研究不足。理解对抗样本在不同任务间的迁移机制对于评估CLIP的泛化极限和安全风险至关重要。

Method: 提出MT-AdvCLIP框架，引入任务感知特征聚合损失，生成具有增强跨任务泛化能力的扰动，从而增强细粒度任务模型对共享CLIP骨干网络的攻击效果。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验表明，MT-AdvCLIP显著提高了对抗迁移成功率（多个任务的平均攻击成功率提升超过39%），且不增加扰动预算。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了多任务CLIP模型中对抗样本的迁移机制，为多任务鲁棒性评估和对抗样本设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

Result: 在几乎所有指标上都优于现有最先进方法，提供更优的视觉结果。

Conclusion: Token Painter方法有效解决了文本引导图像修复中的文本对齐和背景一致性问题，无需训练即可实现卓越性能。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

Conclusion: 该方法能够理解全局模型行为、解释个体预测，并通过干预产生反事实或纠正错误，为深度网络的可解释性提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在视觉令牌冗余，但传统剪枝方法采用固定的层特定剪枝策略，无法适应不同输入样本和任务的复杂度变化，无法与模型的整体推理轨迹对齐。

Method: AutoPrune通过量化视觉和文本令牌的互信息，将其投影到预算约束的逻辑保留曲线上，每个逻辑曲线对应不同任务的特定复杂度，确保满足预定义的计算约束。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上，AutoPrune剪除89%视觉令牌，减少76.8%推理FLOPs，同时保持96.7%原始精度，相比PDrop方法提升9.1%。

Conclusion: AutoPrune通过复杂度自适应剪枝策略，有效平衡了计算效率和模型性能，为视觉语言模型的高效部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at
https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/AutoPrune.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯溅射的汽车损伤检测方法，通过单视图分割实现3D损伤分割，解决了多视图一致性方法在损伤检测中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有汽车损伤检测方法主要基于2D图像分析，缺乏3D几何信息。3D重建方法能提供更全面的损伤表征，但多视图一致性方法在损伤检测中不实用，因为损伤（如划痕、小凹陷）往往只在单个视图中清晰可见。

Method: 提出自动汽车损伤检测流程：1）通过2D掩码上采样进行3D损伤分割；2）提出无需学习的单视图3D高斯溅射分割方法，利用SfM获取相机参数，通过Z缓冲和深度/不透明度正态分布模型过滤高斯点。

Result: 该方法在具有挑战性的汽车损伤检测场景中表现优异，特别是当目标物体（划痕、小凹陷）仅在单个视图中清晰可见时，多视图一致性方法不可行的情况下仍能有效工作。

Conclusion: 提出的单视图3D高斯溅射分割方法为汽车损伤检测提供了一种有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

progressive model pre-training, aggressive model post-training, and an
efficient infrastructure that enables large-scale training and inference. With
these advancements, we successfully trained a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model
comprising over 80 billion parameters in total, with 13 billion parameters
activated per token during inference, making it the largest and most powerful
open-source image generative model to date. We conducted extensive experiments
and the results of automatic and human evaluation of text-image alignment and
visual quality demonstrate that HunyuanImage 3.0 rivals previous
state-of-the-art models. By releasing the code and weights of HunyuanImage 3.0,
we aim to enable the community to explore new ideas with a state-of-the-art
foundation model, fostering a dynamic and vibrant multimodal ecosystem. All

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large
language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a
module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in
the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal
Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that
better reflect real-world reasoning demands.

TL;DR: 提出了RLIR框架，通过逆向动力学模型从生成视频中恢复输入动作，为视频世界模型提供可验证的奖励信号，提升动作跟随能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频世界模型在视觉质量和时间一致性方面有进步，但在准确建模人类指定动作方面研究不足，且传统强化学习方法因大规模偏好标注成本高和基于规则的视频验证器不可行而难以应用。

Method: 使用逆向动力学模型将高维视频模态映射到低维动作空间，通过恢复输入动作来获得可验证的奖励信号，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization进行优化。

Result: 在自回归和扩散范式下，动作跟随能力提升5-10%，视觉质量提升高达10%，获得更高的人类偏好评分。

Conclusion: RLIR是首个专门设计用于增强视频世界模型动作跟随能力的后训练方法，有效解决了动作建模的挑战。

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自适应CNN、CDF9/7小波和n-scroll混沌系统的智能分类方法，用于甲状腺癌超声图像诊断，在DDTI数据集上达到98.17%准确率，优于现有SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲状腺癌全球发病率上升，及时准确的诊断对治疗策略和患者预后至关重要。

Method: 将自适应CNN与CDF9/7小波结合，小波细节系数通过n-scroll混沌系统调制以增强判别特征。

Result: 在DDTI数据集上达到98.17%准确率、98.76%灵敏度、97.58%特异性、97.55% F1-score和0.9912 AUC，优于EfficientNetV2-S等SOTA方法。混沌调制使准确率提升8.79个百分点。

Conclusion: 小波-混沌-CNN管道在甲状腺超声分类中达到最先进水平，具有强泛化能力和实用运行特性，适合临床集成。

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VFSI方法，在扩散采样过程中通过基于能量的引导来强制执行物理约束，无需重新训练模型，显著提高了交通模拟的物理有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型生成的交通模拟虽然逼真，但系统性地违反物理约束，50%的轨迹存在碰撞、驶离道路等问题，需要解决物理有效性这一根本限制。

Method: 使用基于能量的引导方法，在扩散采样过程中将碰撞避免和运动学约束作为能量函数，引导去噪过程生成物理有效的轨迹。

Result: 在Waymo数据集200个场景中，碰撞率降低67%（24.6%到8.1%），总体有效性提高87%（50.3%到94.2%），同时ADE指标从1.34米提升到1.21米。

Conclusion: 在推理过程中显式强制执行约束对于物理有效的交通模拟既是必要的也是充分的，模型无关的方法具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

TL;DR: 提出OASIS，一种高效的一步扩散模型，通过注意力专业化路由和渐进训练策略解决视频超分辨率中的冗余问题，在性能和推理速度上均取得显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用生成扩散模型到视频超分辨率会导致冗余，因为低质量视频已包含大量内容信息，这增加了计算开销和学习负担

Method: 采用注意力专业化路由机制，根据注意力头的内在行为将其分配到不同模式；提出渐进训练策略，从时间一致退化开始训练，再转向不一致设置

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上达到最先进性能，相比SeedVR2等一步扩散基线提供6.2倍加速

Conclusion: OASIS通过减少冗余和有效保留预训练知识，使扩散模型更好地适应视频超分辨率任务，实现了性能与效率的平衡

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度图像在各领域应用日益增多，但获取大规模标注数据集困难，需要开发无需训练的鲁棒深度估计方法。

Method: 将360度图像转换为六面立方体贴图，使用透视基础模型估计深度和表面法线，通过图优化对齐不同面的深度尺度。

Result: 在Matterport3D、Stanford2D3D和360Loc等多个数据集上表现优异，在下游任务中特征匹配AUC@5提升3.2~5.4%，SfM提升0.2~9.7%。

Conclusion: RPG360通过结合基础模型和图优化，实现了无需训练的鲁棒360度深度估计，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed
treatment initiation. In this work, we introduce TREAT-Net, a multimodal deep
learning framework for ACS treatment prediction that leverages non-invasive
modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video
interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across
modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy
for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of

particularly in underserved populations with limited access to coronary
angiography.

Conclusion: SIE3D框架成功实现了从单张图像和文本描述生成高质量、表情可控的3D头部化身，解决了现有方法的控制精度问题。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,
as current methods lack fine-grained, intuitive control over expressions via
text. This paper proposes SIE3D, a framework that generates expressive 3D
avatars from a single image and descriptive text. SIE3D fuses identity features
from the image with semantic embedding from text through a novel conditioning
scheme, enabling detailed control. To ensure generated expressions accurately
match the text, it introduces an innovative perceptual expression loss
function. This loss uses a pre-trained expression classifier to regularize the
generation process, guaranteeing expression accuracy. Extensive experiments
show SIE3D significantly improves controllability and realism, outperforming
competitive methods in identity preservation and expression fidelity on a
single consumer-grade GPU. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解模型采用固定的帧采样策略，无法根据具体问题的推理需求自适应地收集视觉证据，导致在需要广泛时间覆盖或精细空间细节的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出FrameMind框架，使用FiCOT实现多轮交替推理和视觉感知，通过动态分辨率帧采样(DRFS)和DRFS-GRPO算法训练动态采样策略，无需帧级标注。

Result: 在MLVU和VideoMME等挑战性基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有模型，推进了灵活高效视频理解的技术水平。

Conclusion: FrameMind通过动态视觉信息请求机制，实现了更灵活高效的视频理解，为自适应视频分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对高光谱图像的广义类别发现框架，通过原型子空间建模来更好地捕捉类别结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GCD方法主要针对RGB图像，其假设和建模策略无法很好地泛化到高光谱图像，因为HSI具有高维性和复杂的光谱结构

Method: 使用一组基向量为每个类别建模子空间表示，而不是像SimGCD等方法那样学习单个原型向量。通过基向量正交性约束和重构约束来指导学习

Result: 在真实世界HSI数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于最先进的GCD方法

Conclusion: 为高光谱环境中的广义类别发现建立了坚实基础

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为恶劣环境下的智能交通系统可靠感知提供了有效的建模范式，在雾霾天气行人轨迹预测任务中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数重建网络在ISP处理后的sRGB图像上训练，但ISP流程会不可逆地混合颜色、裁剪动态范围和模糊细节。本文旨在证明这些损失是可以避免的。

Method: 使用雨退化问题作为用例，评估ISP后和Bayer重建流程，创建Raw-Rain基准数据集，引入信息守恒评分(ICS)指标，开发原始域重建模型。

Result: 在测试集上，原始域模型比sRGB结果提升高达+0.99 dB PSNR和+1.2% ICS，同时运行更快且计算量减半。

Conclusion: 结果支持低层视觉采用ISP后处理范式，为端到端可学习相机管道打开了大门。

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end
learnable camera pipelines.

Conclusion: 提出的联合优化框架能够生成聚类感知的分割，同时保持光谱和空间结构，为高光谱图像分析提供了高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with

*Leonardo Iurada,Beatrice Occhiena,Tatiana Tommasi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，在预训练视觉模型上进行剪枝时，即使使用特定任务数据，剪枝后的模型在未见任务上仍能保持零样本性能，且微调后能恢复被剪枝任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉模型虽然具有可迁移性，但计算和存储成本限制了实际部署。传统剪枝方法需要任务特定数据，但当下游任务未知时存在挑战。

Method: 研究数据对预训练视觉模型剪枝的影响，探索在不同任务数据上进行剪枝的效果。

Result: 意外发现：在一个任务上剪枝后，模型在未见任务上仍保持零样本性能；微调这些剪枝模型不仅能提升原始任务性能，还能恢复被剪枝任务的性能。

Conclusion: 这种现象归因于在大规模数据集上进行广泛预训练所诱导的有利损失景观。

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型视觉语言模型中外部视觉结构如何通过诱导Grounding IDs来改善多模态绑定，减少幻觉并提高推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在多模态基准测试中表现良好，但在结构化推理和精确接地方面仍存在局限。现有研究表明添加简单视觉结构能提高准确性，但其内部机制尚不清楚。

Method: 通过表示分析和因果干预，研究外部线索如何诱导Grounding IDs（潜在标识符），这些标识符在嵌入空间中形成稳健的跨模态对齐，并减少图像与文本之间的模态差距。

Result: 发现Grounding IDs作为符号机制，增强了相关组件之间的注意力，从而改善了跨模态接地并减少了幻觉。这些标识符在嵌入空间中表现为分区内对齐，并介导对象与符号线索之间的绑定。

Conclusion: Grounding IDs是解释外部线索如何增强多模态绑定的关键符号机制，既提供了可解释性，又在实际应用中提高了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

TL;DR: VideoAR是一个统一的视频生成框架，支持多种预测单元（完整帧、关键细节帧、多尺度细化、时空立方体），其中时空立方体作为预测单元在质量和效率上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑帧是否是视频自回归的自然原子单元，挑战传统逐帧预测方法。

Method: 提出VideoAR框架，支持多种预测单元，特别是时空立方体作为预测单元，允许自回归模型同时在空间和时间维度上操作。

Result: 基于立方体的预测在质量、速度和时序一致性方面表现最优，在VBench上超越现有方法，推理更快，并能扩展到分钟级序列。

Conclusion: 这项工作鼓励重新思考视频和其他时空域中的序列分解方法，突破了逐帧预测的限制。

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

Conclusion: SVAC通过扩展输入帧和分割token，结合有效的压缩和分配策略，显著提升了RVOS的性能和效率。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational
and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex
temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code

TL;DR: GMS框架通过结合通用视觉语言模型和专用GUI定位模型，采用从粗到细的方法显著提升GUI界面中自然语言查询的定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在图形用户界面中定位自然语言查询的挑战，该任务需要理解多样化的UI元素并准确预测空间坐标。

Method: 提出GMS框架：通用VLM作为'Scanner'识别感兴趣区域，专用定位模型作为'Locator'在区域内输出精确坐标，采用五阶段分层搜索和跨模态通信。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上，单独使用Scanner和Locator的准确率仅为2.0%和3.7%，但GMS框架集成后达到35.7%准确率，提升10倍，显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: GMS框架通过协同粗到细的方法有效提升了GUI定位性能，展示了其在通用GUI定位任务中的鲁棒性和潜力。

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing
socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some
form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at
$411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by
ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning
has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and
achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an
automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale
Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and
ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global
benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability,
we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)
technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific

Motivation: 揭示AI系统在面部美感预测中存在的种族偏见问题，即使数据源看似平衡，AI仍会放大而非缓解社会审美偏见，警告AI在塑造审美规范中的风险。

Method: 使用SCUT-FBP5500和MEBeauty数据集训练模型，通过严格的统计验证（Kruskal-Wallis H检验和Dunn事后分析），在平衡的FairFace数据集上进行跨数据集验证。

Result: 两个模型在不同种族群体间都表现出显著的预测差异（p < 0.001），只有4.8-9.5%的组间比较满足分布均等标准，表明当前AI美感预测方法存在不足。

Conclusion: 当前AI美感预测方法存在严重偏见问题，需要开发缓解策略来构建更公平的美感技术，避免AI对社会审美偏见的进一步强化。

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current
AI beauty prediction approaches, with only 4.8-9.5\% of inter-group comparisons
satisfying distributional parity criteria. Mitigation strategies are proposed
and discussed in detail.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

Conclusion: 该研究为矢状面脊柱评估提供了有前景的无辐射解决方案，推进了AIS的综合评估。

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,
overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address
this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric
structure of parameter trajectories, and an easy-to-complex matching strategy
that progressively addresses parameters based on their complexity. Experiments
on medical image classification tasks demonstrate that our method improves
distillation performance while preserving privacy and maintaining model
accuracy comparable to training on the original datasets. Our code is available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细粒度图像分类中，由于类间差异细微，评估样本的信息量特别具有挑战性。现有方法难以有效感知细粒度图像间的区别性。

Method: 引入多方面的信息量度量，结合差异-混淆不确定性和校准多样性。差异-混淆不确定性量化了局部特征融合过程中细粒度未标记数据的类别方向性和结构稳定性，然后进行不确定性加权聚类来多样化不确定性样本，最后校准多样性以最大化所选样本的全局多样性同时保持其局部代表性。

Conclusion: DECERN方法通过结合不确定性和多样性度量，能够有效选择信息量丰富的样本，在细粒度图像分类的主动学习中表现出色。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

TL;DR: 提出TaSe框架，通过解构语言表示中的对象、属性和关系，并层次化聚合，显著提升了视觉语言模型在复杂查询下的目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理包含描述性属性和关系从句的复杂查询时表现有限，主要原因是文本编码器无法有效分离目标对象与其描述属性和关系。

Method: 提出TaSe框架：1)构建层次化合成字幕数据集；2)Talk in Pieces模块通过解构损失函数将文本嵌入分解为对象、属性和关系三个子空间；3)See in Whole模块学习将解构组件层次化聚合。

Result: 在OmniLabel基准测试中实现了24%的性能提升，证明了语言组合性的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过引入层次化语言结构归纳偏置，TaSe框架能够生成细粒度的多模态表示，有效提升基于语言的目标检测性能。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种高效的3D深度学习框架T1C-RFlow，能够从多参数MRI预对比图像生成T1对比增强图像，解决了钆基对比剂使用限制和成像不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钆基对比剂在T1加权MRI中常用于增强病灶可视化，但在有肾源性系统性纤维化风险的患者中受限，且对比剂使用变化会导致成像不一致。

Method: 提出3D潜在整流流模型(T1C-RFlow)，首先将T1w和T2-FLAIR图像输入预训练自编码器获得潜在空间表示，然后在潜在空间中训练整流流扩散模型。

Result: T1C-RFlow在定性和定量评估中均优于基准3D模型，在三个数据集上获得优异指标，且去噪时间显著更快(6.9秒/体积)。

Conclusion: 该方法生成与真实T1C图像高度相似的合成图像，且速度远超传统扩散模型，有望发展为脑肿瘤无对比剂MRI的实用方法。

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding
capabilities is increasingly important but faces two key challenges:
maintaining semantic faithfulness during flow-based generation due to
text-visual token imbalance and the limitations of uniform cross-modal
attention across the flow trajectory, and efficiently extending image-centric
MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a

TL;DR: BALR-SAM是一个边界感知的低秩自适应框架，用于增强SAM在医学图像分割中的性能，通过仅更新1.8%的参数实现优于全参数微调MedSAM的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉基础模型在医学图像分割中因缺乏领域特定适应而表现不佳的问题，同时满足临床实践中对高效微调、低资源需求和强性能的要求。

Method: 结合三个组件：互补细节增强网络（CDEN）捕获边界敏感特征；低秩适配器优化特征表示和注意力；低秩张量注意力机制减少内存使用并提升推理速度。

Result: 在标准医学分割数据集上，无需提示即可超越多个SOTA方法，包括全参数微调的MedSAM，同时仅更新11.7M参数（占总参数1.8%）。

Conclusion: BALR-SAM通过边界感知和低秩自适应策略，有效解决了医学图像分割中的领域适应问题，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算资源需求。

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

Conclusion: Forge4D能够高效地从非标定稀疏视角视频重建动态3D人体，支持新视角和新时间合成，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

Method: 提出了双模态掩码策略，增强模态编码器的整体设计，引入迭代音频-视觉相关性学习模块，以及渐进式语义注入策略，将模型训练组织为三个结构化阶段。

Conclusion: AVF-MAE++通过创新的双模态掩码和相关性学习机制，有效解决了AVFA领域的缩放和跨模态建模挑战，为情感视频面部分析提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

Abstract: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems
remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning
processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present
EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify
broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and
testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global
datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties:
dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology.
External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional
datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to
assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with
pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation
for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858)
and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models.
In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across
nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External
validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with
competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training
strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not
only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step

Conclusion: LVR通过直接在视觉嵌入空间进行推理，显著改善了细粒度视觉理解和感知能力

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

Conclusion: CoTAM通过自适应保护多级特征，有效解决了MLLMs图像压缩问题，在比特率节省和任务性能保持方面表现优异。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing

Method: 引入循环训练框架，通过循环约束强制生成图像与原始图像之间的一致性，实现更可靠的直接和反事实生成

Result: 在组合的3D脑部MRI数据集上实验显示，该方法提高了条件准确性和图像质量（FID和SSIM指标）

Conclusion: CDM中的循环策略是优化基于扩散的医学图像生成的有效方法，适用于数据增强、反事实和疾病进展建模

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality
synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,
counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhiqiang Tian,Jinling Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于骨架的鲁棒点云配准框架SRRF，通过引入抗干扰的骨架表示来提升配准的鲁棒性和准确性，在各种点云损坏场景下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的点云常受传感器限制、环境噪声和预处理错误影响，导致密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形，现有配准方法对这些干扰敏感，配准精度下降。

Method: 将骨架结构集成到配准过程中，结合损坏点云对齐和其骨架对齐的变换结果；设计了分布距离损失函数来强制源骨架和目标骨架之间的一致性。

Result: 在多种损坏数据集上的实验评估表明，SRRF在各种损坏场景下（包括密度失真、噪声污染和几何变形）始终优于最先进的配准方法。

Conclusion: SRRF在处理损坏点云方面具有鲁棒性，使其成为现实场景中3D感知任务的潜在方法。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分点云配准在自主感知和3D场景理解中至关重要，但由于结构模糊性、部分可见性和噪声等因素，该任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: CEGC框架包含混合重叠置信度估计模块（集成语义描述符和几何相似性）和上下文感知匹配策略（使用全局注意力分配软置信度分数），指导可微分加权SVD求解器计算精确变换。

Result: 在ModelNet40、ScanObjectNN和7Scenes等3D视觉数据集上的实验表明，CEGC在准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CEGC为具有挑战性条件下的部分点云配准提供了一个可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging
conditions.

TL;DR: ASIA是一个通过少量图像标注实现3D分割的新框架，能够分割非语义和难以用文本描述的3D部件，利用扩散模型将图像空间的分割转移到3D空间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D分割中标注成本高、文本描述不精确的问题，通过少量野外图像标注实现精确的3D部件分割

Method: 利用文本到图像扩散模型的先验知识，优化每个分割段的文本token，使用交叉视图部件对应损失进行微调，通过多视图渲染、UV空间投票融合和噪声优化技术实现3D分割

Result: 在定量和定性评估中都显著优于现有方法，为语义和非语义3D分割任务提供了实用且通用的解决方案

Conclusion: ASIA框架通过少量图像标注实现了高效准确的3D分割，在几何结构差异大的情况下仍能保持良好性能

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: SVGThinker是一个基于推理的文本到SVG生成框架，通过链式思维和渐进式原语添加，解决了传统方法的泛化能力弱和指令遵循差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到SVG生成中的两个主要问题：弱泛化能力和对输入指令的遵循性差，同时充分利用SVG作为代码表示的结构优势。

Method: 提出SVGThinker框架：1）顺序渲染每个SVG原语并用多模态模型标注图像和代码；2）构建反映原语增量添加的逐步更新；3）通过监督微调训练LLM，暴露其链式思维作为中间推理。

Result: 相比最先进的基线方法，SVGThinker生成更稳定、可编辑且质量更高的SVG，同时保持矢量图形的结构优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为设计、内容创作和自动化图形生成开辟了新方向，与基于图像的方法不同，其输出支持精确和分层编辑。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

TL;DR: 提出FrameThinker框架，让大型视觉语言模型能够通过迭代询问视频内容来处理长视频推理任务，显著减少处理帧数并提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在长视频理解中存在统一帧采样和静态文本推理的局限性，导致效率低下且难以处理视觉密集型视频任务

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：先通过监督微调培养基本动作能力，再通过强化学习优化战略决策策略，并对每个动作和格式奖励进行深入全面的奖励设计探索

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中平均提升10.4%，7B模型在LongVideo-Reason上达到76.1%准确率，仅使用20.6帧，比竞争方法减少20倍帧数

Conclusion: FrameThinker框架在长视频推理任务中实现了前所未有的效率和效果，建立了新的最先进水平

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

TL;DR: OMeGa是一个端到端框架，联合优化显式三角网格和2D高斯溅射，通过灵活的绑定策略解决室内无纹理区域几何重建不准确的问题，并集成网格约束和单目法线监督来正则化几何学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个局限性：(i) 在无纹理室内区域几何重建不准确；(ii) 网格提取与优化解耦，错失了利用网格几何指导溅射优化的机会。

Method: 提出OMeGa框架，联合优化三角网格和2D高斯溅射，采用灵活绑定策略将高斯溅射的空间属性表达在网格框架中，同时保留纹理属性在溅射上。集成网格约束和单目法线监督，并提出启发式迭代网格细化策略。

Result: 在具有挑战性的室内重建基准测试中达到最先进性能，将Chamfer-L1距离比2DGS基线减少47.3%，同时保持竞争力的新视角渲染质量。

Conclusion: OMeGa有效解决了先前室内无纹理重建中的局限性，证明了联合优化网格和溅射的可行性。

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance
visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while
recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs
due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel
method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling
high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By
implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's
linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map
effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 使用几何投影将多摄像头特征对齐到统一地面平面，通过三平面融合提取单视角特征并解码场景级密度图。

Result: 在密集遮挡场景下达到95.1%的准确率，显著优于单视角和传统融合方法，表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TP-MVCC模型在智能农业中具有实际应用潜力，能有效解决密集动物计数问题。

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult
in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and

TL;DR: SphereAR通过将自回归模型的输入输出约束在固定半径的超球面上，解决了VAE潜在空间中异质方差导致的方差崩溃问题，在图像生成任务上超越了扩散模型和掩码生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续token自回归模型在图像生成中表现不如潜在扩散和掩码生成模型，主要原因是VAE潜在空间中的异质方差在自回归解码过程中被放大，特别是在分类器无关引导下会导致方差崩溃。

Method: 提出SphereAR方法，将所有自回归输入输出（包括CFG后）约束在固定半径的超球面上，利用超球面VAE去除尺度分量，稳定自回归解码过程。

Result: 在ImageNet生成任务上，SphereAR-H（943M参数）达到FID 1.34，创下自回归模型新纪录；较小规模的SphereAR-L（479M）和SphereAR-B（208M）分别达到FID 1.54和1.92，超越或匹配了更大规模的基线模型。

Conclusion: 这是首次纯next-token自回归图像生成器在可比参数规模下超越扩散和掩码生成模型，证明了超球面约束在稳定自回归解码中的有效性。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

Motivation: 现有农业视觉问答方法主要针对文本查询或单图像场景，无法处理现实农业场景中需要多图像输入和跨时空尺度的互补视图，且缺乏外部农业知识更新和系统质量控制。

Method: 设计四角色多智能体框架：检索器负责查询和收集外部信息，反思器评估充分性并触发重新检索，两个回答器并行生成候选答案以减少偏见，改进器通过迭代检查精炼答案并确保多图像信息有效对齐。

Result: 在AgMMU基准测试中，该框架在多图像农业问答任务上取得了有竞争力的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该自反思、自改进的多智能体框架能够有效处理农业视觉问答中的多图像输入和知识不足问题，为现实农业场景提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

TL;DR: NeRV-Diffusion是一个隐式潜在视频扩散模型，通过生成神经网络权重来合成视频。该模型将视频压缩并生成为一个统一的神经网络，避免了传统视频生成中的跨帧注意力机制，实现了高效高质量的视频合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频生成方法需要处理跨帧的时序依赖关系，计算复杂度高。NeRV-Diffusion旨在通过将视频表示为统一的神经网络权重，实现更高效和高质量的视频合成。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）基于超网络的tokenizer将视频从像素空间编码到神经参数空间；2）隐式扩散变换器在潜在INR权重上进行去噪。通过重用瓶颈潜在和重新设计权重分配、上采样连接和输入坐标，实现高斯分布的INR权重。

Result: 在UCF-101和Kinetics-600等真实世界视频基准测试中，NeRV-Diffusion达到了优于先前INR基模型的视频生成质量，并与最新的非隐式模型性能相当。同时提供了平滑的INR权重空间，支持帧间或视频间的无缝插值。

Conclusion: NeRV-Diffusion展示了通过生成神经网络权重来合成视频的可行性，提供了一种高效且高质量的视频生成方法，同时保持了良好的插值特性。

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

### [248] [DRIFT: Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations for Robust Adversarial Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24359)
*Amira Guesmi,Muhammad Shafique*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种通过主动破坏梯度共识来防御对抗性攻击的随机集成方法，通过最大化Jacobian和logit空间的响应差异来增强模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对对抗性攻击高度脆弱，现有防御方法在梯度可估计时容易失效。研究发现梯度共识是导致对抗性可迁移性的关键因素。

Method: 提出DRIFT方法，使用轻量级可学习滤波器的随机集成，通过预测一致性、Jacobian分离、logit空间分离和对抗鲁棒性训练来强制梯度不和谐。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，DRIFT在CNN和Vision Transformers上实现了显著的鲁棒性提升，优于最先进的预处理、对抗训练和基于扩散的防御方法。

Conclusion: 梯度分歧是构建实用且可泛化对抗防御的有效原则，DRIFT以可忽略的运行时间和内存成本提供了强大的防御能力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus} -- the tendency of randomized transformations to
yield aligned gradients -- as a key driver of adversarial transferability.
Attackers exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain
effective across transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent
Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight,
learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior
randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces
\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and
logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions
are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical
analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a
consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency,
Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and
(iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet
across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art
preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under
adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers
these improvements with negligible runtime and memory cost, establishing
gradient divergence as a practical and generalizable principle for adversarial
defense.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Uni-X提出了一种两端分离、中间共享的X形架构，解决多模态模型中视觉和文本梯度冲突问题，在3B参数规模下达到或超越7B参数模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于共享自回归变换器的统一多模态模型存在严重梯度冲突问题，特别是在浅层和深层，这是由于图像和文本在低层统计特性上的根本差异导致的

Method: 采用两端分离、中间共享的X形架构：初始和最终层用于模态特定处理，中间层保持共享参数进行高级语义融合

Result: 在相同训练条件下，Uni-X实现了更优的训练效率。3B参数规模下，在图像生成任务中获得82的GenEval分数，并在文本和视觉理解任务中表现强劲，匹配或超越7B参数模型

Conclusion: Uni-X为未来统一多模态建模提供了一个参数高效且可扩展的基础架构

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

*Jinhee Park,Guisik Kim,Choongsang Cho,Junseok Kwon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的模型融合框架R²M，用于深度伪造检测。通过低秩分解估计共享的真实成分，分解专家模型为真实对齐部分和伪造残差，通过秩截断去噪残差，并采用每任务范数匹配进行聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造生成器快速演进，使得穷尽数据收集和重复训练变得不切实际。模型融合天然适合深度伪造检测，因为专家模型共享相同的二元决策，仅在生成器特定伪影上有所不同。

Method: R²M框架：1）通过任务向量的低秩分解估计共享真实成分；2）将每个专家模型分解为真实对齐部分和伪造残差；3）使用层间秩截断对残差去噪；4）通过每任务范数匹配聚合残差，防止单一生成器主导。

Result: 在分布内、跨数据集和未见数据集上，R²M均优于联合训练和其他融合基线方法。该方法具有可组合性，当新伪造家族出现时，只需微调一个专家模型并重新融合，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: R²M通过参数空间融合有效解决了深度伪造检测中的数据收集和重复训练问题，在保持真实表示的同时衰减伪造特定线索，实现了高效且可扩展的检测框架。

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合扩散模型和条件GAN的混合框架，从卫星图像生成地理一致的街景图像，在CVUSA数据集上表现优于纯扩散方法，并与最先进的GAN方法竞争。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 街景图像是地理空间数据收集和城市分析的重要来源，但从卫星图像合成街景图像面临外观和视角差异的挑战。

Method: 采用多阶段训练策略，以Stable Diffusion为核心组件构建双分支架构，集成条件GAN生成地理一致的街景全景图，并通过融合策略结合两种模型的优势。

Result: 在CVUSA数据集上的实验表明，该混合方法在多个评估指标上优于纯扩散方法，与最先进的GAN方法性能相当，能生成具有几何一致性和视觉质量的街景图像。

Conclusion: 该混合框架成功生成了真实且几何一致的街景图像，保留了细粒度局部细节，为跨视图图像合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as
clouds.

TL;DR: DINOReg是一个点云配准网络，通过融合DINOv2提取的视觉特征和几何特征，在RGB-D数据上实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖几何信息，虽然有些方法引入了颜色信息，但未能充分利用图像中的丰富纹理和语义信息，且特征融合存在信息损失。

Method: 使用DINOv2提取图像视觉特征，在patch级别融合视觉和几何特征，并提出混合位置编码来同时编码图像空间和点云空间的位置信息。

Result: 在RGBD-3DMatch和RGBD-3DLoMatch数据集上，相比最先进的几何方法和多模态方法，patch内点率提升14.2%，配准召回率提升15.7%。

Conclusion: 充分融合视觉和几何信息能显著提升点云配准性能，DINOv2等视觉基础模型为多模态配准提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 亚米级遥感图像具有丰富的视觉细节，但缺乏高质量标注数据集，现有标注方法不可靠或成本过高，限制了其在大规模土地覆盖制图中的应用。

Method: 基于空间自相关原理，将语义一致的掩码组作为最小标注单元，实现多个实例的同时高效标注。

Result: 构建了HiCity-LC数据集，支持在五个主要中国城市生成城市尺度的土地覆盖图，分类精度超过85%，是首个公开可用的亚米级城市级土地覆盖基准。

Conclusion: MCAE展示了在大规模亚米级制图中的可扩展性和实用价值，显著提高了标注效率同时保持了标签质量、语义多样性和空间代表性。

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: REALIGN是一个基于正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输的自监督程序学习框架，能够处理教学视频中的背景片段、重复动作和非单调步骤顺序，相比传统方法在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的教学数据通常包含背景片段、重复动作和乱序步骤，这种变异性违反了传统对齐方法的强单调性假设。现有方法如OPEL仅依赖特征相似性，无法捕捉任务的高阶时间结构。

Method: 提出R-FPGWOT（正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输），联合建模视觉对应关系和时间关系，采用部分对齐方案处理不相关帧、重复动作和非单调步骤顺序。结合序列间对比学习稳定训练。

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask基准测试中，REALIGN实现了高达18.9%的平均F1分数提升和超过30%的时间IoU增益，同时产生更可解释的传输映射，保留关键步骤顺序并过滤噪声。

Conclusion: REALIGN通过融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输有效解决了程序学习中的对齐挑战，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，并提供了更可解释的结果。

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

Conclusion: Vid-LLM通过视频输入实现3D场景理解，无需外部3D数据，具有更好的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了PCICF框架，用于系统识别和分类弱势道路使用者（VRU）情境，支持自动驾驶出租车（robotaxi）的运营设计域（ODD）事故分析。该框架基于合成数据集SMIRK扩展为MoreSMIRK数据集，使用空间填充曲线（SFCs）进行多维特征匹配，并在真实数据集PIE上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶出租车在各国商业化部署，需要在特定运营设计域内可靠检测弱势道路使用者（如行人、自行车骑手等）。端到端AI系统需要高质量数据来训练和评估，但目前缺乏系统化的VRU情境识别和分类方法。

Method: 1. 基于SMIRK合成数据集扩展为MoreSMIRK数据集，构建多行人穿越情境的结构化字典；2. 使用空间填充曲线（SFCs）将场景的多维特征转换为特征模式；3. 与MoreSMIRK中的条目进行匹配；4. 在包含150多个手动标注行人穿越视频的PIE真实数据集上进行评估。

Conclusion: PCICF提供了一个有效的框架来系统识别和分类VRU情境，支持自动驾驶系统的安全分析和评估。该方法具有实际应用潜力，特别是在自动驾驶出租车的运营监控和事故分析方面。

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

spatio-angular latent space, encoding both the spatial appearance and angular
viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and

strategically decomposing our training process into multiple steps. We
demonstrate that RapidMV outperforms existing methods in terms of consistency
and latency, with competitive quality and text-image alignment.

TL;DR: CLQ是一种针对扩散变换器(DiTs)的跨层引导正交量化方法，通过交叉块校准、正交平滑和跨层参数搜索三个关键技术，在W4A4量化下实现3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速，同时保持视觉质量和指标几乎无损。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)的模型规模和复杂性增长虽然提升了视觉生成质量，但也阻碍了在边缘设备上的实际部署。模型后训练量化(PTQ)作为高效模型压缩技术，在减少内存消耗和加速推理的同时会带来性能下降。

Method: CLQ包含三个关键设计：1)交叉块校准(CBC)获取准确的校准数据；2)正交平滑(OBS)量化每个通道的异常值分数，利用块Hadamard矩阵平滑异常值；3)跨层参数搜索(CLPS)进行参数搜索。

Result: 在图像生成和视频生成模型上评估，成功将模型压缩为W4A4量化，视觉质量和指标仅有可忽略的下降，实现3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速。

Conclusion: CLQ方法有效解决了DiTs量化中的性能下降问题，为边缘设备部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型架构成熟，数据质量成为关键因素，但图像领域缺乏系统性的数据集质量评估研究。

Method: 使用CIFAKE数据集识别常见质量问题，结合CleanVision和Fastdup工具开发质量评估流程，引入自动阈值选择方法检测问题图像。

Result: 自动阈值方法在单扰动下将F1分数从0.6794提升到0.9468，双扰动下从0.7447提升到0.8557；去重策略将F1分数从0.4576提升到0.7928。

Conclusion: 卷积神经网络对模糊和严重下采样等关键特征遮挡的退化特别敏感，该工作流程有效提升了图像数据质量评估效果。

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under

near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score

workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

TL;DR: Proxy-GS是一种新颖的3D高斯溅射方法，通过代理系统引入遮挡感知，加速渲染并提高视觉质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯溅射方法在大型场景中仍存在显著冗余，主要原因是缺乏遮挡感知能力

Method: 提出快速代理系统，能在1ms内生成1000x1000分辨率的精确遮挡深度图，用于引导锚点和高斯剔除以及训练时的致密化

Result: 在MatrixCity Streets等遮挡严重场景中，Proxy-GS不仅增强了MLP基高斯溅射的渲染能力，还实现了超过2.5倍的加速

Conclusion: Proxy-GS通过引入遮挡感知代理，有效解决了3D高斯溅射中的冗余问题，显著提升了渲染速度和质量

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

TL;DR: DCFlow是一个新颖的无监督跨模态光流估计框架，采用解耦优化策略和跨模态一致性约束，通过协同训练模态转换网络和光流估计网络来解决模态差异和几何错位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅从外观相似性隐式学习光流估计，无法有效处理模态差异和几何错位问题，需要更明确的监督和约束机制。

Method: 提出解耦优化策略，分别训练模态转换网络和光流估计网络；使用几何感知数据合成管道和异常鲁棒损失进行可靠运动监督；引入跨模态一致性约束联合优化两个网络。

Result: DCFlow可与多种光流估计网络集成，在构建的综合跨模态光流基准上实现了无监督方法中的最先进性能。

Conclusion: DCFlow通过解耦优化和跨模态一致性约束有效解决了跨模态光流估计中的模态差异和几何错位问题，为无监督跨模态运动估计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了UI2V-Bench基准测试，专注于评估图像到视频生成模型的语义理解和推理能力，填补现有评估主要关注视频质量和时间一致性的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到视频生成评估基准主要关注视频质量和时间一致性，但忽视了模型对输入图像特定主体语义的理解能力，以及生成视频是否符合物理规律和人类常识。

Method: 设计了四个主要评估维度：空间理解、属性绑定、类别理解和推理；基于多模态大语言模型开发了两种评估方法：实例级细粒度语义理解管道和基于反馈的推理管道。

Result: 构建了约500个精心设计的文本-图像对，评估了开源和闭源的图像到视频模型，人类评估结果与提出的MLLM指标高度一致。

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench填补了图像到视频评估在语义理解和推理能力方面的关键空白，为该领域未来研究和模型开发提供了稳健的框架和数据集。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

TL;DR: NeoWorld是一个从单张输入图像生成交互式3D虚拟世界的深度学习框架，采用对象中心的3D表示，只在用户探索区域渲染高真实感内容，结合3D前景对象和2D背景合成，支持自然语言控制和物理合理动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受科幻小说《Simulacron-3》按需世界构建概念启发，旨在创建仅在被探索区域渲染高真实感内容的交互式虚拟世界，克服传统全局世界生成或2D幻觉方法的局限性。

Method: 采用混合场景结构：对关键前景对象进行完整3D建模，同时对背景和未交互区域进行2D合成以确保效率。结合先进的表示学习和对象到3D技术，支持灵活视角操作和物理合理场景动画。

Result: 在WorldScore基准测试中显著优于现有的2D和深度分层2.5D方法，能够随着用户交互逐步展开虚拟世界，提供动态、沉浸且视觉一致的探索体验。

Conclusion: NeoWorld框架成功实现了从单张图像生成交互式3D虚拟世界，通过对象中心的混合表示方法平衡了视觉质量和计算效率，为虚拟现实和游戏开发提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

*Jianxin Liang,Tan Yue,Yuxuan Wang,Yueqian Wang,Zhihan Yin,Huishuai Zhang,Dongyan Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架来合成更丰富的监督信号，通过问题转述和问题字幕两种策略，将孤立的事实问答对转化为连贯的叙事段落和细粒度的视觉依据，显著提升了视频问答模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频问答模型的监督信号通常由孤立的事实问答对组成，这种"事实袋"方法无法捕捉事件的叙事和因果结构，限制了模型对视频内容的深度理解。

Method: 提出两种互补策略：问题转述(QBP)将现有问答对中的多样化问题合成为重建视频事件结构的整体叙事段落；问题字幕(QBC)为每个问题生成细粒度的视觉依据，将答案锚定在具体相关证据上。利用生成模型合成数据，在统一的下一词预测目标下训练视频问答模型。

Result: 在STAR和NExT-QA数据集上的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，实现了显著的准确率提升并建立了新的最先进结果：将3B模型在STAR上的准确率提升至72.5%(+4.9%)，将7B模型在NExT-QA上的准确率提升至80.8%。

Conclusion: 将数据合成从孤立事实转向叙事连贯性和有依据的推理，能够产生更准确、高效和可泛化的训练范式，QBP和QBC都显著增强了跨数据集泛化能力，其中QBP还加速了模型收敛超过2.5倍。

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于知识蒸馏的双模型集成方法，结合编码器-解码器和编码器-编码器架构，在工业异常检测和语义异常检测任务上均取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法往往偏向工业检测，难以泛化到语义异常检测任务，反之亦然。现有通用异常检测方法对数据集特定设置和单类任务敏感。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏的双模型集成框架：教师模型和两个学生模型（编码器-解码器模型用于工业异常检测，编码器-编码器模型用于语义异常检测），共享DINOv2预训练编码器，通过Noisy-OR目标联合学习，结合局部和语义异常评分。

Result: 在8个公开基准测试中均取得最先进准确率：MVTec-AD图像级AUROC达99.7%，CIFAR-10达97.8%，在多类和单类设置下均优于先前通用异常检测模型和最佳专业模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在多个异常检测领域展现出良好的泛化能力，成功桥接了工业异常检测和语义异常检测之间的性能差距。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的文本到运动生成虽然能产生高质量运动，但难以实现细粒度的表现力运动控制，主要原因是数据集缺乏运动风格多样性和自然语言难以表达定量特征。

Method: 使用零样本推理时优化方法，在采样步骤中更新预训练扩散模型的文本嵌入，引导运动生成模型具有所需的Laban Effort和Shape组件，无需额外运动数据。

Result: 该方法能够成功根据目标Laban标签操纵运动属性，产生多样化的表现力运动质量，同时保持运动身份。

Conclusion: 提出的方法实现了可解释和富有表现力的人体运动生成控制，通过Laban运动分析组件量化有效解决了细粒度运动控制难题。

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间智能（包括形状可视化、物体旋转、关系位置判断等）是多模态大语言模型尚未解决的关键挑战，需要开发有效的方法来提升模型的空间推理能力。

Method: 构建Euclid30K多模态数据集（约3万个几何问题），使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法微调Qwen2.5VL和RoboBrain2.0系列模型，使模型能够识别形状、计数、关联实体并运用欧几里得原理进行多步演绎推理。

Result: 经过Euclid30K训练后，所有评估模型在VSI-Bench上的平均准确率从34.5%提升到40.5%，提高了5.5个百分点。其中RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B达到49.6%的准确率，超越了之前的SOTA模型Spatial-MLLM。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究表明以几何为中心的微调可以为视觉语言模型赋予广泛可迁移的空间技能，几何问题求解是提升空间推理能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时尚产业是废物和排放的主要贡献者，促进二手市场发展很重要。机器学习方法在大规模评估二手服装价值方面发挥重要作用，但需要解决二手图像检索的可扩展性问题。

Method: 1. 使用聚类和核心集选择方法识别代表性样本；2. 引入基于邻域一致性得分的异常值去除方法，在筛选前过滤非典型样本；3. 在DeepFashion Attribute、DeepFashion Con2Shop和DeepFashion2三个数据集上评估。

Result: 检索系统在保持接近最优准确性的同时，通过减少添加到向量数据库的图像数量，显著降低了计算成本。异常值去除方法应用于聚类技术时，通过移除非判别性样本，获得了更高的检索性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过战略性修剪和选择代表性图像向量，在性能与效率之间实现了良好的权衡，为二手服装市场的可扩展图像检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在严重的视觉幻觉问题，即生成响应与视觉证据相矛盾。现有的直接偏好优化方法难以捕捉细粒度语义差异并容易导致捷径学习。

Method: SCPO框架包含：1)基于语义课程偏好对数据集的渐进式课程；2)动态参考模型；3)对称双向目标，同时学习文本和视觉偏好。

Result: 在LLaVA模型上的实验表明，SCPO在多个幻觉基准上表现优异，幻觉率降低高达62.9%，同时保持通用能力并在事实性方面有所提升。

Conclusion: SCPO是首个统一语义、对称性和课程学习的MLLM对齐框架，能有效缓解视觉幻觉问题，同时保持模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

Method: 提出EQUISeg框架，基于四阶段跨模态Transformer块(CMTB)实现多模态均衡编码，设计自引导模块(SGM)通过相互引导机制自适应调整模态贡献。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EQUISeg实现了显著的性能提升，有效缓解了分割任务中模态不平衡的不利影响。

Conclusion: EQUISeg通过均衡模态编码和自引导机制，成功解决了多模态分割中的模态不平衡问题，提升了模型在退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 标准CLIP文本编码器在复杂多对象场景中的图像编辑经常失败，无法有效处理对象数量和空间布局约束。

Method: QL-Adapter包含两个核心模块：ILFM将布局先验与CLIP图像编码器的ViT补丁标记融合以增强空间结构理解；CMAM将图像特征注入文本分支以丰富文本嵌入并改进指令跟随。

Result: 在QL-Edit任务上，QL-Adapter实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: QL-Adapter通过布局融合和跨模态增强有效解决了复杂场景中的多对象编辑问题，为数量一致和布局一致的图像编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Consistency Mid-Training (CMT)的新方法，通过在预训练和流映射训练之间插入轻量级中间阶段，解决了流映射模型训练不稳定、对超参数敏感和成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流映射模型（如一致性模型和均值流）虽然能够实现少步生成，但训练过程不稳定、对超参数敏感且成本高昂。即使从预训练扩散模型初始化，仍需要将无限小步转换为长跳映射，稳定性问题仍未解决。

Method: 提出了中间训练（mid-training）的概念和实际方法，具体实现为一致性中间训练（CMT）。这是一个紧凑且原则性的阶段，训练模型将预训练模型求解器轨迹上的点直接映射到求解器生成的干净样本，从而获得轨迹一致且稳定的初始化。

Result: CMT在多个数据集上取得了最先进的二步FID结果：CIFAR-10为1.97，ImageNet 64x64为1.32，ImageNet 512x512为1.84。相比一致性模型，使用了最多98%更少的训练数据和GPU时间。在ImageNet 256x256上，CMT达到一步FID 3.34，同时将总训练时间比从头训练的均值流减少约50%。

Conclusion: CMT被确立为一个原则性、高效且通用的流映射模型训练框架，能够实现快速、稳健的收敛而无需启发式方法。

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

Motivation: 现有方法使用原始掩码直接投影到3D空间，导致掩码碎片化和语义分配不准确，限制了在复杂环境中的有效性。

Method: 1. 使用SemanticSAM进行渐进式粒度细化生成更准确和更多的对象级掩码；2. 采用上下文感知的CLIP编码策略，整合多个上下文视图并使用经验确定的权重。

Conclusion: 该方法通过改进掩码生成和语义上下文编码，有效提升了3D场景理解的性能，为具身AI和机器人提供了更可靠的感知能力。

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次统一比较了Diffusion Bridge和Flow Matching两种模型，从随机最优控制和最优传输角度证明了Diffusion Bridge具有更低的成本函数和更稳定的轨迹，而Flow Matching在小数据量时插值系数效率下降。通过相同架构的实验验证了理论预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Diffusion Bridge和Flow Matching两种方法在任意分布转换中的优劣比较问题，由于它们在建模假设和实现上的显著差异，缺乏统一的理论解释和实验验证。

Method: 从随机最优控制角度重新构建两种框架，证明Diffusion Bridge的成本函数更低；从最优传输角度分析Flow Matching插值系数的效率问题。提出基于潜在Transformer的新Diffusion Bridge架构，并用相同结构实现Flow Matching进行公平比较。

Result: 在图像修复、超分辨率、去模糊、去噪、转换和风格迁移等任务上的综合实验表明，Diffusion Bridge在大多数情况下表现更优，特别是在数据量较少时优势更明显，实验结果与理论预测完全一致。

Conclusion: Diffusion Bridge总体上优于Flow Matching，特别是在小数据量场景下。研究为两种模型的应用选择提供了理论指导和实证依据。

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对雾天环境中人群计数面临的长距离目标模糊、局部特征退化和图像对比度衰减等关键挑战，需要开发能够适应复杂气象条件的鲁棒计数方法。

Method: 引入可微分大气散射模型，采用透射率动态估计和散射参数自适应校准技术；设计基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的MSA-KAN构建可学习边缘激活函数；提出天气感知GCN动态构建空间邻接矩阵。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，在浓雾场景下相比主流算法，MAE指标降低了12.2%-27.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理机制与数据驱动的协同优化，有效提升了雾天环境下人群计数的准确性，为解决复杂气象条件下的视觉任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSwap是一种针对大型视觉语言模型的隐蔽后门攻击方法，通过扰乱模型对物体关系的理解而非强制生成固定目标内容，实现了更高的隐蔽性和规避性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLM后门攻击使用固定目标模式，容易被检测到，因为模型会记忆这些频繁模式并表现出过度自信。需要更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 在训练时向选定样本注入视觉触发器，同时交换对应文本回答中关键标记的语法角色，使用自适应令牌加权损失来强调交换标记的学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试和各种LVLM架构上，TokenSwap实现了高攻击成功率，同时保持了优越的规避性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: TokenSwap通过关注LVLM的组合理解能力，提供了一种更隐蔽的后门攻击方法，突显了现有防御机制的局限性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种3D双向人脸-头骨可变形模型（BFSM），通过构建包含200多个样本的数据集和新的密集光线匹配配准方法，实现了人脸与头骨之间的双向形状推断，支持从单张图像进行3D重建和手术规划预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建联合的人脸-头骨可变形模型在远程诊断、手术规划等领域具有巨大潜力，但面临配对数据稀缺、配准精度不足、临床应用探索有限等挑战，特别是颅面畸形患者常被忽视导致代表性不足。

Method: 首先构建包含正常和罕见颅面状况的200多个样本数据集；提出密集光线匹配配准方法确保拓扑一致性；建立3D双向人脸-头骨可变形模型，通过共享系数空间实现形状双向推断，并建模组织厚度变化。

Result: 广泛的实验证实了方法的鲁棒性和准确性，BFSM能够从单张图像进行3D人脸-头骨重建，并支持手术规划预测。

Conclusion: BFSM模型成功解决了人脸-头骨建模中的关键挑战，为医疗应用提供了有效的工具，特别是在颅面畸形患者的代表性方面做出了贡献。

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了YOLOv11模型在血液细胞检测中的性能，创建了包含16,891张图像和298,850个标注细胞的大规模数据集，发现YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1数据分割下达到最佳平衡，mAP@0.5为0.934。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动外周血涂片分析劳动密集且主观，深度学习提供了有前景的替代方案，但缺乏对YOLOv11等先进模型在精细PBS检测中的系统评估。

Method: 创建大规模标注数据集，包含12种外周血细胞类别和红细胞类别；对5种YOLOv11变体在两种数据分割策略下进行综合评估，使用mAP、精确度、召回率、F1分数和计算效率等指标。

Result: YOLOv11 Medium变体在8:1:1分割下达到最佳性能平衡，mAP@0.5为0.934；更大模型仅带来边际精度提升但计算成本显著增加；8:1:1分割在所有模型中均优于7:2:1分割。

Conclusion: YOLOv11特别是Medium变体是自动化精细PBS检测的高效框架，公开发布的数据集为血液细胞检测研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动分析依赖手动标注或实验室设备，耗时昂贵且缺乏可扩展性。需要一种鲁棒的自动方法来提取相关动力学变量。

Method: 将结构化最优传输(SOT)概念应用于注意力时空图卷积网络(ASTGCN)，实现无监督的运动阶段分割。

Result: 在测试数据上达到71.02%的平均精度和74.61%的F1分数，显著优于现有无监督方法。发布了包含211个专业标枪投掷视频的新数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法为运动分析提供了一种高效的无监督解决方案，特别适用于需要精确时序分割的体育项目。

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

TL;DR: FreeRet是一个即插即用的框架，可将任何多模态大语言模型转换为两阶段检索器，无需额外训练就能实现强大的跨模态检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型需要大量后训练才能转换为检索编码器，这限制了它们的通用性和部署效率。

Method: 采用两阶段检索：首先从模型直接获取语义嵌入进行快速候选搜索，然后利用模型的推理能力进行精确重排序。

Result: 在MMEB和MMEB-V2基准测试的46个数据集上，FreeRet显著优于经过数百万对数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 预训练的多模态大语言模型经过精心利用后，无需训练即可作为强大的检索引擎，填补了其作为通用模型的关键空白。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPLICE是一个基于COIN教学视频数据集的人类策划基准，用于评估事件推理能力。该基准包含3,381个视频和11,423个事件片段，通过重排片段成连贯序列来测试视觉推理能力。结果显示VLMs与人类表现存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建SPLICE基准是为了探究事件推理的多个维度（时间、因果、空间、上下文和常识），并评估当前视觉语言模型在视觉推理方面的能力。

Method: 使用人类筛选的COIN教学视频数据集，将视频分割成事件片段，要求人类参与者和VLMs重排这些片段成连贯序列。同时测试了文本描述对性能的影响。

Result: VLMs表现显著低于人类。文本描述能提升模型准确率但不影响人类表现，表明模型更依赖语言先验而非视觉理解。VLMs在时间因果推理主导的视频上表现相对较好，在专业任务上表现较差。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在视觉推理方面仍面临挑战，特别是在上下文和空间推理主导的任务中。模型过度依赖语言先验而非真正的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 屏幕截图照片常受闪烁条纹影响，这种时间混叠现象严重影响可读性和感知质量，但相比莫尔条纹，闪烁条纹的研究相对不足。

Method: 使用基于扩散的框架，包含闪烁条纹先验估计器预测关键属性，并提出掩码损失专注于条纹区域监督。开发了模拟流水线生成训练数据，包含随机抖动的条纹角度、间距和宽度。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的定量指标和视觉比较显示，RIFLE在从轻微到严重闪烁条纹情况下均优于现有图像重建基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个研究闪烁条纹模拟和去除的工作，为后续研究在数据集构建和去除模型设计方面奠定了良好基础。

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

Motivation: 开放词汇伪装物体分割需要对训练期间未见类别的伪装物体进行分割，这对模型的泛化能力提出了极高要求。现有方法中的分类组件显著影响整体分割性能。

Method: 提出了一个分类器中心的自适应框架，通过轻量级文本适配器和新颖的分层非对称初始化来改进分类组件，从而增强分割性能。

Result: 在OVCamo基准测试中，相比OVCoser基线，cIoU从0.443提升到0.493，cSm从0.579提升到0.658，cMAE从0.336降低到0.239。

Conclusion: 有针对性的分类增强为提升伪装物体分割性能提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing
camouflaged object segmentation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中重度TBI病变在神经影像中具有极大的异质性（大小、数量、偏侧性各异），这给图像配准和脑区分割等下游任务带来困难，降低了分析准确性，因此需要开发高精度的TBI病变分割方法。

Conclusion: 开发的自动化分割管道能够有效检测和分割TBI病变，在AIMS-TBI 2025挑战赛中表现优异，其Python实现已公开可用。

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频生成模型计算成本高、生成速度慢的问题，实现低成本、高质量的视频生成。

Method: 采用线性注意力机制(Linear DiT)和恒定内存KV缓存技术，结合有效的数据过滤和模型训练策略。

Result: 训练成本仅为12天64 H100 GPU，是MovieGen的1%；相比同类模型快16倍，在RTX 5090上生成5秒720p视频从71秒加速到29秒。

Conclusion: SANA-Video实现了低成本、高质量的视频生成，在保持竞争力的同时显著提升了生成效率。

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的框架，通过显式推理物理不合理性来指导视频生成，提高物理逼真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型依赖大规模文本-视频数据集隐式学习物理推理，成本高、难以扩展且容易产生违反物理定律的不合理运动。

Method: 使用轻量级物理感知推理管道构建反事实提示，提出同步解耦引导策略，包括同步方向归一化和轨迹解耦去噪。

Result: 在不同物理领域的实验中，该方法显著提高了物理保真度，同时保持照片真实感，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的即插即用物理感知视频生成范式。

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注静态截图到代码的任务，忽略了真实网页应用中关键的动态交互特性。

Method: 构建包含113个任务的基准，涵盖100个真实网站，包含用户交互视频和静态资源，使用代理作为评判框架自动评估功能正确性和视觉保真度。

Result: 在28个大型视觉语言模型上的实验显示，最佳模型总体得分仅36.35%，功能正确性(24.39%)远低于视觉保真度(64.25%)。

Conclusion: 当前模型在推理时间动态性和合成事件驱动逻辑方面存在严重局限，IWR-Bench为视觉语言研究设立了具有挑战性的前沿。

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is
available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试为推动医学成像领域更鲁棒的视觉语言模型发展，特别是在低资源语言环境中的临床应用，迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

Motivation: 现有双模态跟踪方法在复杂场景中表现有限，主要原因是输入模态不足。为了解决这一差距，需要利用更多互补模态来提升跟踪性能。

Method: 提出了RDTTrack跟踪器，利用预训练的RGB跟踪模型和提示学习技术，通过正交投影约束融合热红外和深度模态，然后将其与RGB信号整合作为预训练基础跟踪模型的提示。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在复杂场景下的跟踪精度和鲁棒性方面相比现有双模态方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 三模态跟踪方法能够有效利用多种互补信息，在复杂场景中实现更鲁棒的目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

TL;DR: ExGS是一个新颖的前馈框架，通过统一通用高斯压缩(UGC)和GaussPainter实现极端3D高斯溅射压缩，能在100倍压缩下保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经场景表示如3D高斯溅射(3DGS)虽然能实现高质量神经渲染，但存储和传输成本高，限制了在资源受限环境中的部署。现有压缩方法要么优化成本高，要么在高压缩比下会降低渲染质量。

Method: ExGS框架包含两个核心组件：UGC进行无重优化剪枝，大幅减少高斯基元；GaussPainter利用扩散先验和掩码引导细化，从严重剪枝的高斯场景中恢复高质量渲染。采用轻量VAE和一步扩散设计实现实时恢复。

Result: 该框架能实现超过100倍的压缩（将典型的354.77 MB模型压缩到约3.31 MB），同时保持保真度，并在挑战性条件下显著改善图像质量。

Conclusion: 扩散先验在弥合极端压缩和高质量神经渲染之间的差距中发挥着核心作用。

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at
\href{https://github.com/chenttt2001/ExGS}{here}.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning
in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception
strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal

especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,
textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1

offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$

Method: 提出慢-快自适应帧采样机制：先提供低分辨率密集采样帧，模型可根据推理需要放大感兴趣片段获取高分辨率细节，整个过程实现为多步推理

Result: 在4个常见长视频理解基准测试中，LOVE-R1比基准模型Qwen2.5-VL平均提升3.1个百分点

Conclusion: 自适应缩放机制在采样密度和帧分辨率之间取得了良好平衡，有效解决了长视频理解中的时空权衡问题

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

TL;DR: 研究发现多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的视觉相关功能解码分布在不同解码层，每个视觉功能层（VFL）专注于特定功能（如计数、定位、OCR识别），且这些层的深度顺序在不同MLLMs中呈现一致性模式，与人类行为模式相符。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解MLLMs中视觉处理功能的分布机制，探索如何利用这种层特异性功能分布来优化模型训练和数据选择，提高模型效率和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出视觉令牌交换（Visual Token Swapping）分析框架，通过修改特定KV缓存条目来精确揭示解码过程中的层特异性功能；开发VFL-LoRA（选择性训练VFL层）和VFL-select（基于VFL消融的数据自动分类）方法。

Result: 发现VFL在MLLMs中呈现一致的功能分布模式；VFL-LoRA在性能上优于全LoRA训练，并能防止域外功能遗忘；VFL-select能自动按功能分类数据，仅使用20%数据即可达到98%的全数据性能，超越人类专家数据选择效果。

Conclusion: 该研究深化了对MLLM视觉处理机制的理解，为开发更高效、可解释和鲁棒的模型提供了理论基础和实践方法，展示了层特异性功能分布在模型优化中的重要作用。

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

TL;DR: Causal-Adapter是一个模块化框架，通过适配冻结的文本到图像扩散模型实现反事实图像生成，能够对目标属性进行因果干预并保持图像核心身份不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示工程而缺乏明确的因果结构，无法一致地将属性效果传播到因果依赖项。

Method: 利用结构因果建模，结合两种属性正则化策略：提示对齐注入和条件令牌对比损失，以解耦属性因子并减少虚假相关性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能，Pendulum数据集MAE减少91%，ADNI数据集FID减少87%。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了鲁棒、可泛化的反事实编辑，具有忠实的属性修改和强大的身份保持能力。

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合拓扑数据分析和图像过滤技术的3D物体分类方法TACO-Net，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能，并表现出对噪声输入的良好鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D物体分类在计算机视觉、机器人和自动驾驶等领域具有重要应用价值，但由于点云的无序性、不规则性和噪声问题，实现高精度分类仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 将点云转换为体素化二值3D图像，提取区分性拓扑特征，然后使用轻量级一维卷积神经网络进行训练。

Result: 在ModelNet40和ModelNet10数据集上分别达到99.05%和99.52%的准确率，在真实世界OmniObject3D数据集上表现稳健，对10种不同类型的损坏输入具有强韧性。

Conclusion: TACO-Net通过结合拓扑特征和深度学习，在3D物体分类任务中实现了最先进的性能，并展示了良好的鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

*Zeyu Cai,Ziyang Li,Xiaoben Li,Boqian Li,Zeyu Wang,Zhenyu Zhang,Yuliang Xiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UP2You是首个无需调参的解决方案，能够从极其不受约束的野外2D照片中重建高保真3D穿衣人像，支持任意姿态控制和免训练的多服装3D虚拟试穿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要"干净"输入（如全身图像、最小遮挡或良好校准的跨视角捕捉）的限制，直接处理原始、非结构化的照片，这些照片在姿态、视角、裁剪和遮挡方面可能有显著差异。

Method: 引入数据校正器范式，在单次前向传播中高效地将不受约束的输入转换为干净的正交多视角图像；核心是姿态相关特征聚合模块（PCFA），选择性融合多参考图像信息；以及基于感知器的多参考形状预测器，无需预捕捉身体模板。

Result: 在4D-Dress、PuzzleIOI和野外捕捉数据上的广泛实验表明，UP2You在几何精度（Chamfer-15%、P2S-18%）和纹理保真度（PSNR-21%、LPIPS-46%）方面均优于先前方法，效率高（1.5分钟每人）。

Conclusion: UP2You高效、多功能，适用于人类被随意捕捉的真实世界场景，为这一未充分探索的任务的未来研究提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为\ours的训练无关视觉token剪枝框架，通过零阶扰动估计token敏感性，选择高敏感性且互补的视觉token，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉token剪枝方法存在局限性：基于注意力的方法依赖不稳定的注意力分数，导致冗余选择；基于多样性的方法可能丢弃对准确预测重要的区域。

Method: 在投影层使用零阶扰动估计token敏感性，通过轻量级前向传播测量小随机扰动对投影输出的影响，无需反向传播即可近似每个token的影响力。

Result: 在多个VLM和基准测试中，\ours始终优于现有方法，可剪枝高达94.4%的token同时保持准确性，端到端推理速度提升高达2.30倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过token敏感性估计和互补性选择，实现了高效且准确的视觉token剪枝，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有rPPG方法在头部运动和光照变化下精度下降，且大多缺乏理论依据，限制了鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: 从血流动力学Navier-Stokes方程推导出脉搏信号遵循二阶动力系统，设计PHASE-Net包含三个关键组件：零FLOP轴向交换器、自适应空间滤波器和门控TCN。

Result: PHASE-Net在广泛实验中实现了最先进的性能，具有强效率和部署就绪性。

Conclusion: PHASE-Net提供了一个理论上有依据且实用的rPPG解决方案，结合了物理原理和深度学习优势。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ELPG-DTFS是一种基于脑电图（EEG）的抑郁症诊断方法，通过引入通道-频带注意力、可学习邻接矩阵和残差知识图谱路径，显著提升了诊断准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抑郁症诊断主要依赖主观量表，而脑电图虽然提供低成本生物标志物，但现有深度模型将频谱视为静态图像，固定通道间图结构，忽略先验知识，限制了准确性和可解释性。

Method: 提出ELPG-DTFS方法，包含：(1) 基于跨频带互信息的通道-频带注意力机制；(2) 动态功能连接的可学习邻接矩阵；(3) 注入神经科学先验的残差知识图谱路径。

Result: 在128通道MODMA数据集（53名受试者）上，ELPG-DTFS达到97.63%准确率和97.33% F1分数，超越2025年最先进的ACM-GNN。消融实验显示移除任何模块都会使F1下降高达4.35。

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS为基于脑电图的下一代抑郁症诊断提供了一个稳健且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static
images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy
and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting
neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS
achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art
ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35,
confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and
interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

Motivation: 受人类视觉系统的对比度增强和颜色对立机制启发，旨在开发一种模型无关的预处理方法，在不改变模型架构或训练的情况下提升语义分割在恶劣环境下的鲁棒性。

Method: 在RGB、灰度和对立颜色通道上应用高斯差分滤波进行输入预处理，增强局部对比度，这种方法轻量且与模型无关。

Result: 在Cityscapes、ACDC和Dark Zurich数据集上的评估表明，该方法在保持正常条件下性能的同时，显著提高了在夜间、雾天和雪天等恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种生物启发的预处理方法具有模型无关性和轻量级特性，有潜力集成到成像管道中，为安全关键环境中的下游视觉模型提供任务就绪的鲁棒输入。

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在实时流媒体场景中因历史视觉特征存储限制和实时时空推理不足而效果有限的问题。

Method: 提出持久事件记忆森林机制，基于时间距离、内容相似度和合并频率的惩罚函数自适应组织视频帧为事件级树结构；引入细粒度时空窗口捕获详细短期视觉线索；创建OnlineIT指令调优数据集。

Result: 在StreamingBench上达到77.3%准确率，OVBench上60.5%，OVO-Bench上55.6%；在极端视觉令牌压缩（1024令牌）下仍保持96.8%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: StreamForest在流媒体视频理解中展现出强大的鲁棒性、效率和泛化能力，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在遥感领域应用时面临环境上下文有限、处理缺失或损坏数据能力不足、难以可靠反映用户意图等问题，需要开发更强大的条件生成方法。

Conclusion: 环境上下文条件控制能够提升卫星图像基础模型的性能，该模型在下游任务中具有应用潜力，同时构建了首个公开的包含三种模态数据的多模态数据集。

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

Motivation: 公共数据集中严重的类别不平衡抑制了稀有类别的识别性能，这影响了智能交通和物流系统的准确性。

Method: 整合Kaggle、ImageNet和网络爬取数据创建16类语料库，使用SMOTE过采样和针对性欠采样生成6个平衡变体。比较了基于MobileNet-V2特征的轻量级集成方法（随机森林、AdaBoost、软投票组合器）与可配置ResNet风格CNN的性能。

Conclusion: 深度模型具有优势，但仅靠重平衡方法有限。建议优先收集更多少数类别数据、使用成本敏感目标（如焦点损失），并探索混合集成或CNN管道以结合可解释性和表示能力。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure
mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest
prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives
(e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine
interpretability with representational power.

Result: 在MR-ART、FastMRI和MyConnectome基准测试中达到最先进性能，具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过桥接定量分析和语义推理，生成临床可解释的输出，增强动态医疗环境中的质量控制。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VagueGAN是一种针对生成模型的攻击方法，通过在输入中植入隐蔽扰动来操控生成图像的输出，这种攻击在潜空间进行，可能提升图像质量而非降低保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注判别模型的对抗攻击，而针对生成模型管道的攻击研究较少，特别是那些能够通过微小扰动实现输出可控变化的攻击方法。

Method: 结合模块化扰动网络PoisonerNet与生成器-判别器对，构建隐蔽触发器，通过潜空间中毒而非像素级扰动来操控生成过程。

Result: 中毒输出可能比干净输出具有更高的视觉质量，挑战了中毒必然降低保真度的假设；攻击在ControlNet引导的现代扩散模型中具有可转移性。

Conclusion: 潜空间中毒攻击暴露了像素级防御的盲点，精心优化的扰动可以在保持视觉隐蔽性的同时对生成器输出产生一致影响，对图像生成管道的完整性构成威胁。

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

*Yu Ma,Guoliang Wei,Yue Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DWGS是一个增强3D高斯溅射用于稀疏视图合成的统一框架，通过整合结构线索、虚拟视图约束和遮挡区域补全来解决稀疏输入下的伪影和结构不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图下的新视角合成存在过拟合、几何失真和场景恢复不完整的问题，3D高斯溅射在稀疏输入下会产生漂浮伪影和结构不一致。

Method: 提出混合损失深度估计模块、双向扭曲虚拟视图合成方法和遮挡感知重建组件，分别用于增强多视图一致性、施加几何和光度约束以及恢复遮挡区域。

Result: 在LLFF、Blender和DTU基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，PSNR达21.13 dB，LPIPS为0.189，同时保持实时推理能力。

Conclusion: DWGS通过整合结构线索、虚拟视图约束和遮挡补全，显著提升了稀疏视图下3D高斯溅射的性能，在多个基准测试中取得最优结果。

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DAM框架，通过整合视觉语言模型的监督信号与稀疏人工标注，在源自由主动域适应中实现双向知识蒸馏，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉语言模型和数据监督视为独立来源，缺乏有效融合，限制了源自由主动域适应的效果。

Method: DAM框架整合多模态监督，初始化稳定的ViL引导目标，采用双向蒸馏机制在迭代适应过程中促进目标模型与双重监督之间的知识交换。

Result: 在多个SFADA基准测试和主动学习策略中，DAM始终优于现有方法，创造了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过有效融合多模态监督与稀疏人工标注，DAM框架在源自由主动域适应中实现了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的青少年特发性脊柱侧弯评估框架，通过预测椎体终板角度和坐标来保留椎体楔形变解剖特征，无需预设曲线模式即可灵活检测各种脊柱侧弯模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动测量Cobb角存在显著观察者变异性，现有自动化方法使用简化的脊柱模型和预设曲线模式，无法应对临床复杂性。

Method: 结合HRNet主干网络和Swin-Transformer模块，采用生物力学约束增强特征提取，使用奇异值分解直接从椎体形态分析角度预测，无需预设曲线假设。

Result: 在630张全脊柱前后位X光片上达到83.45%诊断准确率和2.55°平均绝对误差，在分布外病例上表现出优异泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的椎体楔形指数与曲线进展有显著预后相关性，而传统Cobb角无相关性，为早期检测、个性化治疗和进展监测提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

*Mohsen Ghafoorian,Denis Korzhenkov,Amirhossein Habibian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Attention Surgery是一种无需从头训练即可将预训练视频扩散模型中的注意力机制线性化或混合化的高效框架，在保持生成质量的同时将注意力计算成本降低高达40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视频扩散模型虽然生成质量优秀，但自注意力机制的二次计算成本限制了长序列和高分辨率视频的生成效率。现有线性注意力方法无法在不进行昂贵重新训练的情况下达到softmax注意力的表达能力。

Method: 结合了新型混合注意力机制（混合softmax和线性token）与轻量级蒸馏和微调流程，仅需少量GPU天训练。还采用了成本感知的块率策略来平衡各层的表达能力和效率。

Result: 在Wan2.1 1.3B模型上应用Attention Surgery，实现了首个具有竞争力的次二次注意力视频扩散模型，在标准VBench和VBench-2.0基准测试中保持生成质量的同时，注意力计算FLOPs减少高达40%。

Conclusion: Attention Surgery框架成功地将预训练视频扩散模型的注意力机制高效线性化，在显著降低计算成本的同时保持了生成质量，为长序列和高分辨率视频生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在系统结构和挑战性场景方面存在不足，限制了统一多模态模型在图像生成和编辑任务上的性能。

Method: 采用分层任务分类与自动化数据生成相结合的方法，利用结构化资源池和GPT-4o构建包含基础能力和高实用性挑战类别的数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升，编辑任务性能提升达18%（UniWorld-V1在ImgEdit-Bench），生成任务提升13%（Harmon在GenEval）。

Conclusion: 系统化的数据构建是推进多模态AI能力的关键。

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出SID方法，通过自我改进演示增强目标导向的语言引导导航，在未知环境中实现更强大的探索能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖最短路径轨迹，缺乏有效的探索先验来训练导航智能体，限制了在未知环境中的导航性能

Method: SID方法首先在环境采样的最短路径数据上训练初始智能体，然后利用该智能体生成新颖的探索轨迹，通过迭代自我改进流程提升智能体性能

Result: SID显著提升了导航智能体的探索能力和泛化性，在REVERIE和SOON任务上达到最先进性能，在SOON未见验证集上达到50.9%成功率，比之前领先方法高出13.9%

Conclusion: 自我改进演示方法能够有效提升目标导向语言导航的性能，该框架可扩展到新环境，产生的演示可跨任务转移

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

TL;DR: 提出Seg-CFT方法，通过结构分割器引导生成局部一致的医学图像反事实，避免传统方法在结构特异性干预时产生的全局不良影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实图像生成方法依赖外部分类器进行主体级干预，但在结构特异性干预（如改变左肺区域）时效果不足，会产生不理想的全局影响，且需要繁琐的像素级标签图作为指导。

Method: Seg-CFT方法使用结构分割器进行引导，保持对标量值结构特定变量干预的简单性，同时生成局部一致且有效的反事实图像。

Result: 成功生成逼真的胸部X光片，并在冠状动脉疾病建模方面显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: Seg-CFT方法能够有效生成局部一致的反事实医学图像，为数据增强、去偏和疾病建模提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

TL;DR: 本文研究了GAN的可扩展性，通过在VAE潜空间训练和使用纯transformer架构，解决了GAN规模扩展时的失败模式，提出了轻量级中间监督和宽度感知学习率调整方法，在ImageNet-256上实现了2.96 FID的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成对抗网络（GANs）的可扩展性，虽然可扩展性推动了生成模型的进展，但在对抗学习中的原则仍未充分探索。

Method: 在紧凑的变分自编码器潜空间中训练，采用纯transformer生成器和判别器，通过轻量级中间监督和宽度感知学习率调整解决规模扩展问题。

Result: GAT-XL/2在ImageNet-256上实现了2.96 FID的SOTA单步类条件生成性能，仅需40个epoch，比强基线少6倍训练轮次。

Conclusion: 纯transformer和潜空间GANs可以在广泛容量范围内可靠训练，通过适当的设计选择可以实现GAN的有效扩展。

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频具有时间复杂性和任务相关信息稀疏的特点，现有基于大语言模型的方法在捕捉任务关键信息时难以兼顾完整性和效率。

Method: 提出CogniGPT框架，包含多粒度感知代理（MGPA）模拟人类视觉注意机制，以及验证增强反思代理（VERA）验证关键线索并优化感知策略，通过交互循环探索最小化的可靠任务相关线索集。

Result: 在EgoSchema、Video-MME、NExT-QA和MovieChat数据集上的实验表明，CogniGPT在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。在EgoSchema上仅使用11.2帧就超越了现有无训练方法，性能可与Gemini 1.5-Pro相媲美。

Conclusion: CogniGPT通过模拟人类渐进式视觉认知的交互机制，实现了长视频理解中准确性与效率的良好平衡，为处理复杂长视频任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

Motivation: 深度学习在医学影像等高风险领域需要精确的置信度估计，过度自信的错误分类可能带来严重后果。

Method: 构建自定义CNN模型，在合并的脑MRI数据集上训练，引入五种图像噪声模拟真实世界不确定性，使用TS进行后处理校准。

Result: TS在所有噪声条件下都能显著降低ECE和NLL，同时不降低分类准确率。

Conclusion: TS是增强医学AI系统决策置信度的有效且计算高效的方法，使模型输出在噪声或不确定环境中更可靠。

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法大多忽略场景中的人类，且缺乏标注的人-环境关系数据，同时现有方法通常只能从单帧图像中捕捉开放词汇关系，限制了其对超出观察内容的长期交互建模能力。

Method: 引入Social 3D Scene Graphs表示，使用开放词汇框架捕捉人类、属性、活动及环境关系；创建包含合成环境和全面人-场景关系注释的新基准。

Result: 实验表明，该表示方法改进了人类活动预测和人与环境关系的推理能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为社交智能机器人的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在低光和快速运动条件下具有优势，但现有RGB方法在事件数据上表现不佳，且事件数据空间信息有限，缺乏标注数据集阻碍了该领域发展。

Method: 使用跨模态融合注意力(CMFA)整合RGB数据指导事件输入的特征提取，同时采用自监督多事件表示学习(SSMER)从无标签事件数据中学习有效特征。

Result: 在真实事件E-SIE数据集和合成的WFLW-V基准测试上，该方法在多个评估指标上持续超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的CMFA和SSMER框架有效解决了事件数据面部关键点对齐的挑战，通过跨模态融合和自监督学习提升了性能。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 该方法在BraTS灯塔挑战赛2025任务1-成人胶质瘤分割中排名第一，证明了在线数据增强策略的有效性。

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This

Result: 模型在视觉质量、运动真实性和透明度渲染方面表现出色，能够生成各种半透明物体、发光效果和头发丝等精细细节。

Conclusion: Wan-Alpha框架在RGBA视频生成任务上取得了显著进展，为透明视频生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new
framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha
channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as
hair strands. The released model is available on our website:

### [324] [SDPose: Exploiting Diffusion Priors for Out-of-Domain and Robust Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24980)
*Shuang Liang,Jing He,Chuanmeizhi Wang,Lejun Liao,Guo Zhang,Yingcong Chen,Yuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDPose是一个基于Stable Diffusion的微调框架，用于人体姿态估计，通过直接在SD U-Net的潜在空间中预测关键点热图来充分利用预训练扩散先验，在少量训练下达到与Sapiens相当的性能，并在跨域基准上创下新纪录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型提供了丰富的多尺度潜在特征，但它们在结构化输出（如人体姿态估计）方面的潜力尚未充分探索。现有方法如Marigold和Lotus主要关注密集预测，而SDPose旨在充分利用扩散先验进行人体姿态估计。

Method: 1. 直接在SD U-Net的图像潜在空间中预测关键点热图，保留原始生成先验；2. 通过轻量级卷积姿态头将潜在特征映射到关键点热图；3. 加入辅助RGB重建分支以防止过拟合并增强跨域鲁棒性。

Result: 仅使用Sapiens在COCO上训练计划的五分之一，SDPose在COCO验证集上达到与Sapiens-1B/2B相当的性能，在跨域基准HumanArt和COCO-OOD上创下新纪录。还能作为零样本姿态标注器用于下游可控生成任务。

Conclusion: SDPose展示了预训练扩散模型作为视觉骨干在结构化预测任务中的强大潜力，通过保留生成先验实现了优异的跨域泛化能力，并为下游生成任务提供了高质量的姿态指导。

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoWorld-X是一个用于高保真可控全景视频生成的新框架，支持多样化相机轨迹，通过球面感知扩散变换器架构解决全景数据几何对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于窄视场限制或相机可控性不足，无法生成连续完整的360度视觉世界，限制了用户或自主代理的自由探索。

Method: 首先通过Unreal Engine在虚拟3D环境中模拟相机轨迹构建大规模全景视频-探索路径数据集；然后提出球面感知扩散变换器架构，将等距柱面特征重新投影到球面上以建模几何邻接关系。

Result: 大量实验表明PanoWorld-X在运动范围、控制精度和视觉质量等方面均取得优越性能。

Conclusion: 该框架在真实世界应用中具有巨大潜力，能够生成高质量的可控全景视频。

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Local View Transformer (LVT)，一种用于大规模场景重建和新视角合成的高效架构，避免了标准Transformer的二次复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer在3D视觉和新视角合成中表现出色，但其二次复杂度限制了在大规模场景中的应用。

Method: 利用局部邻域视图处理信息，采用基于相对几何变换的新型位置编码，并将输出解码为包含颜色和透明度视图依赖的3D高斯泼溅场景表示。

Result: LVT能够在单次前向传播中重建任意大规模、高分辨率场景。

Conclusion: Local View Transformer通过局部注意力机制有效解决了大规模场景重建的计算复杂度问题。

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

Motivation: 为大型未标注数据集（如数字广告和营销工作流中的品牌安全筛选、创意资产管理和社交媒体内容审核）提供易于复现的强基线方法，避免手动调参和训练需求。

Method: 使用自监督ViT编码器（DINO）提取补丁特征，构建亲和矩阵并应用谱聚类，通过特征间隙轮廓搜索自动选择分割数量，使用全连接DenseCRF锐化边界。

Result: 在COCO Stuff和ADE20K数据集上获得了竞争性的mIoU和像素精度，与最近的无监督基线方法表现相当。

Conclusion: CLASP的零训练设计使其成为处理大型未标注语料库的强大且易于复现的基线方法，特别适用于数字广告和营销工作流中的各种应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such
as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content
moderation

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have delivered strong
reasoning capabilities in natural image domains, yet their potential for Earth
Observation (EO) remains largely unexplored. EO tasks introduce unique
challenges, spanning referred object detection, image or region captioning,

TL;DR: 提出了STAGE框架，通过优势/KL重加权和熵奖励来解决GRPO在自回归图像生成中的训练不稳定问题，提升图像质量和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO算法应用于自回归图像模型时存在训练不稳定问题，容易破坏预训练模型能力，导致图像质量下降和泛化能力差

Method: 1. 优势/KL重加权：基于相似度的重加权缓解冲突更新；2. 熵奖励：基于参考模型的熵奖励稳定学习过程

Result: 在多个基准测试中，STAGE相比基线GRPO持续提升了视觉质量、稳定性和跨任务泛化能力

Conclusion: STAGE通过缓解token间冲突和稳定训练，减少了预训练分布的破坏，缓解了奖励破解问题，从而改善了泛化能力

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出VT-FSL框架，通过LLM构建精确的跨模态提示，结合几何感知对齐来解决少样本学习中的语义幻觉问题，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本学习中由于缺乏实际实例基础而产生的语义幻觉问题，避免噪声引导和昂贵的修正成本。

Method: 提出跨模态迭代提示(CIP)和跨模态几何对齐(CGA)。CIP基于LLM和支撑图像迭代生成精确类别描述，并零样本合成语义一致的图像；CGA通过最小化三维平行多面体的核化体积来对齐文本、支撑和合成视觉表示。

Result: 在十个不同的基准测试中（包括标准、跨域和细粒度少样本学习场景）建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: VT-FSL框架通过精确的跨模态提示和几何感知对齐，有效解决了少样本学习中的语义幻觉问题，实现了结构化且一致的多模态集成。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available
at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

representations (coordinate- and angle-based) are presented for the pipeline.
In addition, an efficient method to improve robustness against camera angle
variations is also introduced by using artificially rotated training data.
Experiments on a custom traffic-control gesture dataset demonstrate high
accuracy across varying viewing angles and speeds. Finally, an approach to
calculate the speed of the arm signal (if necessary) is also presented.

Conclusion: FFDP框架在性能和效率上都优于现有SOTA图像配准方法，能够处理前所未有的规模问题。

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜数据集规模巨大（通常超过10万张粒子图像），传统傅里叶空间方法效率高但保真度低，而基于神经辐射场的实空间方法精度高但内存和计算开销呈立方增长。

Method: GEM使用紧凑的3D高斯表示蛋白质（每个高斯仅需11个参数），并设计了新颖的梯度计算方法，显著减少了内存占用和训练成本。

Result: 在标准冷冻电镜基准测试中，GEM实现了比最先进方法快48%的训练速度、低12%的内存使用，局部分辨率提升高达38.8%。

Conclusion: GEM为冷冻电镜重建提供了一个实用且可扩展的范式，统一了速度、效率和高分辨率精度。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust
training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE
to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in
complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth

TL;DR: MANI-Pure是一个基于扩散模型的对抗净化框架，通过分析对抗扰动的频率分布特性，自适应地注入异质性噪声来有效抑制高频脆弱区域的扰动，同时保护低频语义内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法使用均匀噪声注入，会破坏语义结构并削弱鲁棒性。研究发现对抗扰动并非均匀分布，而是主要集中在高频区域，且在不同频率和攻击类型中呈现异质性强度模式。

Method: 提出MANI-Pure框架，利用输入的幅度谱来指导净化过程。自适应地应用异质性、频率目标噪声，有效抑制脆弱高频、低幅度频段的对抗扰动，同时保留语义关键的低频内容。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验验证了有效性。将干净准确率差距缩小到原始分类器的0.59以内，同时将鲁棒准确率提升2.15，在RobustBench排行榜上达到top-1鲁棒准确率，超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MANI-Pure通过频率自适应的噪声注入策略，显著提升了对抗净化的效果，在保持干净准确率的同时大幅提升鲁棒性，成为新的最先进方法。

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque

### [337] [Score Distillation of Flow Matching Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25127)
*Mingyuan Zhou,Yi Gu,Huangjie Zheng,Liangchen Song,Guande He,Yizhe Zhang,Wenze Hu,Yinfei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文证明了分数蒸馏技术可以直接应用于文本到图像的流匹配模型，通过简单的贝叶斯规则推导统一了高斯扩散和流匹配方法，无需依赖ODE/SDE公式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但采样过程缓慢。蒸馏方法可以加速生成过程，但之前不清楚蒸馏技术是否适用于流匹配模型，因为流匹配与扩散在理论上等价但实现方式不同。

Method: 基于贝叶斯规则和条件期望的简单推导，统一高斯扩散和流匹配框架。将分数身份蒸馏(SiD)扩展到预训练的文本到图像流匹配模型，包括SANA、SD3-Medium、SD3.5-Medium/Large和FLUX.1-dev等DiT骨干模型。

Result: 实验表明，只需对流匹配和DiT进行适度调整，SiD就能在这些模型上直接工作，在无数据和有数据辅助的设置中都能有效加速，无需教师模型微调或架构更改。

Conclusion: 这首次系统证明了分数蒸馏技术广泛适用于文本到图像流匹配模型，解决了之前关于稳定性和合理性的担忧，统一了扩散和流匹配生成器的加速技术。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

*Junyi Zhang,Jia-Chen Gu,Wenbo Hu,Yu Zhou,Robinson Piramuthu,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于分析患者在不同就诊期间病情变化的时间医学图像基准TemMed-Bench，评估大视觉语言模型在时序医学图像上的推理能力，发现大多数模型缺乏分析病情变化的能力，并探索了多模态检索增强的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学推理基准主要关注单次就诊的图像分析，偏离了真实临床实践中医生参考患者历史病情进行综合评估的现实需求。

Method: 构建包含三个任务（视觉问答、报告生成、图像对选择）的测试集和超过17,000个实例的知识库，评估12个大视觉语言模型，并探索多模态检索增强方法。

Result: 大多数LVLMs缺乏分析时序医学图像中病情变化的能力，在闭卷设置下表现接近随机猜测水平。GPT o3、o4-mini和Claude 3.5 Sonnet表现相对较好但仍有差距。多模态检索增强相比无检索和纯文本检索带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了LVLMs在时序医学图像推理方面的局限性，并表明多模态检索增强是解决这一挑战的有前景方向。

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

*Zhaozhi Wang,Tong Zhang,Mingyue Guo,Yaowei Wang,Qixiang Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoAnchor是一个即插即用的模块，利用子空间亲和性来增强跨帧的视觉线索，无需重新训练，有效将注意力锚定到共享的视觉结构上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言对齐方面取得了显著进展，但在视觉空间推理方面仍然有限。这种限制源于注意力机制：视觉标记被语言标记所掩盖，阻止模型跨帧一致地识别相同的视觉线索。

Method: 将稀疏子空间聚类中的自表达特性与Transformer中的注意力机制联系起来，提出VideoAnchor模块，利用子空间亲和性来强化跨帧的视觉线索。

Result: 在基准测试和骨干模型上的广泛实验显示了一致的性能提升——例如，在InternVL2-8B和Qwen2.5VL-72B上，VSI-Bench和Video-MME（空间相关任务）分别提升了3.2%和4.6%。

Conclusion: VideoAnchor通过子空间亲和性有效增强了多模态大语言模型的视觉空间推理能力，定性分析显示更一致的子空间划分和更强的视觉基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

TL;DR: GSM8K-V是一个纯视觉多图像数学推理基准，通过将文本数学问题转化为视觉形式来评估视觉语言模型的数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉数学推理基准主要局限于几何问题，缺乏数学文字问题的覆盖，且很少评估跨多图像的推理能力。

Method: 通过精心设计的自动化图像生成流程和人工标注，将文本基准GSM8K中的样本系统性地映射为视觉形式，构建了1,319个高质量样本。

Result: 评估显示，现有模型在文本GSM8K上接近饱和（最佳模型95.22%），但在GSM8K-V上表现显著下降（最佳模型仅46.93%）。

Conclusion: GSM8K-V为视觉数学推理提供了新视角，建立了指导开发更鲁棒和泛化性更强的视觉语言模型的基准。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出Rolling Forcing技术，通过联合去噪、注意力汇聚和高效训练算法，解决流式视频生成中的误差累积问题，实现实时生成长视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式视频生成方法存在严重的误差累积问题，导致长时生成视频质量显著下降，需要解决这一关键挑战。

Method: 1. 联合去噪方案：同时处理多帧，缓解严格因果关系；2. 注意力汇聚机制：保留初始帧作为全局上下文锚点；3. 高效训练算法：在扩展去噪窗口上进行少步蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明Rolling Forcing能在单GPU上实时生成多分钟视频，显著减少误差累积。

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing技术有效解决了流式视频生成中的误差累积问题，实现了高质量、低延迟的长视频流生成。

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种将预训练视觉编码器对齐为潜在扩散模型图像标记器的方法，通过三阶段对齐策略建立语义丰富的潜在空间，加速扩散模型收敛并提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统从头训练VAE主要关注低层细节，而预训练基础编码器具有丰富的语义结构，希望利用这些语义信息来改进图像生成。

Method: 三阶段对齐策略：1) 冻结编码器训练适配器和解码器建立语义潜在空间；2) 联合优化所有组件并添加语义保持损失；3) 精炼解码器提升重建质量。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上，标记器加速扩散模型收敛，64轮达到gFID 1.90；在LAION上，20亿参数文本到图像模型在相同训练步数下持续优于FLUX VAE。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，为连续标记器设计建立了语义基础范式，能有效提升扩散模型的生成性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

TL;DR: PICO是一个基于扩散变换器的视觉上下文学习框架，通过四面板设计实现个性化视觉任务，无需重新训练即可从单个标注示例中推断并应用变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模型在预定义任务上表现良好，但在个性化视觉任务（用户自定义对象或新目标）上表现不佳。现有方法依赖昂贵的微调或合成数据管道，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出PICO框架，利用扩散变换器作为视觉上下文学习器，构建VisRel多样化调优数据集，并引入注意力引导的种子评分器来提高推理可靠性。

Result: PICO在实验中超越了微调和合成数据基线方法，能够灵活适应新颖的用户定义任务，并在识别和生成任务上都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 任务多样性而非规模驱动鲁棒泛化，PICO为个性化视觉任务提供了一种无需重新训练的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型经常产生与输入图像内容不一致的幻觉输出，特别是浅层视觉特征更容易导致幻觉，因为它们只捕获有偏见的低层信息。

Method: LayerCD通过对比视觉编码器浅层和深层特征生成的输出分布来过滤幻觉，利用深层特征提供的高层推理能力。

Result: 在两个幻觉基准测试上的实验表明，LayerCD显著优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: LayerCD是一种简单有效的减少多模态大语言模型幻觉的方法，通过层次对比解码机制提升了模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at
https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .

TL;DR: GHOST是一种自动生成诱导多模态大语言模型产生物体幻觉图像的方法，通过优化图像嵌入空间来误导模型，成功率超过28%，远高于之前的1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，即模型会感知图像中不存在的物体。现有基准测试使用固定视觉场景，无法发现模型特定或未预见的幻觉漏洞。

Method: GHOST在图像嵌入空间进行优化，误导模型同时保持目标对象缺失，然后引导扩散模型生成自然图像。生成的图像保持视觉自然性，但包含微妙误导线索。

Result: 在包括GLM-4.1V-Thinking在内的多个模型上，幻觉成功率超过28%。为Qwen2.5-VL优化的图像在GPT-4o上诱导幻觉率达66.5%。生成的图像质量高且无目标对象。

Conclusion: GHOST既是诊断工具也是纠正工具，通过在其生成的图像上进行微调可以减轻幻觉问题，有助于构建更可靠的多模态系统。

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

TL;DR: DC-Gen是一个通过深度压缩潜在空间来加速文本到图像扩散模型的通用框架，显著提升高分辨率图像生成效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在高分辨率（如4K）生成时面临效率挑战，而现有研究很少处理潜在空间中的固有冗余

Method: 采用后训练管道，首先通过轻量级嵌入对齐训练弥合表示差距，然后进行少量LoRA微调来保持基础模型质量

Result: DC-Gen-FLUX在NVIDIA H100 GPU上实现4K图像生成延迟减少53倍，结合NVFP4 SVDQuant后总延迟减少138倍

Conclusion: DC-Gen能够在不牺牲生成质量的前提下，显著加速文本到图像扩散模型的高分辨率生成

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video
diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression

innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained
Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100
GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than

Method: 通过训练个性化的对象中心位姿估计器，利用预训练的图像到3D模型进行监督，指导可变形3D高斯表示的优化，并结合长期2D点跟踪进行正则化。

Result: PAD3R能够以类别无关的方式重建高保真、可关节化的3D表示，在具有挑战性的场景中表现出良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态场景理解和3D内容创建方面具有重要潜力，结合生成先验和可微分渲染实现了高质量的可变形3D重建。

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

TL;DR: PixelCraft是一个用于结构化图像处理的多智能体系统，通过高保真图像处理和灵活视觉推理，显著提升多模态大语言模型在图表和几何图像任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉线索的方法在处理结构化图像时受到低保真图像处理和线性推理模式的限制，导致感知错误会级联传播到错误结论。

Method: 构建包含调度器、规划器、推理器、批评器和视觉工具智能体的多智能体系统，通过动态三阶段工作流程（工具选择、智能体讨论、自我批评）和图像记忆机制实现灵活推理。

Result: 在具有挑战性的图表和几何基准测试中，PixelCraft显著提升了先进MLLMs的视觉推理性能，为结构化图像推理设立了新标准。

Conclusion: PixelCraft通过高保真图像处理和灵活的多智能体推理框架，有效解决了结构化图像推理中的关键挑战，为复杂视觉任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

TL;DR: FlashI2V是一种新的图像到视频生成方法，通过潜在偏移和傅里叶引导来解决条件图像泄漏问题，在域外数据上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有I2V方法存在条件图像泄漏问题，导致运动缓慢、颜色不一致，并在域外场景中性能下降。

Method: 使用潜在偏移技术修改流匹配的源分布和目标分布，通过傅里叶变换获取高频特征来加速收敛和调整细节水平。

Result: 在Vbench-I2V上获得53.01的动态度分数，仅用1.3B参数就超越了CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V和Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P。

Conclusion: FlashI2V有效克服了条件图像泄漏问题，在域外数据上实现了最佳泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

TL;DR: Visual Jigsaw是一个自监督的后训练框架，通过视觉拼图任务增强多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力，无需额外视觉生成组件或标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的后训练主要依赖文本中心范式，视觉输入仅用于提取稀疏线索。现有方法仍依赖文本作为中间媒介或引入额外视觉生成设计，缺乏纯粹的视觉中心训练。

Method: 将视觉输入分割、打乱，让模型通过自然语言生成正确排列顺序，与可验证奖励的强化学习对齐，无需额外视觉生成组件，自动获取监督信号。

Result: 在图像、视频和3D数据上实验显示，在细粒度感知、时序推理和3D空间理解方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 自监督视觉中心任务在多模态大语言模型后训练中具有巨大潜力，有望激发更多视觉中心预文本设计的研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VGGT-X方法，解决了3D基础模型在密集新视角合成中的内存消耗和输出质量两大关键问题，实现了无需COLMAP的密集视图合成和姿态估计的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的新视角合成方法依赖SfM获取3D属性，速度慢且在低纹理场景中不稳定。3D基础模型虽然速度快，但在密集视图设置下存在内存负担大和输出质量不完美的问题。

Method: VGGT-X包含三个核心组件：内存高效的VGGT实现（可扩展到1000+图像）、用于增强VGGT输出的自适应全局对齐方法，以及鲁棒的3DGS训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著缩小了与COLMAP初始化管线的质量差距，在无需COLMAP的密集新视角合成和姿态估计任务中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: VGGT-X为3D基础模型在密集新视角合成中的应用提供了有效解决方案，分析了与COLMAP初始化渲染的剩余差距，为未来3D基础模型和密集NVS的发展提供了见解。

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is

*Pavan Reddy,Aditya Sanjay Gujral*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了局部对抗攻击，通过在特定区域施加噪声，相比全局攻击实现了更低的像素扰动、更高的PSNR和SSIM，但计算成本更高且攻击成功率略有下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗攻击主要关注全局扰动，而局部对抗噪声的潜力尚未充分探索，需要系统评估其有效性、隐蔽性和计算效率。

Method: 引入二元掩码将噪声限制在特定区域，在FGSM、PGD和C&W等广泛使用的方法上评估局部对抗攻击。

Result: 局部攻击相比全局攻击具有显著更低的平均像素扰动、更高的PSNR和SSIM，但计算量增加且攻击成功率略有降低。迭代方法（如PGD和C&W）比单步方法（如FGSM）对局部化约束更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 局部对抗攻击在隐蔽性方面具有优势，但需要权衡计算成本和攻击成功率，为改进攻击策略和设计鲁棒防御系统提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在上下文持续学习中的记忆保留特性，发现其具有类似人类的分布式练习效应，并提出了一种衡量方法与人脑记忆相似度的指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有大量研究探讨大型语言模型作为少样本学习器的能力，但对其在多任务连续到达时能否实现长期记忆保留和跨任务知识积累的研究仍不足。受人类记忆研究启发，本文旨在探索上下文学习在多任务设置中的记忆保留特性。

Method: 将上下文学习扩展到上下文持续学习，通过任务调度和提示重排实现持续学习能力。在马尔可夫链基准上进行实验，使用分布式练习策略，并提出人类记忆相似度指标来量化持续学习方法与人类记忆动态的契合程度。

Result: 实验表明，对于特定的大型语言模型，上下文持续学习能从分布式练习中获益，显示出类似人类的记忆保留"最佳间隔点"。线性注意力模型如MAMBA和RWKV展现出特别类似人类的记忆模式，尽管其保留性能落后于基于Transformer的LLMs。

Conclusion: 上下文持续学习既具有认知合理性又具有实际有效性，提供了一种仅通过推理实现的持续学习范式，能够缓解灾难性遗忘并解决传统持续学习方法中的稳定性-可塑性困境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning
(ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast
adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner,
whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge
accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored.
Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics
of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning
(ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and
prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that,
for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice
(DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet
spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention
similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method
aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that
linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like
retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of
Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively
plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity
dilemma in conventional CL methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构模型架构间的协作学习挑战，确保互操作性并保护隐私，同时提高通信效率。

Method: 所有客户端采用统一的融合层输出维度，将模型划分为个性化基础块和通用模块块，仅共享融合层输出而不暴露模型参数和架构。

Result: 相比联邦学习（FL）和联邦分割学习（FSL）基线，该框架实现了更优的通信效率，并在异构架构下保持稳定的训练性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了异构模型协作学习中的互操作性和隐私保护问题，同时显著提高了通信效率。

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents
significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We
propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports
model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To
facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output
dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base
block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer
outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication
efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning
(FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across
heterogeneous architectures.

### [357] [On the Capacity of Self-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22840)
*Micah Adler*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了自注意力机制的关系恢复能力，推导出容量缩放定律：总键维度 $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ 对于恢复 $m'$ 个关系是必要且充分的，并提出了基于容量的多头注意力设计原理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知自注意力能够学习token间的关系，但缺乏对其容量的形式化理解：在给定预算下，单层能可靠恢复多少种不同的关系？

Method: 引入关系图识别（RGR）框架，将键-查询通道表示为具有 $m'$ 条有向边的图，分析在给定上下文下恢复每个项目邻居的能力。通过信息论下界和显式构造证明容量缩放定律。

Result: 推导出 $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ 的容量缩放定律，并在受控单层实验中验证了理论预测的尖锐性能阈值，证实了将 $D_K$ 分配到多个头部的好处。

Conclusion: 结果为自注意力容量提供了具体的缩放定律，并为跨头部分配键-查询预算提供了原则性设计规则，特别是在压缩场景下多头的优势。

Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a
formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single
layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the
key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges,
and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We
measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this
framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it
empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both
necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit
construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This
scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head
attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.
When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a
permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >
d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating
interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows
that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this
interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled
single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance
threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit
of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention
capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across
heads.

Method: 结合无梯度方向估计与迭代边界搜索的黑盒决策型对抗攻击方法，能够高效地在离散和连续特征空间中导航，同时最小化对模型的查询次数。

Result: 实验表明该方法成功攻击了几乎所有测试样本，涵盖从经典机器学习分类器到基于大语言模型的流水线，攻击成功率持续超过90%，且每个实例仅需少量查询。

Conclusion: 这些结果凸显了表格模型对对抗性扰动的严重脆弱性，强调了在现实世界决策系统中迫切需要更强的防御措施。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier
compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel
black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our
approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary
search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces
under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models,
ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model
(LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates
consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per
instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models
to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

Motivation: 现有方法使用固定边界或简单评分函数，无法处理偏好强度的变化，且依赖噪声评分信息。偏好强度建模能带来更好的泛化和对齐效果。

Method: 扩展DPO方法为DPO-PoP，利用偏好间的偏好标注来推断每个数据点的自适应边界。提出了两种采样策略来平衡判别性和生成性性能。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，DPO-PoP优于原始DPO、固定边界DPO和真实边界DPO。存在判别性与生成性性能的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 偏好强度建模能有效提升RLHF性能，但需要在判别性和生成性之间进行权衡，提出的采样策略能针对不同目标优化性能。

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

Motivation: 尽管在线学习排序算法在信息检索和推荐系统中广泛应用，但其对协同对抗攻击的脆弱性尚未被充分理解。

Method: 提出两种攻击策略：针对CascadeUCB1的CascadeOFA和针对PBM-UCB的PBMOFA，通过精心设计的操纵来欺骗学习算法。

Result: 理论证明两种策略仅需O(log T)次操纵即可成功，并在真实世界数据上验证了攻击效果。

Conclusion: 在线学习排序算法对协同对抗攻击具有显著脆弱性，需要开发更鲁棒的防御机制。

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval
and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search
engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption,
the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for
attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to
promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K
recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear
regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies:
CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical
guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to
succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical
results on real-world data.

TL;DR: 该论文使用神经正切核理论分析图神经网络中的邻域采样方法，发现不同采样方法在有限样本下产生不同的后验分布，但随着样本增加会收敛到相同分布，且没有一种采样方法在所有情况下都最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 邻域采样是训练大规模图神经网络的重要技术，能抑制邻域大小的指数增长并控制内存和时间消耗。虽然已成为标准实现，但其系统性行为缺乏理论理解。

Method: 使用神经正切核工具分析几种已建立的邻域采样方法及其对应的后验高斯过程，研究有限样本下的训练动态。

Result: 在有限样本下，不同采样方法的GP后验分布各不相同，但随着样本量增加会收敛到相同分布。后验协方差（预测误差下界）不可比较，与观察到的没有采样方法占主导地位的现象一致。

Conclusion: 邻域采样方法在理论上具有不同的行为特性，没有单一方法在所有情况下最优，这解释了实践中观察到的采样方法性能差异现象。

Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of
large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the
neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory
consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in
practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical
analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the
(analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide
counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established
neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With
limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to
the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance,
which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning
with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned
outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing
acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or
synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited
access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly
detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower
plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly
noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then,
we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which
are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage
plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world
conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC
0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered
strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational
cost.

*Yuanyuan Yang,Ruimin Zhang,Jamie Morgenstern,Haifeng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T-Tamer是一个多阶段决策框架，用于优化级联模型的准确性与延迟权衡，证明回访机制是实现可证明性能保证的关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型规模和复杂度的增长，高效服务面临准确率、延迟、资源使用等多目标权衡问题。级联模型中的提前退出决策需要平衡延迟减少与潜在准确率损失，但现有策略多为启发式且缺乏理论保证。

Method: 将级联模型服务形式化为多阶段决策过程，确定何时退出以及咨询哪个模型。核心发现是回访机制（能够重新访问早期模型）对于实现可证明性能保证是必要且充分的。

Result: 实验验证表明，基于回访的策略在合成数据集以及视觉和NLP基准测试的提前退出工作负载中，能够持续产生高效的准确率-延迟权衡。

Conclusion: 回访机制是实现最优权衡的关键，无回访策略无法获得常数因子近似保证，而基于回访的策略可在多项式时间内达到最优权衡，为级联模型设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient
serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency,
resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates
these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision
balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the
pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain
largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees
and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a
multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to
exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the
ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for
achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that
strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to
the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the
optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and
early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that
recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency
trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging
heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and
cascaded models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于智能代理的联邦学习框架FedAgent，旨在解决医疗联邦学习中的实际协调挑战，包括客户端选择、数据预处理、算法选择等。开发了FedAgentBench基准测试，评估LLM代理在医疗联邦学习中的自主协调能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的联邦学习部署面临复杂的操作挑战，需要大量人工干预，包括客户端选择、协调、数据预处理、数据标准化和算法选择等。现有研究忽视了这些实际协调问题，因此需要开发自主的、基于代理的联邦学习系统。

Method: 提出了一个代理驱动的联邦学习框架，涵盖从客户端选择到训练完成的完整工作流程。包含40种联邦学习算法，针对不同任务需求和跨客户端特性定制。使用201个精心策划的数据集，模拟6种医疗环境（皮肤镜、超声、眼底、组织病理学、MRI、X射线）。评估了14个开源和10个专有LLM的代理性能。

Result: 虽然一些代理核心如GPT-4.1和DeepSeek V3能够自动化联邦学习管道的各个阶段，但基于隐含目标的更复杂、相互依赖的任务对于即使是最强大的模型仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 代理驱动的联邦学习框架能够显著减少医疗联邦学习部署中的人工干预需求，但复杂任务的完全自动化仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 将一致性预测(CP)中的公平性框架扩展到联邦学习环境，提出联邦一致性公平性方法，用于审计联邦模型的公平性并验证不同人口群体的公平性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的一致性预测方法虽然能提供概率保证，但对数据集中的敏感属性不敏感。现有的一致性公平性方法需要扩展到联邦学习场景中，以审计联邦模型的公平性。

Method: 扩展一致性公平性框架到联邦学习设置，分析不同人口群体的公平性相关差距，并在多个数据集上进行实证验证，充分利用可交换性假设。

Result: 通过跨多个领域的多个数据集进行实验，验证了所提出框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 成功将一致性公平性框架扩展到联邦学习环境，为审计联邦模型的公平性提供了可行方法。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying
uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers
probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic
to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to
incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across
different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work,
we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we
can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps
for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by
conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully
leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文成功将进化策略（ES）扩展到大规模语言模型（LLM）的全参数微调，证明ES在数十亿参数规模下仍能高效搜索，并在多个方面优于强化学习（RL）微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管进化策略（ES）在百万参数级模型上曾表现出与强化学习（RL）相当的性能，但由于对其扩展到更大模型的悲观预期而被忽视。本文旨在打破这种认知，探索ES在大规模LLM微调中的潜力。

Method: 采用进化策略（ES）方法对预训练大型语言模型进行全参数微调，突破了传统认为ES无法扩展到数十亿参数规模的技术瓶颈。

Result: 实验表明ES在样本效率、长周期奖励容忍度、对不同基础LLM的鲁棒性、奖励黑客攻击倾向较低以及跨运行性能稳定性等多个方面优于现有RL微调方法。

Conclusion: 进化策略为LLM微调开辟了超越当前RL技术的新方向，证明了其在数十亿参数规模下的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在文本、视觉和视频理解方面取得了显著进展，但在轨迹建模领域尚未实现类似突破。本文旨在开发一个能够捕捉人类移动正常模式的移动数据基础模型。

Method: 将移动数据分解为状态（兴趣点类别）和动作（代理转移）两种互补模态，使用双向Transformer和自监督掩码建模目标，跨模态重建缺失片段。

Result: 在Numosim-LA、Urban Anomalies和Geolife等基准数据集上，GPS-MTM在轨迹填充和下一站预测等下游任务中持续优于现有方法，在动态任务中优势最为明显。

Conclusion: GPS-MTM成为了轨迹分析的强大基础模型，将移动数据确立为大规模表示学习的一等模态。

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

Motivation: 传统流形对齐方法无法进行样本外扩展，限制了实际应用。需要开发能够泛化到未见数据的流形对齐方法。

Method: 使用几何正则化的双自编码器架构，通过结构化跨模态映射保持嵌入的几何保真度，结合预训练对齐模型和多任务学习。

Result: 在多个流形对齐方法上评估，显示在嵌入一致性、信息保留和跨域迁移方面有所改进。在阿尔茨海默病诊断中提高了单域情况下的预测准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效整合多模态数据，提高跨域泛化能力和表示鲁棒性，同时保持对齐保真度。

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared
representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable
of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability.
We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a
geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while
enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured
cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By
incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning
formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation
robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using
several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information
preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework
to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate
multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a
single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练内存需求高、推理模型体积大的问题，通过进化训练方法实现模型压缩和训练加速。

Method: 将模型划分为多个结构相同但参数不同的专家子网络，每次只训练一个专家，在AdamW优化后使用交叉、粒子群优化和变异等进化算子让当前专家学习最佳专家的权重经验。

Result: 最佳专家能达到与完整模型几乎相同的准确率，训练吞吐量加速超过10倍，显著减少推理模型大小和训练内存需求。

Conclusion: 该进化训练框架能有效压缩模型、加速训练，且基于纯C++/CUDA实现，适合在PC和边缘计算设备上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large
language models(LLM). The models are divided into several
experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter
values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW
optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on
the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current
expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert
would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight
of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the
same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the
model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the
training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments
show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code
is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy
deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将大语言模型蒸馏建模为约束强化学习问题的新方法，在最大化任务奖励的同时约束与教师模型的差异不超过指定阈值，无需部署时访问教师模型或使用拉格朗日对偶方法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有蒸馏方法通常依赖临时奖励加权，缺乏理论保证。需要一种原则性的优化框架来平衡任务奖励和模型差异约束。

Method: 采用约束状态增强强化学习框架，引入修改后的奖励函数，在蒸馏过程中最大化任务特定奖励，同时约束与教师模型的KL散度不超过阈值。

Result: 在数学推理任务上的实验表明，该方法比软拉格朗日松弛基线具有更好的约束满足率和推理能力，同时保持竞争力的任务性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为资源受限环境下的奖励感知蒸馏提供了理论基础扎实且实际高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by
formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent
work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into
distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward
weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes
task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model
to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state
augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a
modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint
satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access
during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian
methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we
demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and
better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while
maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a
theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware
distillation in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: MonoCon是一个通过功能约束学习高质量、鲁棒、高效和解耦表示的框架，使用小型单调MLP头连接到预训练编码器，在保持性能的同时实现9倍压缩和1.5倍鲁棒性提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI中学习高质量、鲁棒、高效和解耦表示的核心挑战，传统方法主要依赖架构和优化约束，本文引入功能约束作为第三种途径。

Method: 在预训练编码器上附加小型单调多层感知机头，通过对比损失和单调性约束引导编码器与头的协同适应，学习鲁棒、解耦且高度紧凑的嵌入。

Result: 在CIFAR-100图像分类任务中，表示比微调编码器基线紧凑近9倍、鲁棒性高1.5倍，同时保持99%的5-NN分类准确率；在SNLI句子相似性任务中，表示紧凑3.4倍、鲁棒性高1.4倍，STSb分数略有下降。

Conclusion: 通过功能约束学习的鲁棒、超紧凑表示为从边缘计算到云规模检索的不同场景中的关键挑战提供了统一解决方案，证明MonoCon是一个通用的领域无关框架。

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已知将训练分解为全精度(FP)阶段和QAT阶段能提高量化网络精度，但两个阶段间的最优计算分配比例仍不明确，需要系统研究。

Method: 进行了大规模实验，涵盖不同计算预算、QAT位宽(2-8位)和模型规模(86.0M到2.2B)，分析QAT持续时间对最终性能的影响，并推导了损失缩放定律。

Result: 发现QAT与FP训练的最优比例随总计算量增加而增加，且该比例可通过tokens-per-parameter-byte统计量准确预测。提出的冷却与QAT融合方法显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效QAT规划提供了实用指导，能够在相同计算预算下训练出更高质量的量化模型。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the
accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing
training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields
superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of
compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive
experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from
86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final
performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the
loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of
compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide
range of model sizes and quantization widths using the
tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss
scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance
across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We
use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify
experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory
constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to
full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and
QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with
quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates
and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical
insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality
quantized models with the same compute budget.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析Adam、Shampoo和SOAP优化算法在梯度白化视角下的表现，理解它们作为白化矩阵近似的性质，并验证SOAP与Shampoo的理论等价性。

Method: 从梯度白化角度解释优化算法的预条件器，建立SOAP与Shampoo在Kronecker乘积假设下的理论等价性，并通过nanoGPT语言建模和灰度图像着色实验进行验证。

Result: 实验结果显示SOAP与Shampoo具有相似的收敛速度，在最终损失方面没有显著优于Adam和Shampoo，这与理论等价性一致。

Conclusion: SOAP虽然在训练效率上表现良好，但在理论上与Shampoo等价，实际性能表现相似，没有显著优势。

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently
emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training,
achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language
modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the
perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as
approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature
information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized
versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To
empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling
experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show
that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant
advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns
with their equivalence in theory.

TL;DR: SINQ是一种后训练量化方法，通过引入第二轴尺度因子和Sinkhorn-Knopp算法来归一化行列方差，解决低比特量化中的精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前后训练量化方法在4比特及以下时会出现困惑度下降，主要是因为异常值的表示导致共享相同尺度的参数出现精度问题，这在无校准的均匀量化方法中尤为明显。

Method: 在现有后训练量化器基础上增加第二轴尺度因子，使用快速Sinkhorn-Knopp算法找到尺度来归一化每行和每列的方差，最小化矩阵不平衡这一新的量化代理目标。

Result: 在Qwen3模型家族和DeepSeek-V2.5上的评估显示，SINQ显著改善了WikiText2和C4的困惑度，相比无校准均匀量化基线有明显提升。

Conclusion: SINQ方法无需层间交互，可轻松应用于新架构来量化任何线性层，并能与校准和非均匀量化级别结合进一步增强效果。

Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for
deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show
perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because
representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same
scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for
calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment
existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor
and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize
per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy
target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions
between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize
any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and
DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against
uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by
combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to
reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial

by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA
methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become
computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To
address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the

across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization
for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear
advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the
average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$
compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in
ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG
for challenging DA problems.

Motivation: 现有深度生成模型缺乏Neyman正交性这一有利理论特性，无法实现双重鲁棒性和准oracle效率

Conclusion: GDR-learners具有准oracle效率和速率双重鲁棒性，是渐近最优的，为潜在结果分布估计提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential
outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the
favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated
with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we
introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust)
learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our
proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners
based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b)
conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional
variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models
(GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the
properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus
asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the
existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential
outcomes.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves
the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize
from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external
validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and
system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target
distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust
estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to
our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM
evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific
sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these
informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under
evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality
estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality
estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using
persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a
reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We
validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation
Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the
degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a
principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human
ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action
spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel
framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies
in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training
process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging
policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy
distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,
training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This
decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training
performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample
efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks,
including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent
systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior
performance compared to other baselines.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an
effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within
this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical
success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the
off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad"
instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target"
problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor
learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact
off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem
to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the
second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and
often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is
typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy
gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of
functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses
both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We
provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the
provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical
perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network
architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its
effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the
DeepMind Control Benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce FAEclust, a novel functional autoencoder framework for cluster
analysis of multi-dimensional functional data, data that are random
realizations of vector-valued random functions. Our framework features a
universal-approximator encoder that captures complex nonlinear
interdependencies among component functions, and a universal-approximator
decoder capable of accurately reconstructing both Euclidean and manifold-valued
functional data. Stability and robustness are enhanced through innovative
regularization strategies applied to functional weights and biases.
Additionally, we incorporate a clustering loss into the network's training
objective, promoting the learning of latent representations that are conducive
to effective clustering. A key innovation is our shape-informed clustering
objective, ensuring that the clustering results are resistant to phase
variations in the functions. We establish the universal approximation property
of our non-linear decoder and validate the effectiveness of our model through
extensive experiments.

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and
decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental
across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations
research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex
reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural
language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,
achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without
leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate
optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear
programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans
training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common
mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference
strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver
feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs
demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and
feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,
enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

TL;DR: 论文研究了将变分方法融入稀疏自编码器(SAE)是否能改善特征组织和可解释性，但实验表明变分SAE(vSAE)在核心指标上表现不如标准SAE，主要因为KL散度项导致过度正则化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索变分方法是否能改善稀疏自编码器的特征组织和可解释性，假设概率采样能创建分散压力使特征在潜在空间中更连贯地组织。

Method: 提出变分稀疏自编码器(vSAE)，用从学习的高斯后验中进行随机采样替代确定性ReLU门控，并加入向标准正态先验的KL散度正则化。在Pythia-70M变压器残差流激活上评估Topk vSAE与标准TopK SAE。

Result: vSAE在核心评估指标上表现不如标准SAE，但在特征独立性和消融指标上表现优异。KL散度项产生过度正则化压力，显著减少活跃特征比例，导致性能下降。vSAE特征表现出更好的鲁棒性，但死特征数量远多于基线。

Conclusion: 将变分方法简单应用于SAE并不能改善特征组织或可解释性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for
interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse,
human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether
incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature
organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse
Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic
sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence
regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this
probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to
organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We
evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer
residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench,
individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space
visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core
evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics.
The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that
substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed
performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness,
they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that
naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature
organization or interpretability.

Conclusion: 提出的新校准误差定义和相应算法有效解决了多类预测器校准的样本复杂度问题，在理论和实践上都有重要意义。

Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels,
is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible
prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration
error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one
with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample
complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any
given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint,
using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve
nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work.
A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis
with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned audio from silent videos, with potential applications in video editing,
Foley sound design, and assistive multimedia. Although the excellent results,
existing approaches either require costly joint training on large-scale paired
datasets or rely on pairwise similarities that may fail to capture global
multimodal coherence. In this work, we propose a novel training-free multimodal
guidance mechanism for V2A diffusion that leverages the volume spanned by the
modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text.
The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight,
plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio
diffusion model without retraining. Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps
demonstrate that our MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and
multimodal alignment compared to baselines, proving the effectiveness of a
joint multimodal guidance for V2A.

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world
evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent
neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to
encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical.
However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a
single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of
a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space
GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and
generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not
require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can
discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary
measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve
physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds
a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To
discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional
time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to
encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate
the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry
discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on
par with supervised models designed for single systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏MoE需要在固定稀疏度下训练，为满足不同效率目标需维护多个模型，增加了训练、维护成本和部署复杂性。

Method: 通过跨稀疏度混合训练和在高稀疏度下的短课程学习，无需架构改动即可实现单一模型的动态稀疏度控制。

Conclusion: PHDS使全局稀疏度成为MoE服务的一等公民，实现了灵活、可预测的精度/延迟权衡。

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed
sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity
level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently,
meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple
models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance
costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and
energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime
sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf
H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a
single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training
across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity,
requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency
tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time
without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level
heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary
models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds
well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\%
vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE
deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph
learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational
structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations
thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$
(HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge
(combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias
that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological
features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For
$k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In
higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and
potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a
natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's
diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more
expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates
dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware
generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend
prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light --
and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel
theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied
by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the
applied.

Motivation: 标准训练指标如损失无法解释大语言模型中复杂能力的涌现，因此需要从谱分析角度研究学习表示的几何特性变化。

Method: 使用OLMo（1B-7B）和Pythia（160M-12B）模型，通过有效秩（RankMe）和特征谱衰减（α-ReQ）测量自回归预训练和后训练中的表示几何变化。

Result: 发现预训练中存在三个一致的几何阶段：初始塌缩、熵寻求（维度扩展）和压缩寻求（各向异性整合）。后训练中SFT和DPO驱动熵寻求动态，RLVR诱导压缩寻求。

Conclusion: 这些几何阶段源于交叉熵优化与偏斜token频率及表示瓶颈的基本相互作用，后训练进一步塑造模型几何特性以适配特定任务。

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

Method: 提出两阶段训练策略：首先使用最大似然估计从部分任务感知（PTA）和全任务感知（ATA）配置中学习潜在表示，然后优化KL散度来识别和学习共享潜在变量。

Result: 理论和实证验证表明，识别和学习这些共享表示可以有效减轻机器学习系统中的灾难性干扰，在合成和基准数据集上都取得了性能提升。

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a
fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model
progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to
new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic
interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and
propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference
as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting
phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA)
and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in
identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through
identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning,
we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we
employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from
both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to
identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee
and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these
shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in
machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and
practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成个性化差分隐私和自适应模型设计的联邦学习框架，保护训练数据隐私的同时提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G网络需要边缘智能，但联邦学习中参数共享存在数据重建风险，统一全局模型难以适应多样化的本地数据分布。

Method: 使用样本级表示进行知识共享，应用个性化差分隐私策略抵抗重建攻击；开发隐私感知的神经架构搜索算法，生成本地定制化架构和超参数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，相比PerFedRLNAS方法准确率提升6.82%，模型大小减少至1/10，通信成本降低至1/20。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对基于表示的联邦学习的个性化差分隐私解决方案，具有理论收敛保证，在保证强隐私保护的同时显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence
(AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data
utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the
sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter
sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to
adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy
(DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage
sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP
strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware
adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized
architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with
theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy
guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\%
over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10
and communication cost to 1/20.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GuardNet是一种分层过滤框架，通过构建结构化图结合图神经网络来检测和过滤越狱提示，在多个数据集上显著优于现有防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越容易受到越狱攻击，这些对抗性提示会绕过对齐约束，引发未经授权或有害行为，威胁LLM在医疗、金融等关键领域的安全性、可靠性和可信度。

Method: 构建结合顺序链接、句法依赖和注意力派生标记关系的结构化图，捕捉越狱行为的语言结构和上下文模式；应用两层图神经网络：提示级过滤器检测全局对抗性提示，标记级过滤器定位细粒度对抗性跨度。

Result: 在三个数据集和多种攻击设置下，GuardNet显著优于现有防御：在LLM-Fuzzer上将提示级F1分数从66.4%提升至99.8%；在PLeak数据集上从67-79%提升至超过94%；标记级F1从48-75%提升至74-91%，IoU增益高达+28%。

Conclusion: 尽管结构复杂，GuardNet保持了可接受的延迟，在跨域评估中泛化良好，是现实世界LLM部署中对抗越狱威胁的实用且鲁棒的防御方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and
induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the
safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks
in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we
propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters
jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs
that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived
token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns
indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two
levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and
(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.
Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show
that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level
F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\%
on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to
74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity,
GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain
evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats
in real-world LLM deployments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IsingFormer是一种基于Transformer的神经网络，通过生成全局自旋配置来加速马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛采样和组合优化，在Ising模型采样和自旋玻璃优化中显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCMC方法在临界点和复杂能量景观中混合缓慢，并行回火虽然通过温度交换改善混合，但每个副本仍依赖缓慢的局部更新。需要能够生成全局配置的快速采样方法。

Method: 训练Transformer在平衡样本上学习生成整个自旋配置，作为Metropolis步骤中的全局提议，与传统的单自旋翻转相结合，在并行回火框架中使用。

Result: 在2D Ising模型采样中准确重现磁化和自由能曲线，在临界区域显著减少平衡时间；在3D自旋玻璃优化中找到更低能量状态；在整数分解编码问题中成功泛化到未见过的半素数。

Conclusion: IsingFormer证明神经网络提议可以系统性地加速蒙特卡洛方法，通过捕捉全局结构实现更快采样和更强的组合优化性能，并能泛化到整个问题家族。

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and
combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough
landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across
temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its
configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium
samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the
target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for
global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual
single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces
magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures,
including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces
equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses
(optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy
states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes.
Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems,
IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to
unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution.
Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize
across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move
beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer
demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by
neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and
stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

Motivation: 在医疗等隐私敏感领域，联邦学习面临统计异质性挑战。受医疗场景启发，探索服务器能否不仅构建模型，还能指导新患者到最适合的医院。

Method: 引入基于经验似然的框架，同时实现两个目标：(1)在每个客户端学习有效的本地模型，(2)为新查询找到最佳匹配的客户端。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实证结果表明，该框架在模型准确性和客户端指导精度方面均优于标准联邦学习方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更智能、资源效率更高的联邦系统开辟了新方向，将异质性作为特征而非缺陷加以利用。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare,
where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is
statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly
across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient
demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates
from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains
under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a
central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the
hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to
propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the
allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the
network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework
that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on
each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.
Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark
datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of
client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new
direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated
systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型往往依赖预训练中的语言先验而未能充分利用视觉证据，现有分析方法无法揭示视觉信息影响模型行为的内部机制。

Method: 通过链式嵌入分析层间表示动态，识别视觉集成点(VIP)，并开发总视觉集成(TVI)估计器来量化视觉查询对响应生成的影响强度。

Result: 在54个模型-数据集组合(涵盖9个当代LVLM和6个基准测试)中，VIP现象普遍存在，TVI能可靠预测语言先验的强度。

Conclusion: 该方法为诊断和理解LVLM中的语言先验提供了原则性工具包。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal
tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual
patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior
analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the
internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To
address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior
through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise
representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal
phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical
layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden
representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we
introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates
representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query
influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9
contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently
emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This
offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in
LVLMs.

<details>

Motivation: 现有学习率调度器要么遵循简单的参数函数，要么只对短期训练信号做出反应，缺乏对神经网络训练性能的全面时间视图支持。

Method: 将神经网络训练性能建模为动态系统，利用超参数搜索的训练运行学习训练过程的潜在表示，根据当前训练指标预测最佳长期验证性能的学习率调度。

Result: 在CNN、ResNet图像分类和transformer下一词预测任务中达到SOTA结果，训练出的模型位于损失景观更平坦区域，提供更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效、优化器无关，可轻松集成到ML实验跟踪平台上，为学习率调度提供了更智能的解决方案。

Abstract: The learning rate schedule is one of the most impactful aspects of neural
network optimization, yet most schedules either follow simple parametric
functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are
supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually
train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training
performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training
runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the
training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future
learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our
scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates
specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions.
It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as
well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models
are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better
generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is
computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top
of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be
made available after acceptance.

Result: 首次系统证明了"可预测性漂移"现象，发现复杂模型在低可预测性数据上表现更优，而线性模型在更可预测任务上非常有效。

Conclusion: 呼吁从简单聚合分数转向更具洞察力的可预测性感知评估，以促进更公平的模型比较和更深入的行为理解。

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting,
progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards.
However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation
metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic
unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel,
predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our
framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence
Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and
task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given
forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a
frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a
model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We
validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core
insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability
drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over
time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex
models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are
highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift,
moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful,
predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a
deeper understanding of model behavior.

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

Result: 在PAMAP2数据集上，CLAD-Net达到91.36%最终准确率，仅8.78%遗忘率，优于基于记忆和正则化的基线方法。在仅有10-20%标注数据的半监督设置下仍表现良好。

Conclusion: CLAD-Net通过结合自监督transformer和知识蒸馏CNN，有效解决了可穿戴传感器持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，对标注数据稀缺具有鲁棒性，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring
using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While
deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions
- an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor
data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to
distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence
of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are
learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of
labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net
(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling
wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing
performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,
acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The
transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across
body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.
Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge
during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent
final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and
regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight
Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled
data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to
label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

Conclusion: 该框架统一了风险敏感学习和乐观主义，为多智能体强化学习中的合作提供了理论基础和实际有效的方法。

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in
MARL.

Motivation: 激活函数和权重初始化相互依赖，不合适的初始化会导致非线性激活函数引起饱和、方差塌陷和学习率敏感性问题。

Method: 定义了奇Sigmoid函数类，并为该类中的任何激活函数提出专门的初始化方法，通过闭式解选择噪声尺度，确保前向激活值在目标层之前保持良好分散。

Result: 该方法无需归一化层即可可靠训练，表现出强大的数据效率，并且能够使标准初始化方法（Xavier、He、Orthogonal）通常无法可靠收敛的激活函数实现学习。

Conclusion: 提出的初始化方法解决了激活函数与权重初始化的相互依赖问题，为奇Sigmoid类激活函数提供了有效的训练解决方案。

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and
recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However,
activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an
appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation,
variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by
defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this
class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a
noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up
to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation.
Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers,
exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under
which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not
converge reliably.

Motivation: 基于流的策略在离线强化学习中表现出色，但通常受到仅学习单一标量期望回报的评论家限制，无法充分利用其表达能力。

Method: 引入DFC评论家架构，使用流匹配技术将简单基础分布连续变换为复杂回报分布，而非回归到单一值。

Conclusion: DFC通过建模完整回报分布，为基于流的策略提供了更丰富、稳定的学习信号，显著提升了离线强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and
offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex,
multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full
potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,
which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a
novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return
distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow
matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible
transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target
distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based
policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable
and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,
especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in
both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注下游任务性能，而忽略了网络基础模型内部潜在知识的系统性分析。本文旨在通过分析隐藏表示而非纯下游任务性能，深入理解NFMs编码的知识特性。

Method: 采用三部分评估方法：嵌入几何分析评估表示空间利用率，度量对齐评估测量与领域专家特征的一致性，因果敏感性测试评估对协议扰动的鲁棒性。使用五个多样化网络数据集评估四个最先进的NFMs。

Result: 发现所有模型都表现出显著的各向异性、不一致的特征敏感性模式、无法分离高层上下文、负载依赖性等特性。识别出所有模型中的众多局限性，并证明解决这些局限性可显著提升模型性能（F1分数最高提升0.35，无需架构改变）。

Conclusion: 网络基础模型在表示空间利用、特征一致性和鲁棒性方面存在系统性局限性，通过针对性解决这些局限性可以显著改进模型性能，为未来NFMs的设计提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge
encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden
representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance.
Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part
evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space
utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with
domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness
to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning
controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs,
revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature
sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload
dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations
across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly
improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural
changes).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种计算扩散模型对训练数据扰动的敏感性的方法，无需重新训练即可预测模型输出的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练扩散模型是从数据分布到最优评分函数的映射，本文旨在研究如何微分这个映射，从而在投入昂贵的重新训练之前预测模型对训练集微小扰动的响应。

Method: 提出了一种闭式程序来计算该映射的方向导数，仅需预训练评分模型及其对输入的导数的黑盒访问。扩展该方法来估计扩散模型样本对目标测度加性扰动的敏感性。

Result: 该方法对数值和近似误差具有鲁棒性，计算时间与从扩散模型采样和计算样本路径的对数似然相当。得到的敏感性与图像扩散模型重新训练和微调后的样本变化相关。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效预测扩散模型对训练数据扰动的响应，为模型敏感性分析提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$
to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate
this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the
model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set
before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for
computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access
to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We
extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples
to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to
sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample
path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the
resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's
samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了物理信息机器学习中先验领域知识如何影响依赖数据下的学习速率，证明了当物理先验信息对齐时，学习速率可以从缓慢的Sobolev极小极大速率提升到快速的最优i.i.d.速率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决物理信息机器学习中的一个主要挑战：理解在数据依赖情况下，融入先验领域知识如何影响学习速率。

Method: 采用经验风险最小化结合物理信息正则化的方法，推导了概率和期望下的超额风险复杂性相关边界。

Result: 证明了当物理先验信息对齐时，学习速率可以从Sobolev极小极大速率提升到最优i.i.d.速率，且不会因数据依赖性而导致样本量缩减。

Conclusion: 物理先验信息的正确对齐能够显著改善学习性能，使依赖数据下的学习速率达到与独立同分布数据相当的水平。

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how
the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data
are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed
regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in
probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior
information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev
minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation
due to data dependence.

TL;DR: 提出了CE-PO框架，通过增强因果一致性来减少大语言模型中的奖励黑客和不忠实推理问题，在保持准确性的同时提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在强化学习训练中经常通过捷径策略获得表面正确的答案，将正确输出与虚假或不忠实的推理配对，并在小的因果扰动下性能下降。

Method: CE-PO框架使用基于雅可比矩阵的敏感性估计模型内部影响，通过反事实强化抑制干扰线索，并通过Minkowski组合器将因果一致性分数与任务准确性反馈融合。

Result: 在4个数据集上的实验显示，CE-PO平均比基线提高5.49%的准确性（最高达9.58%），同时提高了对相关-因果关系翻转和轻微反事实编辑的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CE-PO能够有效减少奖励黑客和不忠实思维链推理，同时提高模型对因果扰动的鲁棒性，且无需架构更改即可与PPO/GRPO集成。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链的匿名性为非法活动创造了机会，传统反洗钱方法面临挑战，需要能够捕捉结构和时间依赖性的模型，同时抵御噪声、不平衡和对抗行为。

Method: 使用图卷积网络(GCN)、图注意力网络(GAT)和图同构网络(GIN)的集成框架，采用软投票集成方法，并在真实世界的Elliptic数据集上进行调优。

Result: 优化的软投票集成在保持误报率低于1%的同时实现了高非法交易召回率，优于单个GNN模型和基线方法。

Conclusion: 集成GNN是实时加密货币监控的实用且前瞻性解决方案，既提供即时反洗钱效用，又为量子增强金融安全分析铺平道路。

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure,
decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates
opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in
anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in
blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and
temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and
adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that
integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection.
Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves
high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate
below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular
architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future
integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph
neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term
adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight
ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time
cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway
toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了8位Muon优化器，使用分块量化技术，在保持性能的同时显著减少内存占用，优于AdamW和8位AdamW。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在LLM预训练中表现出比AdamW更快的收敛速度和计算效率，但其与AdamW一样需要存储模型权重和累积梯度，存在内存开销问题。现有的8位AdamW变体主要通过动态量化来缓解这个问题，但通常只在动态量化下稳定。

Method: 开发了8位Muon优化器，采用分块量化技术，支持线性和动态两种量化方案。通过理论分析解释了其在量化下的鲁棒性。

Result: 8位Muon相比全精度Muon减少了约74%的内存占用，在预训练1.6B模型和微调Llama 3.2 3B模型的实验中，性能与Muon相当，同时优于AdamW和8位AdamW。

Conclusion: 8位Muon优化器在保持Muon优化器性能优势的同时，显著降低了内存需求，为大规模语言模型训练提供了高效的内存优化解决方案。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown
faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM
pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model
weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this
overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under
dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for
extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using
blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We
demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering
$\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In
extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while
outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb
tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B
model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help
explain this robustness under quantization.

Result: 系统评估了不同物理信息归纳偏置对电压预测模型性能的影响，为可靠高效的配电网电压预测提供了实践指导

Conclusion: 研究揭示了哪些模型假设能最有效地指导学习过程，为现代配电网中可靠高效的电压预测提供了实用见解

Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for
maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor
generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's
ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three
physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii)
complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation.
Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid
configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each
inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and
out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into
which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and
efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

TL;DR: RHYTHM是一个基于大语言模型的人类移动预测框架，通过时间标记化和分层注意力机制处理复杂的长程依赖和多尺度周期性行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类移动预测面临复杂长程依赖和多尺度周期性行为的挑战，现有方法难以有效处理这些特性。

Method: 采用时间标记化将轨迹分割为日段并编码为离散标记，使用分层注意力捕获日和周依赖关系，结合预计算提示嵌入来丰富标记表示，同时冻结预训练LLM主干以减少计算复杂度。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上，RHYTHM相比最先进方法实现整体准确率提升2.4%，周末准确率提升5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM证明了LLM作为通用时空预测器和轨迹推理器的有效性，通过分层时间标记化和冻结主干策略实现了性能提升和效率优化。

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Impute-MACFM是一个用于表格数据插补的掩码感知条件流匹配框架，专门处理随机缺失、随机缺失和不可忽略缺失机制，通过稳定性和一致性正则化实现高效高质量的插补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据（特别是医疗纵向数据）中缺失值普遍存在，会降低模型保真度和可靠性。现有插补方法要么限制性假设过多，要么难以处理复杂的跨特征结构，而生成方法存在不稳定和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 提出掩码感知条件流匹配框架，仅在缺失条目上构建轨迹，同时约束预测速度在观测条目上接近零。结合稳定性惩罚、一致性正则化和时间衰减噪声注入，使用约束保持的ODE积分进行推理。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Impute-MACFM实现了最先进的性能，比竞争方法提供更鲁棒、高效和高质量的插补结果。

Conclusion: 流匹配为表格缺失数据问题（包括纵向数据）提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data
in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and
reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or
struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative
approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose
Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular
imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random,
missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds
trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to
remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules.
Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii)
consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed
noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving
ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix
observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness.
Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while
delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing
approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular
missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法（如GRPO及其变体）在开发推理模型时存在严重的过度自信问题，阻碍了实现自我意识推理模型的目标。

Method: 提出Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG)框架消除token级偏差，使用归一化序列级概率定义模型置信度，并应用交叉熵正则化器将模型置信度校准到序列奖励。

Result: 在逻辑和数学推理任务中对大型语言模型进行后训练，C²GSPG在推理准确性和置信度校准方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: C²GSPG通过置信度校准和GSPG的协同作用，有效解决了强化学习中的过度自信问题，显著提升了推理模型的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at
https://github.com/HaotianLiu123/CCGSPG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逆强化学习方法存在训练不稳定或缺乏理论保证的问题，需要开发既有理论保证又稳定的方法

Method: 提出TRRO理论框架，通过Minorization-Maximization过程保证单调改进，并实例化为PIRO算法，使用信任区域方法联合优化奖励函数和策略

Result: PIRO在MuJoCo、Gym-Robotics基准测试和真实动物行为建模任务中，在奖励恢复、策略模仿和样本效率方面达到或超过最先进基线

Conclusion: TRRO为逆强化学习提供了类似TRPO在正向强化学习中的稳定性保证，PIRO是实用且稳定的IRL算法

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain
expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax)
formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often
lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve
stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations
but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a
unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly
maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing
the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust
Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic
improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We
instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical
and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to
the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward
RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward
recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and
Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

TL;DR: OptiINR是一个统一框架，将隐式神经表示(INR)配置制定为严格的优化问题，通过贝叶斯优化自动寻找最优激活函数和初始化参数组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前INR配置缺乏系统化策略，依赖临时启发式方法或暴力网格搜索，导致跨模态性能不一致，需要建立原则性配置方法。

Method: 使用贝叶斯优化在离散激活函数族（如SIREN、WIRE、FINER）和连续初始化参数的联合空间中高效搜索最优配置。

Result: OptiINR能够提供全局最优配置，在各种信号处理应用中持续最大化性能。

Conclusion: OptiINR为INR设计建立了原则性基础，用数据驱动的优化过程取代了分散的手动调优。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from
image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is
fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal
configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,
layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices
dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies
on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often
leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces
OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a
rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR
efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as
sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and
their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach
replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization
process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a
principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance
across diverse signal processing applications.

TL;DR: 提出了Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE)机制，将键值对重新构想为局部专家，通过局部过滤无关时间戳实现自适应专家选择，同时保留全局专家以捕捉长程依赖，显著提升了时间序列预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Transformer在时间序列建模中的两个关键问题：(1)固有的滞后效应，历史时间戳对查询的相关性动态变化；(2)异常段引入噪声信号降低预测准确性。

Method: 提出TMOE注意力机制，将键值对作为局部专家，每个专家专门处理不同的时间上下文，通过局部过滤无关时间戳实现自适应专家选择，同时保留共享全局专家。将TMOE集成到PatchTST和Timer框架中，分别得到TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G。

Result: 在七个真实世界长期预测基准测试中，TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: TMOE机制有效解决了时间序列建模中的滞后效应和异常段问题，在不增加额外结构修改的情况下显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling
global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all'
context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world
data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to
a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy
signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we
propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism
that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a
distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each
query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this
local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength
in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention
mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and
Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific
version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on
seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert
and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了Mirror-Critique框架，通过对比模型生成解与真实解来训练具备信息性批判能力的验证器，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的奖励模型选择方法在测试时缩放中经常无法识别少数但正确的答案，限制了其超越简单多数投票的效果，这源于验证器训练中缺乏信息性批判信号。

Method: 利用小型指令调优模型通过拒绝采样合成高质量批判数据，教导验证器不仅知道什么是错误的，还知道为什么错误。使用合成数据冷启动LLMs的RLVR过程，通过生成多个批判并聚合成验证分数用于加权投票或选择性弃权。

Result: 实验结果显示Mirror-Verifier在解决方案准确性方面显著优于多数投票，并提高了求解器识别和弃权超出其能力边界问题的诚实性。

Conclusion: Mirror-Critique框架通过提供信息性批判信号有效提升了验证器的性能，为LLMs的推理能力改进提供了新途径。

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key
paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it
often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its
effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this
limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier
training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that
trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage
the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with
ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize
high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier
not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start
the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The
resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by
generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify
score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental
results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting
in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to
recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

Method: 开发CrystalGym强化学习环境，使用DFT直接计算材料特性（如带隙、体模量、密度），并对常见的基于值和策略的强化学习算法进行基准测试。

Result: 实验显示不同算法在样本效率和收敛到最优解的难易程度上表现各异，但没有一种算法能解决所有CrystalGym任务。还进行了大语言模型微调的研究。

Conclusion: CrystalGym为强化学习研究者和材料科学家提供了处理耗时奖励信号的真实世界设计问题测试平台，推动了面向实际应用的跨学科机器学习研究。

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.

Motivation: 临床评估频率低且缺乏敏感性，难以捕捉老年人细微的认知衰退，被动智能手机传感为自然连续认知监测提供了有前景的方法。

Method: 基于多模态传感数据提取日常行为特征序列，使用LSTM模型检测认知障碍，采用例行感知增强（生成行为相似替代日的合成序列）和人口统计个性化（重加权训练样本以强调与测试参与者人口统计相似的个体）技术增强模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这些技术显著提高了认知障碍检测性能，突出了被动传感在老年人群认知障碍可扩展监测方面的潜力。

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and
intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults.
Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic
and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from
sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data
collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions
are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)
routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing
each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic
personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from
individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on
6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and
demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of
scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive
sensing.

TL;DR: ProtoTS是一个可解释的时间序列预测框架，通过建模原型时间模式实现高精度和透明决策，提供多级可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释模型只能提供局部和部分解释，无法揭示异质输入变量如何共同塑造预测曲线中的整体时间模式，在关键场景中缺乏可信度。

Method: 基于去噪表示计算实例-原型相似度，通过分层组织原型来捕获全局时间模式和局部细粒度变化，支持专家引导。

Result: 在多个现实基准测试（包括新发布的LOF数据集）中，ProtoTS在预测精度上超过现有方法，并提供专家可引导的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoTS不仅实现了更高的预测精度，还通过多级可解释性为模型理解和决策支持提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series
forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making
process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable
models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the
capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly
shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS,
a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy
and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal
patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised
representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The
prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns
with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with
detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.
Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF
dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast
accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model
understanding and decision support.

*Chandan Tankala,Krishnakumar Balasubramanian*

TL;DR: 将密集关联记忆从向量扩展到概率分布，特别是高斯密度，使用2-Wasserstein距离定义能量函数和检索动态，实现分布存储和检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集关联记忆模型仅限于向量表示，需要扩展到概率分布以支持更丰富的表示形式，连接经典关联记忆与现代生成建模。

Method: 定义基于存储分布的log-sum-exp能量函数，以及通过最优传输映射的Gibbs加权聚合检索动态，固定点对应自一致的Wasserstein重心。

Result: 证明了指数存储容量，提供了Wasserstein扰动下的定量检索保证，并在合成和真实世界分布任务上验证了模型有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作将关联记忆从向量提升到完整分布，为记忆增强学习中的分布存储和检索提供了新框架。

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via
energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector
representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the
2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of
Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored
distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a
Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent
Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove
exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under
Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world
distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to
full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and
enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究参数高效微调(PEFT)在科学机器学习中的应用，发现Adapter在大型算子模型中的表现优于LoRA，并提出基于频谱复杂度的F-Adapter方法，在3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调在视觉和语言处理中已被证明有效，但在科学机器学习领域尚未探索，该领域目标是建模复杂物理系统。

Method: 引入频率自适应适配器(F-Adapter)，根据频谱复杂度分配适配器容量，对低频分量使用高维模块，对高频分量使用低维模块。

Result: F-Adapter在多个具有挑战性的3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中建立了最先进的结果，显著提高了泛化能力和频谱保真度。

Conclusion: 这是首个探索科学机器学习中PEFT的工作，确立了F-Adapter作为该领域有效范式的地位。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for
complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language
processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine
learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct
the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs)
obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that
the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance
on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that
stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within
Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and,
by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain
exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain.
Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical
characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce
Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity
based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to
low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency
components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both
generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques
commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an
effective paradigm for this domain.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZeroSiam是一种用于测试时熵最小化的高效非对称孪生架构，通过非对称散度对齐防止模型崩溃，在视觉适应和大语言模型推理任务中表现稳定且高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯熵最小化可能导致模型选择非泛化捷径（如膨胀logit范数或将所有预测推向主导类别），从而产生崩溃解（如恒定one-hot输出），无法实现有意义的学习。

Method: 提出ZeroSiam非对称孪生架构，通过可学习预测器和分类器前的stop-gradient操作实现高效的非对称散度对齐，防止崩溃。

Result: ZeroSiam不仅防止崩溃解，还能吸收和正则化有偏学习信号，在各种测试场景和不同模型（包括易崩溃的小型模型）中表现稳定且高效。

Conclusion: ZeroSiam通过简单而有效的非对称架构设计，解决了测试时熵最小化中的崩溃问题，在多个任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and
incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during
inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own
predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy
minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit
norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking
collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize
the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce
ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time
entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence
alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a
stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but
also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance
even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show
that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible
overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language
model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models,
including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

Motivation: 联邦学习面临恶意客户端攻击、推理攻击威胁，以及难以激励参与者在严格隐私要求下贡献高质量数据的挑战。

Method: 集成主动警报机制和鲁棒聚合防御拜占庭和推理攻击，使用Tullock竞赛启发式激励机制奖励诚实客户端，将服务器与客户端的交互建模为两阶段Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，CoSIFL在提高模型鲁棒性和降低服务器总成本方面优于现有解决方案，证明了集成设计的有效性。

Conclusion: CoSIFL框架通过安全、隐私和激励的集成设计，为联邦学习提供了有效的解决方案，能够平衡系统效率和安全性。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces
challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in
incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy
requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel
framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local
differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a
Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data
sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust
aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock
contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data
contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between
the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server
determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration
settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size,
privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client
game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional
attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect
system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and
reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated
design.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面研究了MXFP4和NVFP4两种4位浮点格式在LLM推理中的实际表现，发现现有方法在FP4量化中存在两个关键问题，并提出了MR-GPTQ算法来优化FP4量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件加速的4位浮点格式（MXFP4和NVFP4）在理论上能显著提升LLM推理性能，但实际效果尚未得到验证。本文旨在评估这些格式的实际表现并解决其量化问题。

Method: 提出了Micro-Rotated-GPTQ（MR-GPTQ）算法，通过块级Hadamard变换和格式特定优化来适配FP4特性，并开发了高性能GPU内核实现旋转融合和快速激活计算。

Result: 在NVIDIA B200上实现了层间3.6倍和端到端2.2倍的加速，在RTX5090上实现了层间6倍和端到端4倍的加速。MR-GPTQ显著提升了MXFP4的精度，使其接近NVFP4水平。

Conclusion: 虽然FP4不是INT4的自动升级，但像MR-GPTQ这样的格式专用方法能够解锁精度与性能权衡的新前沿。

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats
such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to
revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical
benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and
NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and
real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods
struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably
neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two
scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the
classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to
FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and
format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of
high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible
overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of
the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and
2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on
RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the
point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an
automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock
a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICRL方法在测试时无法像训练数据那样持续改进性能，存在上下文模糊性问题——模型自身的随机动作可能生成与训练数据中次优策略相似的交互历史，导致恶性循环。

Method: 提出CV-ICRL方法，在训练阶段引入上下文价值作为显式信号，表示给定当前上下文时理论上可达到的理想性能。随着上下文扩展，上下文价值应非递减。提出了两种在训练和测试时估计上下文价值的方法。

Result: 在Dark Room和Minigrid测试平台上的实验表明，CV-ICRL有效缓解了性能下降问题，并在各种任务和环境中提升了ICRL的整体能力。

Conclusion: 上下文价值通过收紧相对于理想单调改进策略的性能差距下界，成功解决了ICRL中的上下文模糊性问题，为ICRL提供了更可靠的学习框架。

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past
experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches
train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online
RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our
experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a
continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,
we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own
stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly
resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a
vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we
introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed
ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing
the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current
context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant
information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We
prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap
relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two
methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.
Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that
CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL
abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of
this paper are available at

Motivation: 大型语言模型在通用数学推理上表现优异，但在需要精确处理信息论边界、优化约束和信号处理公式的无线通信专业数学问题上表现不佳。

Method: 利用无线数学问题具有可验证正确性的特性，采用基于组相对策略优化（GRPO）的强化学习方法，使用二元验证奖励直接从基础检查点训练模型，无需监督预热。

Result: 7B参数模型在WirelessMathBench-XL基准测试上达到39.5%准确率，接近GPT-4o（40.4%），同时参数数量比DeepSeek-R1（671B，57.4%）少约100倍。GRPO训练使所有模型规模的性能几乎翻倍，并在未训练过的通用数学基准测试上平均提升8.4分。

Conclusion: 紧凑模型通过领域特定的强化学习可以在专业数学领域取得与大型模型相媲美的性能，同时具备向通用数学任务的迁移能力，验证了无线数学问题的可验证性特性对有效强化学习的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail
catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless
communications, where problems require precise manipulation of
information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing
formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent
performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models
(0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through
domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight
is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable
correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human
feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027
problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints
without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on
WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times
fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training
nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B
+81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models
gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and
AIME without any training on these tasks.

TL;DR: SPEC-RL是一个将推测解码与RL rollout过程集成的新框架，通过重用先前轨迹段作为推测前缀，避免冗余生成，将rollout时间减少2-3倍而不影响策略质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM的RLVR训练过程受限于计算昂贵的rollout阶段，现有加速方法要么收益递减、引入偏差，要么忽略了迭代间的冗余。连续训练epoch的rollout经常有大量重叠段，浪费计算。

Method: 提出SPEC-RL框架，集成推测解码与RL rollout过程，重用先验轨迹段作为推测前缀，通过草稿-验证机制扩展，避免冗余生成同时确保策略一致性。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500、OlympiadBench、MMLU-STEM等数学推理和泛化基准测试中，SPEC-RL将rollout时间减少2-3倍，且不损害策略质量。

Conclusion: SPEC-RL作为纯rollout阶段增强，可与PPO、GRPO、DAPO等主流算法无缝集成，为大规模推理模型的RLVR扩展提供了通用实用的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界回归任务中数据分布严重偏斜，模型主要从丰富的多数样本中学习，难以准确预测少数标签。深度不平衡回归缺乏适合高维数据的专用数据级解决方案。

Method: 使用条件扩散模型在潜在表示空间中进行基于优先级的特征生成，计算高效且适用于图像、文本等高维输入。

Result: 在三个深度不平衡回归基准测试中，在少数区域取得了显著改进，同时保持了整体准确性。

Conclusion: LatentDiff填补了深度不平衡回归中数据级解决方案的空白，为高维数据提供了有效的特征合成方法。

Abstract: In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed,
and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to
predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been
extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep
imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are
high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for
tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks
dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies
primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose
LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with
priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent
representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable
across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other
high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall
accuracy.

Method: ATDP是DP-SGD的改进版本，自适应地为敏感和非敏感token分配不同梯度权重，在训练早期使用更大噪声规模，仅需少量轻量级后处理轮次。

Result: ATDP显著减少DP微调的计算开销，缩短训练时间约90%，同时实现可比或更优的隐私保护，准确率下降最小。

Conclusion: ATDP可无缝集成到现有DP微调流程中，或直接应用于非私有模型作为快速隐私增强措施，形成简化的DP流程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal
information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of
differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise
into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing
model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients
associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,
strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve
the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight
through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of
vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive
and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage
of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a
result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight
post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise
primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally
affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated
into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to
non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined
with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP
pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD
methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning,
shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving
comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

*Vladimir Fanaskov,Vladislav Trifonov,Alexander Rudikov,Ekaterina Muravleva,Ivan Oseledets*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于神经网络的高维参数空间子空间回归方法，通过预测比所需维度更大的子空间来简化学习问题并提高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统参数化降阶建模中，高维参数空间使得经典插值策略不可行或不可靠，需要更有效的子空间近似方法。

Method: 将插值问题松弛为回归问题，引入适合子空间数据的损失函数，使用神经网络近似高维目标函数，并通过预测更大维度的子空间来简化学习问题。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法降低了椭圆特征问题的映射复杂度，使Grassmann流形上的映射更平滑；实验结果显示预测更大子空间能显著提高精度。

Conclusion: 子空间回归方法在参数特征问题、紧缩技术、松弛方法、最优控制和参数偏微分方程求解等任务中具有实用价值。

Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear
subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach
becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on
parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute
subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding
offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown
parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is
high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible
or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,
introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural
network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further
simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting
subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically
that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic
eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for
general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show
that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are
predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace
regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric
eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and
solution of parametric partial differential equations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NanoFlux是一个对抗性框架，通过生成少于200个示例的针对性训练数据，在提升LLM推理能力方面优于传统微调方法，同时大幅降低计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法需要大量数据且计算成本高，而小规模但精确针对性的训练数据可能更有效地提升模型推理能力。

Method: 采用对抗性框架，模型交替扮演攻击者和防御者角色，由工具增强的法官监督，生成带解释性标注的多步骤问题，针对特定推理能力。

Result: 在4B参数模型上，NanoFlux生成的数据相比全基准微调：数学推理提升5.9%，科学推理提升3.6%，医学推理提升16.6%，计算需求减少3-14倍。

Conclusion: 未来模型改进可能在于智能合成小规模、精确针对性的训练数据集，而非依赖大规模数据。

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted
training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets
containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning
approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models
alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge,
synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target
specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on
NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains
compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning
(GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical
reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x.
Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset
characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal
points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates
training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering,
tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future
model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely
targeted training datasets.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for
vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.
However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the
Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a
biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the
physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery
without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can
accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen
sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information.
In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on
a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based
methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further
quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to
conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the
precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release
the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

Conclusion: CREPE为扩散模型推理时控制提供了灵活高效的解决方案，在保持多样性的同时实现多任务控制。

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to
satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly
relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative
based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling
problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica
Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2)
maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and
(3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its
versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing,
reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with
competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

Motivation: 基因组预后工具成本高且不易获取，而临床病理预后更经济易得。机器学习、迁移学习和集成方法为构建稳健的预后框架提供了机会。

Conclusion: 在PREDICT v3相关信息缺失或可能存在数据集偏移的情况下，迁移学习、从头训练RSF和集成方法能够改善乳腺癌的预后预测能力。

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer
management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic
prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less
costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and
ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication
frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in
breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained
prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used
for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER
cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic
tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme
Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum
of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration
improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from
0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC
increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3
predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing
information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict
survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age,
nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values,
indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation
in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and
ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo
RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where
relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is
likely.

Method: 采用模型无关的策略梯度软演员-评论家算法，为演员引入自适应探索，为评论家引入计划性探索，在连续时间线性二次型框架下同步管理资产和负债。

Result: 在200个随机市场情景中测试，该方法在所有替代策略中获得了更高的平均奖励，具有快速的初始收益和持续的优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法优于传统金融策略和现有强化学习算法，其优势不在于复杂神经网络或改进参数估计，而在于无需学习环境即可直接学习最优资产负债管理策略。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by
employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic
(LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We
develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm
tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure
an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning,
we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for
the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced
traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and
three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market
scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative
strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The
outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter
estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without
learning the environment.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic
management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper
introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight
Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining
analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a
more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art
models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4
performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in
the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements
across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations,
including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR
data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary
differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft
performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a
full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

Conclusion: ASTGI框架通过自适应时空图交互机制，有效解决了不规则多元时间序列预测中的核心挑战，在多个领域展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains
like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive
decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals
inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to
accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without
introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex
dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges,
we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework.
Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point
Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a
learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive
Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in
the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a
Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on
these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction
weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points.
Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by
aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing
regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 循环深度transformer的迭代过程具有两尺度几何特性，基于二阶步长差异的早退机制是更优的退出策略。

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent
computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates
and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a
looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across
consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across
checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and
increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling
of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These
dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order
difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance,
stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy
of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

Abstract: Regression is essential across many domains but remains challenging in
high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure
or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued

MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based
Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost
Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to
preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global
features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their
internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability
tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract
interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling,
instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical
guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical
confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation
learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent
concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to
inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable
temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for
LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and
instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees
and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world
complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we
successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our
findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual
relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

Motivation: 现代机器学习中，微调预训练模型是标准有效的工作流程，但鲁棒微调(RFT)在同时实现下游任务适应性和对抗样本鲁棒性方面仍然具有挑战性。尽管开源库中有大量非鲁棒预训练模型，但它们在RFT中的潜力尚未被充分理解。

Conclusion: Epsilon-Scheduling方法有效解决了从非鲁棒预训练模型进行鲁棒微调时的次优迁移问题，为RFT提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the
Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine
learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While
recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing
interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable
way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.
We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces.
Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically
known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building
this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and
additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM
algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both

TL;DR: 提出了一种在隐式数据流形上进行黎曼优化的方法，通过连接函数将数据分布与几何操作联系起来，并开发了两种高效推理算法DLF和DRGD。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维数据集中在低维流形上时，当流形仅通过数据分布隐式给出且缺乏标准流形操作的情况下，如何进行黎曼优化的问题。

Method: 引入连接函数将数据分布与几何操作联系起来，利用扩散模型中的分数函数，提出了DLF和DRGD两种推理算法。

Result: 建立了与扩散模型分数函数的直接联系，能够利用预训练分数网络进行优化，在数据驱动控制任务中展示了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为现代生成AI中的数据驱动设计问题提供了实用解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated
near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian
optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through
the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by
classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class
of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our
key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to
the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function
enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and
Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection
between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data
distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied
parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score
networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building
on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms --
Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD)
-- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate
manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference
tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical
generative and design applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文理论分析了连续思维链(continuous CoT)在训练过程中如何自然学习叠加机制，揭示了两阶段训练动态：思维生成阶段和预测阶段，以及索引匹配logit的平衡作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补连续CoT中叠加机制如何从基于梯度的训练方法中自然学习的理论空白，理解transformer在解决有向图可达性问题时的训练动态。

Method: 理论分析简化两层transformer在有向图可达性问题上的训练动态，包括思维生成阶段和预测阶段，追踪索引匹配logit的变化规律。

Result: 发现索引匹配logit在训练中先增加后保持有界，有效平衡推理过程中的探索与利用，导致叠加机制的自然出现。实验验证了理论分析。

Conclusion: 连续CoT通过索引匹配logit的有界性自然学习叠加机制，使模型能够同时维护多个推理轨迹，平衡局部搜索和全局探索。

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT)
improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight
by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can
efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of
multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains
unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from
gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the
training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph
reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during
training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that
autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage
that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that
during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an
important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search
ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions.
The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and
exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem
structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights
to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is
correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the
growth of logits further validate our theory.

*Ange-Clément Akazan,Verlon Roel Mbingui*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络(KANs)的特征选择方法，包括KAN-L1、KAN-L2、KAN-SI、KAN-KO四种选择器，在表格数据集上与经典基线方法进行比较，显示出竞争性甚至更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集需要有效的特征选择来提高预测性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。传统方法可能无法充分捕捉非线性特征关系。

Method: 利用KANs通过样条参数化特征变换，直接获取可解释的重要性度量。提出四种KAN-based选择器并与LASSO、随机森林、互信息、SVM-RFE等经典方法进行比较。

Result: KAN-based选择器在结构和合成数据集上具有竞争力，有时优于经典基线。KAN-L2和KAN-SI在噪声回归和异构数据集上表现稳健，KAN-L1、KAN-KO、KAN-SI在分类任务中有时表现最佳。

Conclusion: KAN-based特征选择为传统方法提供了强大且可解释的替代方案，能够发现超越稀疏性或基于不纯度度量的非线性和多变量特征相关性。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve
predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and
evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations
through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures.
We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical
baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple
classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three
retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results
reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive
with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic
datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression,
removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in
classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature
interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust
performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning
closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such
as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes
surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in
high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative
to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate
feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

*Xi Ding,Lei Wang,Piotr Koniusz,Yongsheng Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了图一致性正则化(GCR)框架，通过将模型预测衍生的关系图结构注入学习过程，促进类感知的语义特征表示。该框架作为自提示机制，让模型利用自身输出来精化内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络学习到的丰富表示常常捕获与模型预测语义相矛盾的噪声类间相似性，需要解决特征表示与预测语义不一致的问题。

Method: 在任意深度引入参数无关的图一致性层(GCLs)，构建批次级特征相似图并与全局类感知掩码预测图对齐，通过多层级跨空间图对齐机制和自适应权重学习来增强语义结构。

Result: 实验表明GCR促进了更清晰的特征结构、更强的类内凝聚力和改进的泛化能力，在各种网络和数据集上都能提升语义结构质量。

Conclusion: GCR提供了一种从预测结构学习的新视角，是模型无关、轻量级的方法，能够在不修改架构或训练过程的情况下提升特征质量。

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL)方法，通过新的Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO)来解决扩散语言模型中训练与推理路径不匹配的问题，在蛋白质序列建模、文本生成和代码生成等多个领域取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过灵活的并行生成路径实现快速推理，但规划器引入的反向路径修改导致了训练时使用的均匀随机去噪路径与推理时基于规划路径之间的不匹配问题。

Method: 推导了新的Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO)，将基于规划器的反向动态直接纳入训练目标，并提出了Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL)方法，这是对标准掩码离散扩散损失的简单有效修改。

Result: PAPL在多个领域带来一致改进：蛋白质序列建模相对增益40%，文本生成MAUVE指标提升高达4倍，代码生成HumanEval pass@10相对增益23%。

Conclusion: 通过将规划器感知的路径学习纳入训练目标，可以有效解决扩散语言模型中训练与推理路径不匹配的问题，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel
generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or
planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather
than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths,
planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used
during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work,
we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the
standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not
accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap,
we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly
incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective.
Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and
effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that
aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL
delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain
in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text
generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个多路图链接预测框架，将问题建模为多视图边分类，使用跨层自注意力融合不同层的证据，并引入了可扩展的候选池和无泄漏协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么合并图层要么独立处理图层，这会丢失关键的层间依赖关系且难以扩展。需要一种能够有效融合多层信息并保持可扩展性的方法。

Method: 将多路链接预测构建为多视图边分类，为每个节点对构建每层边视图序列，应用跨层自注意力融合目标层证据。提出了Trans-SLE（基于静态嵌入）和Trans-GAT（结合层特定GAT编码器）两个模型实例。

Result: 在六个公共多路数据集上的实验显示，相比强基线方法（MELL、HOPLP-MUL、RMNE）取得了持续的macro-F1提升。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，且兼容预计算嵌入和GNN编码器，能够有效处理多路图中的层间依赖关系。

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most
predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses
crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome
this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For
each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply
cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present
two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer
over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT
encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we
introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols:
cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public
multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL,
HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both
precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PATCH是一种混合稀疏框架，通过将权重矩阵划分为图块并学习选择密集或2:4稀疏模式，实现0%-50%的连续稀疏率，在保持准确性的同时获得实际加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型剪枝方法面临两难：非结构化稀疏保持精度但无法GPU加速，而半结构化2:4稀疏硬件友好但强制50%模式会降低模型质量。需要一种能平衡精度与加速的灵活稀疏方法。

Method: 将权重矩阵划分为图块，通过可学习的掩码选择机制为每个图块分配密集或2:4稀疏模式，支持跨层非均匀稀疏分布和连续稀疏率控制。

Result: 在0.5B到8B参数模型上，PATCH持续缩小与密集模型的精度差距并获得实际加速。在LLaMA-2 7B上实现1.18x-1.38x端到端加速，相比最先进的2:4剪枝方法MaskLLM精度提高0.37%-2.96%。

Conclusion: PATCH框架成功解决了现有稀疏方法的局限性，通过混合稀疏设计在保持模型质量的同时实现了有效的计算加速，为大型语言模型的部署提供了更好的精度-加速权衡方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur
prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an
effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face
challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,
preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU
acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but
enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,
we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous
sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,
assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask
selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over
accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across
layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B
parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while
delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,
PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while
improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning
method, MaskLLM.

TL;DR: URS是一个统一的神经路由求解器，能够使用单一模型在未见过的车辆路径问题变体上进行零样本泛化，无需微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器通常依赖预定义问题约束或需要针对每个问题进行微调，这严重限制了它们在未见VRP变体上的零样本泛化能力。

Method: 提出统一数据表示(UDR)替代问题枚举，开发混合偏置模块(MBM)学习几何和关系偏置，使用参数生成器自适应调整解码器和偏置权重，并采用LLM驱动的约束满足机制。

Result: URS能够为100多个不同的VRP变体（包括90多个未见变体）持续生成高质量解决方案，无需任何微调。

Conclusion: URS是首个能够使用单一模型处理超过100个VRP变体的神经求解器，实现了显著的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for
their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single
model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem
constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits
their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this
critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of
zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single
model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data
representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification,
thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain
expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently
learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top
of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively
adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot
generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction
mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise
masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more
than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more
than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural
solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LOTFormer是一种同时具备线性时间复杂度和双随机性的注意力机制，通过将注意力映射建模为查询和键之间的传输计划，并使用低秩约束来实现高效计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax注意力机制的二次复杂度限制了Transformer在长上下文窗口中的扩展性，而现有的线性注意力机制虽然解决了计算复杂度问题，但通常会产生行归一化的注意力映射，可能导致过度关注少数token，影响鲁棒性和信息流动。

Method: 利用注意力映射与查询和键之间的传输计划之间的联系，通过将传输计划约束为低秩形式（使用具有小支撑集的可学习枢轴度量），解决两个熵最优传输问题（查询→枢轴和枢轴→键），并将它们组合成条件耦合，从而产生可证明双随机的注意力矩阵。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中达到最先进的结果，在准确性和效率方面都超过了先前的线性和基于传输的注意力方法。

Conclusion: LOTFormer提供了一种原则性的方法，同时实现了线性时间复杂度和双随机性，有效解决了长序列建模中的计算复杂度和注意力分布平衡问题。

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.
However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism
poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large
body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention
as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve
linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention
mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can
over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.
Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token
participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention
mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.
We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously
linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between
attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The
central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning
it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two
entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys)
and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention
matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and
applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map.
The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing
prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and
efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文研究了Hessian矩阵近似质量对影响函数数据归因性能的影响，发现在分类任务中更好的Hessian近似能持续提升影响分数质量，并识别了K-FAC特征值不匹配是主要误差来源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 影响函数需要计算大而病态的Hessian矩阵逆，现有近似方法如GGN和K-FAC虽然使计算可行，但近似对数据归因性能的影响尚不明确，需要系统评估不同Hessian近似方法的效果。

Method: 在受控分类设置下，系统比较不同Hessian近似方法对影响函数归因性能的影响，分解K-FAC等方法的近似步骤并评估每个步骤对归因准确性的贡献。

Result: 实验表明更好的Hessian近似持续产生更好的影响分数质量，K-FAC特征值与GGN/EK-FAC特征值的不匹配是主要误差来源和影响损失原因。

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进Hessian近似的研究提供了依据，并指明了哪些近似步骤对归因准确性最为关键，有助于在计算可行性和归因准确性之间取得平衡。

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to
training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert
a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised
Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have
been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear
how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance.
Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are
derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even
lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a
controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian
approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering
justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further
decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and
evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch
between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority
of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations
are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability
and attribution accuracy.

Motivation: 用户隐私保护和法规遵从要求在模型训练中移除敏感数据，但这一过程往往导致分布偏移，特别是在分布外场景下会削弱模型性能。

Method: 引入判别保持因子去相关模块（使用动态自适应权重调整和迭代表示更新）来减少特征冗余和最小化特征间相关性，以及带有损失扰动的平滑数据移除机制来创建信息论防护。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他基线方法，即使在显著分布偏移下也能持续实现高预测准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在分布内和分布外场景下都表现出卓越的效率和适应性，为隐私保护下的模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance
necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often
induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach
that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss
perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor
decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative
representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature
correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that
creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal
operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our
approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive
accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results
highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Motivation: 大规模数值模拟计算成本高昂，现有AI替代模型在关键任务应用中存在物理合理性、可信度和异构数据融合的局限性。

Method: PHASE结合了异构输入的数据类型感知编码器和多级物理约束，从局部动力学到全局系统行为保持一致性。

Result: 仅使用前20年模拟数据，PHASE就能推断出原本需要1200多年积分才能达到的近平衡状态，有效减少所需积分长度至少60倍。

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but
remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer
acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns
over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous
data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for
physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations.
PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with
multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local
dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical
(BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first
scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the
first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise
requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction
in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a
pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong
generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These
results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather
than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent
acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance.
To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples
with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for
\emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em
batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented
\emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and
hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model
performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to
incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning,
\textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP)
consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various
pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time.
Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of
modern large-scale machine learning.

TL;DR: GEMS是一个替代PSRO的生成式进化元求解器，通过紧凑的潜在锚点和摊销生成器取代显式种群，使用蒙特卡洛模拟和元动态方法，在保持博弈论保证的同时实现6倍速度提升和1.3倍内存减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体强化学习中基于种群的PSRO方法存在的二次计算复杂度和线性内存成本问题，实现可扩展的多智能体学习。

Method: 使用紧凑潜在锚点和摊销生成器替代显式种群；基于无偏蒙特卡洛模拟、乘性权重元动态和无模型经验伯恩斯坦UCB预言机；在生成器内使用基于优势的信任域目标训练最佳响应。

Result: 在双人和多人游戏中，GEMS比PSRO快约6倍，内存使用减少1.3倍，同时获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: GEMS在保持PSRO博弈论保证的同时，克服了其基本效率问题，为多领域可扩展多智能体学习提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

TL;DR: 提出POC框架，通过近端策略优化和变点检测来平衡MILP重求解的性能与成本，在8个数据集上比基线方法提升2%-17%。


<details>

Motivation: 解决实时操作中何时重新求解计算密集型MILP优化问题的经济决策难题，现有方法主要关注启发式、低数据设置和平滑目标，缺乏对常见NP-hard MILP问题的系统研究。

Method: 提出POC框架，结合近端策略优化和变点检测，建立重求解次数与成本的关系模型，系统性地决定合适的重求解时机。

Result: 在8个合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，POC框架始终优于现有基线方法2%-17%，同时填补了实时MILP基准测试和评估标准的空白。

Conclusion: POC框架为平衡MILP重求解性能与成本提供了系统解决方案，在多种场景下均表现出色，并为该领域提供了标准化的评估基准。

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an
optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data
platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time
operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization
problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when
to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem
poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and
solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial
samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP
structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly
applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing
literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth
objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework
called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which
systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when
deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the
relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test
our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show
that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side
benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP
benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Drift-Adapter是一个轻量级可学习转换层，通过将新查询映射到旧嵌入空间，避免生产向量数据库升级时重新编码整个语料库和重建ANN索引，显著降低操作中断和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生产向量数据库升级嵌入模型通常需要重新编码整个语料库和重建ANN索引，导致严重的操作中断和高昂计算成本。

Method: 设计了三种适配器参数化方法：正交Procrustes、低秩仿射和紧凑残差MLP，通过在少量新旧嵌入对样本上训练，将新查询映射到旧嵌入空间。

Result: 在MTEB文本语料和CLIP图像模型升级实验中，Drift-Adapter恢复了95-99%的检索召回率，查询延迟仅增加不到10微秒，相比完全重索引减少100倍以上的重计算成本。

Conclusion: Drift-Adapter是一种实用的敏捷模型部署解决方案，能够以接近零操作中断的方式实现模型升级，具有良好的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires
re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational
cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable
transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model
versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter
enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full
re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:
Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on
a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text
corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter
recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full
re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to
operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,
Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates
upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to
varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,
and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating
Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

TL;DR: 提出LoRAct方法，通过低秩激活压缩减少内存开销，在保持性能的同时比LoRA方法减少约80%的激活内存


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型发展，参数高效微调范式受到关注。虽然已有方法减少可训练参数数量，但其高内存开销仍是阻碍实际部署的关键瓶颈。研究发现模型激活是内存消耗的主要来源，特别是在大批量和长上下文长度下，但激活的秩始终保持较低

Method: 提出LoRAct方法，提供更灵活通用的压缩策略，可在前向传播过程中在线应用，无需任何校准数据。包含专门为低秩矩阵设计的新型基于采样的正交分解算法，相比广泛使用的RSVD具有更好的计算效率和更紧的误差界

Conclusion: LoRAct是一种内存高效的微调方法，通过低秩激活压缩有效解决了参数高效微调中的内存瓶颈问题

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant
attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods
have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their
substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders
practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations
constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch
sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains
consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient
fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior
work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that
can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any
calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based
orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices,
offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared
to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces
activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted
LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance. The source code is

Motivation: 研究群不变神经网络在对称函数学习中的统计优势，为编码对称性提供理论依据。

Method: 在Barron框架下分析群不变神经网络的逼近误差和Rademacher复杂度，引入群依赖因子δ来量化对称性带来的改进。

Result: 群不变结构引入δ≤1因子改进逼近率，且Rademacher复杂度不增加，从而显著降低泛化误差。提供了δ≈|G|^{-1}的有利情况和δ≈1的不利情况示例。

Conclusion: 编码群不变结构为对称目标函数带来明确的统计优势，为神经网络中的对称性编码提供了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks
within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating
group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor
is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation
accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity
of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant
counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the
incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve
significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We
further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous
theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in
neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target
functions.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在分布变化下往往性能下降，研究旨在探索仅依赖过去数据时模型是否能实现对未来数据的泛化。

Method: 探索了两种主要方法：参数插值（过去模型参数的凸组合）和参数外推（超出过去参数凸包的显式外推），并在多个时间任务上进行基准测试。

Result: 实证结果表明，在所有场景中，评估的方法都无法持续优于简单使用最新模型参数的基线方法。

Conclusion: 在没有未来数据访问或对数据生成过程的稳健假设时，这些结果强调了泛化和外推到未来数据的内在困难，需要对这类泛化声明保持谨慎态度。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time
series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of
research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing
data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework
that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting
on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there
is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process
susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct
supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves
away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time
series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a
novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a
unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to
learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values
while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts
accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in
https://github.com/Muyiiiii/CRIB.

Motivation: 随着新优化器的普及和模型量化成为高效部署的标准，需要系统研究优化器选择如何影响量化后的模型性能，填补优化器-量化交互研究的空白。

Method: 首先训练全精度模型建立基准，然后应用训练后量化评估性能退化，分析异常值相关指标的有效性，最后进行量化感知训练并比较不同优化器的表现。

Result: 发现异常值相关指标无法预测不同优化器的训练后量化性能；在量化感知训练中，Shampoo优化器显示出最低的精度退化，并达到最高的参数效率。

Conclusion: 优化器选择对量化模型性能有显著影响，Shampoo在量化感知训练中表现最优，为高效模型部署提供了重要指导。

Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for
efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer
affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in
both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains
limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model
robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization
(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision
models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore
the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply
PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different
optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio
(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different
optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only
isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and
propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized
models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We
find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not
remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest
accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware
training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest
parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

Motivation: 现有多模态生成模型在提取共享和私有信息时难以实现充分解耦，特别是在似然模型不足的挑战性数据集上表现不佳。

Method: 使用基于互信息的正则化方法：跨视图互信息最大化提取共享变量，循环一致性损失去除冗余，并引入扩散模型增强先验能力。

Result: IDMVAE在挑战性数据集上实现了共享和私有信息的清晰分离，展现出优越的生成质量和语义一致性。

Conclusion: 所提出的组件相互补充，IDMVAE相比现有方法在多模态表示学习方面表现更优。

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust
representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and
downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among
different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and
private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite
attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods
struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient.
In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to
explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based
regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for
extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy
removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models
to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are
complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a
clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior
generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

Motivation: 解决现有计算方法在抗生素耐药性预测中的局限性：标准机器学习模型忽略SNP的序列上下文，而Transformer等序列模型对中等规模数据集过于数据饥渴和计算昂贵。

Method: 开发轻量级自定义1D CNN高效学习SNP数据的预测序列模式，与XGBoost模型集成，结合序列感知和特征交互能力。

Result: 在809株E. coli菌株数据集上，对四种抗生素预测均取得顶级性能：CIP的MCC达0.926，GEN的Macro F1-score达0.691。模型能正确聚焦于fusA、parC等已知耐药基因中的SNP。

Conclusion: 融合序列感知1D CNN和基于特征的XGBoost模型创建了强大集成框架，克服了单独使用无序特征模型或序列模型的局限性。

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis.
While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes,
current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning
models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the
sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art
sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally
expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To
address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework
that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We
developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data.
This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful
gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature
interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of
809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying
class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier
performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro
F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also
show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes
like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for
resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a
feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the
limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束方法如PC在CI测试不完美时会产生级联错误，而现有LLM方法假设完美专家不现实。需要一种能过滤LLM幻觉并可靠传播边方向的方法。

Method: 从CI测试和LLM标注中提取高置信度种子，使用洗牌查询过滤LLM幻觉，采用置信度下降传播策略优先定向最可靠的边。

Result: 在多个真实世界图上，MosaCD在最终图构建中比现有约束方法获得更高准确率。

Conclusion: MosaCD通过改进初始种子的可靠性和鲁棒传播策略，显著提高了因果图构建的准确性。

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific
modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover
conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient
v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds,
assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets --
assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the
final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as
experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge
orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly
assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We
propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a
high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To
filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs'
positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel
confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges
first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across
multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph
construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the
improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

Motivation: 传统XAI方法在细节和可解释性之间存在权衡，而LRP的实现通常依赖启发式规则集，这些规则在清晰度和与模型行为对齐方面未经优化。

Method: 引入EVO-LRP方法，应用协方差矩阵自适应进化策略（CMA-ES）来基于定量可解释性指标（如忠实度或稀疏性）调整LRP超参数。

Result: EVO-LRP在可解释性指标性能和视觉一致性方面优于传统XAI方法，对类别特定特征表现出强敏感性。

Conclusion: 归因质量可以通过原则性的、任务特定的优化来系统性地改进。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多机器学习和科学计算任务涉及高维线性算子，只能通过昂贵的矩阵-向量乘积访问。现有方法只能构建低秩或对角近似，但实际算子可能同时包含这两种结构。

Method: 将SKETCHLORD建模为凸优化问题，开发可扩展算法同时估计低秩和对角分量。

Conclusion: SKETCHLORD是结构化近似工具包的有价值补充，特别适用于需要高保真近似的大规模算子，如深度学习Hessian矩阵。

Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve
high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector
products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the
construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few
matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but
approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work
introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank
*and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus*
Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant
(diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as
a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's
performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a
valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when
high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the
deep learning Hessian.

Conclusion: 该方法不仅解决了灾难性遗忘问题，还提供了在恒定内存约束下无需访问历史数据的持续学习方案。

Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes
at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to
address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular,
conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task
vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging
when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information.
Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model
within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies
per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task
interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available
optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit
old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation
discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing
overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints
without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard
class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable
and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

*Zekun Wang,Anant Gupta,Zihan Dong,Christopher J. MacLellan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对扩散模型的秩-1 EWC方法，结合重放机制解决持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限：重放方法需要强生成器且容易发生分布漂移，EWC假设任务间共享最优解且通常使用对角Fisher近似。扩散模型已能生成高质量重放数据，但其梯度几何特性未被充分研究

Method: 研究了扩散模型在低信噪比区域的梯度几何特性，发现每样本梯度高度共线，经验Fisher矩阵有效秩为1。基于此提出了秩-1 EWC变体，成本与对角近似相同但能捕捉主要曲率方向，并与重放方法结合

Result: 在类增量图像生成数据集（MNIST、FashionMNIST、CIFAR-10、ImageNet-1k）上，该方法持续改善平均FID并减少遗忘。在MNIST和FashionMNIST上几乎消除遗忘，在ImageNet-1k上遗忘减半

Conclusion: 扩散模型具有近似秩-1的Fisher矩阵，改进的Fisher估计使EWC成为重放方法的有效补充：重放促进任务间参数共享，EWC有效约束重放引起的漂移

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in
neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation
(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to
distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across
tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we
study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce
high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,
in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become
strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and
aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1
variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the
dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach
to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On
class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces
forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,
forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved
on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an
approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a
strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,
while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains,
yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across
datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple
linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant
deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of
linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of
characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free
setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and
explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel
independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the
noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads
to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence
of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need
for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two
complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank
reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank
Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel
adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a
noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our
theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several
settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical
theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust,
interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

<details>

Motivation: 图神经网络通常假设类别分布平衡，但在实际图数据中存在类别不平衡问题，导致模型对少数类学习偏差和性能下降，特别是合成节点质量不一致问题影响模型表现。

Method: 提出GraphIFE框架，结合图不变学习的两个关键概念，采用策略加强嵌入空间表示，提升模型识别不变特征的能力。

Result: 大量实验表明GraphIFE框架具有高效性和鲁棒泛化能力，在多个数据集上持续优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphIFE能够有效缓解图数据中的类别不平衡问题，通过解决合成节点质量不一致问题提升模型性能。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of
samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes
are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a
balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the
challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and
degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency
problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph
imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph
Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality
inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts
from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the
embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's
efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms
various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时空克里金法在训练评估设置中存在信息泄漏问题，2x2划分允许测试数据通过早停影响模型选择，无法真实反映分布外泛化特性。

Method: 采用3x3数据划分，提出DRIK方法：在节点层面扰动坐标捕捉连续空间关系，在边层面丢弃边减少信息流模糊性，在子图层面添加伪标签子图增强领域泛化。

Result: 在六个多样化时空数据集上，DRIK始终优于现有方法，MAE降低达12.48%，同时保持强可扩展性。

Conclusion: DRIK通过重新定义评估设置和设计分布鲁棒的增强策略，显著提升了时空克里金法的分布外泛化性能。

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with
sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often
suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test
data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true
OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a
3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets,
eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on
this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive
Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in
mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy
at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to
capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in
information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled
subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse
spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

Motivation: 现有异质图神经网络难以捕获长距离信息，需要堆叠多层导致计算复杂度高且出现过平滑问题，需要一种更高效的信息聚合方法。

Method: 引入虚拟节点作为辅助节点，与图中特定类型的所有节点相连，促进不同类型节点和边之间的长距离信息高效聚合。

Conclusion: VN-HGCN是一个通用框架，可无缝应用于其他HGNN模型，展示了其泛化能力，仅需4层即可实现有效的信息聚合。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful
performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from
various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models
often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking
numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational
complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a
Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which
leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the
graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a
specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range
information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual
nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information
aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can
serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN
models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the
effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: PNS方法成功解决了图神经网络中的随机性异常连接问题，提供了一种稳定有效的解决方案来处理类别不平衡和邻居分布异常问题。

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity
among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly
underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the
assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In
our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness
Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are
affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To
eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure
Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing
approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity
imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that
operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also
alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node
neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are
influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of
unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various
benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of
probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their
prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains
elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and
model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model
predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay
between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of
post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic
regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,
and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance
through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a
diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating
consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By
examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing
only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise
dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability
of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics
and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical
understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification. Code

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer的全局注意力机制计算成本高（二次复杂度），而等变模型虽然在某些任务中精度更高，但计算需求大，现有等变transformer只能支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口，限制了表达能力和性能。

Method: 采用Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，利用Clebsch-Gordon矩阵的稀疏性实现O(N log N)复杂度，并支持所有阶的等变特征建模，同时通过权重共享或数据增强实现可选的token置换等变性。

Conclusion: Clebsch-Gordan Transformer成功解决了等变transformer的计算效率和表达能力限制问题，为等变深度学习提供了更高效的全局注意力机制。

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

Conclusion: UAT能够有效解决传统早期退出策略的局限性，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率，并提供风险保证。

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing
prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs
and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an
intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined
threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the
model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to
distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model
trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that
adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework,
enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions
based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its
reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while
penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by
UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language
understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates
consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop
(<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 现有偏好对齐方法通常在紧凑的知识蒸馏模型上进行，但忽视了参考模型的分布召回特性，导致模型难以对齐稀有但期望的行为。

Method: 提出Align -> KD新流程：先在高召回参考模型上进行对齐，再进行知识蒸馏。通过理论分析、可控高斯混合实验和LLM实验验证。

Result: 传统KD -> Align流程导致模型奖励和目标精度显著降低，而Align -> KD流程能稳健对齐目标行为，获得更优的目标导向指标和更低方差。

Conclusion: 参考模型的召回能力是对齐的一阶设计选择，核心原则是：对齐必须先于蒸馏。

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact,
knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a
significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's
reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD ->
Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable
behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that
reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first
be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the
reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental
level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians
experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model
performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM
alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively
align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target
precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these
behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower
variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a
first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment
must precede distillation.

Conclusion: Hermes框架通过更有效地利用行业相关性，显著提升了股票时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing
essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and
analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series
exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve
forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only
capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two
key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag
interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among
industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series
forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by
eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and
multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more
flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a
hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding
window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider
lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model
multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message
passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the
consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock
datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: DIMIGNN通过解决邻居信息冗余和单一时间尺度依赖问题，有效提升了多变量时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance
of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their
capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may
lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction
typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To
tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN).
DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to
ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its
neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore,
a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust
the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the

TL;DR: 该论文提出了针对Mixture-of-Experts（MoE）模型的专用缩放定律，通过系统分解MoE设置，识别了5个关键影响因素，并通过446个实验构建了考虑所有必要因素的联合MoE缩放定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的密集模型缩放定律不适用于MoE模型，因为MoE模型存在影响因素多样性、复杂耦合关系和非单调性能影响等挑战，需要研究MoE特定的缩放定律。

Method: 系统分解MoE设置，识别5个关键因素（数据大小D、总模型大小N、激活模型大小Na、激活专家数G、共享专家比例S），设计446个受控实验来表征边际效应，构建联合MoE缩放定律。

Result: 发现G和S的最优设置与模型架构和数据大小无关；随着N的缩放，最优激活参数比例Na/N变得更稀疏；提出了准确且具有洞察力的MoE缩放定律。

Conclusion: 提出的MoE缩放定律可以作为未来MoE模型设计和训练的准确指导，解决了MoE模型特有的缩放挑战。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

Motivation: 离散变分自编码器中的离散随机变量无法进行精确可微分参数化，现有方法如Gumbel-Softmax重参数化或REINFORCE在高维任务中效果有限。

Method: 结合策略搜索技术，利用非参数编码器的自然梯度更新参数编码器，无需重参数化，并采用自动步长调整和基于transformer的编码器。

Conclusion: 所提出的训练框架能够有效处理离散VAE的高维重建任务，无需重参数化即可实现优异的性能。

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit
efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions,
enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However,
discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable
parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations,
such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient
estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that
have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image
reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a
training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a
non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring
reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation
and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as
ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and
quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional
data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for
ImageNet 256.

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its
ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data
distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and
cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most
existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may
not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce
interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly
applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group
formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a
decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish
dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new
knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized
models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective
cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance
gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of
the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition
relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and
model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We
also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution
algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various
baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

Motivation: 微调后的大语言模型在MLP层中编码了丰富的任务特定特征，但这些表征的形式和结构尚不清晰，需要研究神经元如何协同工作而非孤立运作。

Method: 采用联盟博弈论框架，将神经元视为享乐博弈中的智能体，使用top-responsive效用和PAC-Top-Cover算法提取稳定神经元联盟，并跟踪它们在层间的转变过程。

Result: 在LLaMA、Mistral和Pythia重排器上的应用表明，该方法发现的联盟比聚类基线具有更高的一致性，揭示了超越解缠结的高阶结构。

Conclusion: 享乐联盟通过揭示神经元如何合作编码特征，提供了功能重要、可解释且跨领域可预测的计算单元。

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features,
but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains
unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features
concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures
meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may
strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how
neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional
game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences
capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using
top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable
coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We
then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging,
or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR
tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than
clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features,
hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and
yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and
predictive across domains.

Motivation: 联邦学习适合医学影像应用，但面临扫描仪引起的领域偏移问题。现有方法要么需要直接比较跨站点数据（违反隐私约束），要么假设集中访问多站点数据（违反联邦学习保证）。

Method: 将领域对抗神经网络集成到联邦学习过程中，使用近端正则化方法稳定客户端间的对抗训练。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了联邦学习中领域偏移问题，实现了隐私保护的跨站点模型泛化。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or
clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical
imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is
scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or
acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most
harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across
sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)
offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations
without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized
access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets
these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial
Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive
federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method
that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted
3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on
participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79
y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15
sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization
over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

Method: 使用8种模型融合方法、7个数据集和6种攻击方法，在336个不同的攻击设置下进行综合评估和统计分析。

Result: 发现更强的模型融合方法反而增加对迁移攻击的脆弱性；减轻表示偏差会增加脆弱性；权重平均是最脆弱的融合方法。

Conclusion: 模型融合不能提供可靠的对抗鲁棒性，需要重新考虑在安全系统设计中使用模型融合的策略。

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task
learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to
tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across
tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,
particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored
its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box
adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully
mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial
examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis
consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336
distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion
of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably
defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success
rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners
regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM
methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating
representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight
averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM
method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this
increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our
findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing
MM.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)数量的增加，在有限公共数据的领域中，高效识别最佳模型进行下游微调变得越来越具有挑战性。

Method: TimeTic将观察到的模型-数据关系组织为上下文信息，利用表格基础模型作为上下文学习器，并引入基于模型层熵演化的新型模型表征方法。

Result: 在包含10个数据集、10个基础模型和3个预测任务的基准测试中，TimeTic的估计与实际微调性能高度一致，平均秩相关约为0.6，相比使用零样本性能作为可迁移性评分提高了30%。

Conclusion: TimeTic能够有效预测时间序列基础模型在未见数据集上的微调性能，为模型选择提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via
large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting
performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of
TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a
transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an
in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it
predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)
dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as
contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time
scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset
meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ
tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce
a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,
capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize
across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for
transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3
forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong
alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,
achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement
compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly
over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments,
many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major
challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is
their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient
methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient
formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its
martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed
algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies
in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to
existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of
control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

Abstract: Detecting payment fraud in real-world banking streams requires models that

We introduce FraudTransformer, a sequence model that augments a vanilla

absolute timestamps or inter-event values, and (ii) a learned positional

dataset -- tens of millions of transactions and auxiliary events -- show that
FraudTransformer surpasses four strong classical baselines (Logistic
Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as transformer ablations that omit
either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers
the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

Conclusion: SAFDNet具有稳健的预测性能和低噪声敏感性，适合实际临床应用。

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative
complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making
its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial
intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing
methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain
information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise
sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet
integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to
extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to
mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to
capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive
internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning,
outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust
predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for
practical clinical applications.

Conclusion: GBSK及其自适应版本AGBSK为大规模数据聚类提供了高效且实用的解决方案，显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and

Motivation: 符号音乐生成面临效率与质量的基本权衡：细粒度标记化能实现强连贯性但序列长复杂度高，而紧凑标记化提高效率但牺牲了标记内依赖关系。

Method: 采用基于延迟的调度机制（DP），将复合类标记在解码步骤中展开，使自回归模型能够建模标记内依赖关系，同时保持效率。该方法轻量级、无额外参数，可无缝集成到现有表示中。

Conclusion: 延迟调度机制是解决符号音乐生成中效率-质量权衡的有效方法，能够在不牺牲效率的情况下改善标记内依赖建模。

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency
and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long
sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency
at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a
delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across
decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies
while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that
introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show
that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and
narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

Conclusion: 批量归一化在深度强化学习中具有独特优势，通过MA-BN方法可以有效应对数据分布变化，提升训练效率和最终性能。

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep
learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling
more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data
and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning
process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains
unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and
its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to
evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final
performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use
of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how
different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify
failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying
causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with
practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL
pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates
and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances
exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty. Our code is available

but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

*Tomer D. Meirman,Bracha Shapira,Noa Dagan,Lior S. Rokach*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHAPoint是一个新颖的、任务无关的框架，将梯度提升树的预测准确性与基于点的风险评分的可解释性相结合，支持分类、回归和生存任务，具有灵活性高、预处理需求少、运行速度快等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的可解释风险评分方法依赖手动预处理、任务特定建模和简化假设，限制了其灵活性和预测能力。

Method: SHAPoint框架整合梯度提升树的预测能力和基于点的风险评分的可解释性，支持多种任务类型，继承树模型的优点如缺失数据处理和单调约束支持。

Result: 实证结果显示SHAPoint产生紧凑且可解释的评分，预测性能与最先进方法相当，但运行时间大幅减少。

Conclusion: SHAPoint是透明和可扩展风险分层的强大工具，提供卓越的灵活性、减少的预处理依赖和更快的运行性能。

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet
traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual
preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit
their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel,
task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient
boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint
supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting
valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing
data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks,
SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing,
and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces
compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a
powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs知识的结构组织，受认知神经科学启发，研究知识同质性模式，即相关实体在知识掌握程度上具有相似性。

Method: 将LLM知识映射为图表示，分析实体与其邻居的知识关系，提出GNN回归模型预测实体级知识得分，优先检查知识较少的triplets。

Result: 发现LLMs对图中位置相近的实体具有相似的知识掌握程度，基于同质性原则的GNN模型能有效估计知识得分。

Conclusion: 知识同质性原则可用于优化知识注入和多跳推理问答，在相同标注预算下最大化知识覆盖。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba作为Transformer的高效替代品，在长序列建模中表现出色，但其上下文学习的理论机制尚不明确，限制了对其底层原理的深入理解。

Method: 通过开发针对Mamba结构的非凸优化新技术，分析其在线性回归任务中的训练动态，建立指数收敛率并推导损失边界。

Result: 证明了Mamba能够以指数收敛率达到上下文学习解，损失边界与Transformer相当，并揭示了其通过在线梯度下降学习潜在函数的机制。

Conclusion: Mamba通过不同于Transformer的在线梯度下降机制实现上下文学习，这一理论发现通过实验模拟得到验证。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient
Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling.
Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large
foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains
limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even
fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard
theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in
the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of
Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques
tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's
structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and
derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our
results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient
descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different
from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through
gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by
experimental simulation.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了Visual CoT在视觉扰动下的鲁棒性，发现虽然Visual CoT能提升准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感。作者提出了一种基于Grounding DINO的插件式增强方法来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Visual CoT技术通过整合视觉编辑显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力，但其在图像级噪声下的鲁棒性尚未被探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了涵盖12种图像损坏类型和4个VQA数据集的基准测试，比较使用和不使用Visual CoT的VLM性能。提出将Grounding DINO模型集成到Visual CoT流程中，提供高置信度的局部视觉线索来稳定推理。

Result: Visual CoT在所有情况下都能提升绝对准确率，但对输入扰动更敏感，性能下降更明显。分析表明编辑后的图像块是脆弱性的主要来源。

Conclusion: 揭示了Visual CoT的脆弱性模式，并提出了一种有效的、架构无关的解决方案来增强视觉鲁棒性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates
explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into
the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the
robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains
unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual
CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image
corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a
comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do
not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves
absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted
by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,
resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through
extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual
CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.
Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement
method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,
providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work
reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective,
architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

TL;DR: 提出SAE-RSV方法，利用稀疏自编码器从有限数据中精炼控制向量，通过语义去噪和特征增强来提升大语言模型的控制效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有控制方法依赖大规模数据集来学习清晰的行为信息，限制了在现实场景中的应用。从小数据集提取的控制向量往往包含任务无关的噪声特征，影响其有效性。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器对控制向量进行语义去噪和增强：首先根据SAE提供的语义移除任务无关特征，然后通过语义相似性丰富任务相关特征。

Result: 大量实验表明SAE-RSV显著优于所有基线方法，包括监督微调。

Conclusion: 通过SAEs精炼原始控制向量，可以从有限训练数据构建有效的控制向量。

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language
models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing
steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral
information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The
steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant
noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering
vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector
via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise
and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove
task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and
then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their
semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the
baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that
effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by
refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

TL;DR: 提出STAIR方法解决多阶段任务中偏好强化学习的阶段错位问题，通过时间距离学习阶段近似，优先比较同阶段片段，提升策略学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多阶段任务中，比较不同阶段的片段（如移动vs操作）会产生无意义的反馈，阻碍策略学习，需要解决阶段错位问题。

Method: STAIR方法：基于时间距离学习阶段近似，通过对比学习将时间相近的状态分组到连贯阶段，无需预定义任务知识，动态适应策略变化，优先同阶段比较。

Result: 实验证明STAIR在多阶段任务中表现优越，在单阶段任务中也有竞争力，人类研究表明STAIR近似的阶段与人类认知一致。

Conclusion: STAIR有效缓解了多阶段任务中的阶段错位问题，提升了偏好强化学习的性能，且学习到的阶段与人类认知相符。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward
engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling
better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in
multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,
navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments
from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in
uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we
validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and
empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward
learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal
distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance
is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into
coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to
policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in
multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.
Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are
consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating
stage misalignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视强化学习中探索-利用权衡的传统观点，认为这种权衡可能是测量层面的伪象而非根本约束，旨在发现同时增强探索和利用能力的机会。

Method: 提出Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL)方法，通过有效秩及其导数来量化探索和利用动态，利用理论上稳定的ERA作为预测元控制器，创建双通道激励结构来直接塑造RL优势函数。

Result: 在多样化LLM和推理基准测试中显示出一致的性能提升，在具有挑战性的Gaokao 2024数据集上实现了高达21.4%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 在隐藏状态层面探索和利用可以解耦，这为同时增强两种能力提供了机会，VERL方法成功实现了探索-利用的协同增强，超越了传统的权衡范式。

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

TL;DR: Tequila是一种无陷井的三元量化优化方法，通过将死区陷井权重重新用作动态偏置，解决了三元权重量化中的死区陷井问题，在几乎零推理开销的情况下显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决三元权重量化中由于死区陷井导致的显著精度下降问题，传统方法依赖缺乏硬件支持的混合精度乘法或需要大量数据的量化感知训练。

Method: 提出Tequila方法，重新激活死区陷井权重作为动态偏置，使这些权重在前向传播中提供连续信号，在反向传播中接收直接有意义的梯度信号。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于最先进的三元量化方法，在ARC基准上获得>4%的准确率提升，接近全精度性能（差距<1%），推理速度提升3.0倍。

Conclusion: Tequila为在资源受限环境中部署先进大语言模型提供了高度实用和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on
mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it
not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining
weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with
hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to
significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training
with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large
number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because
these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable
escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.
To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization
optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing
them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a
continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,
meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model
capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC
benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly
matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference
speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient
implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained
environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

TL;DR: IndexNet是一个基于MLP的多变量时间序列预测框架，通过索引嵌入模块（包含时间戳嵌入和通道嵌入）来利用描述性信息，提升长期周期模式捕获能力并避免变量同质化预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多忽略了时间戳和变量索引等描述性信息，这些信息包含丰富的上下文语义。为了挖掘这些信息的潜力并利用MLP架构轻量且强大的周期捕获能力。

Method: 提出IndexNet框架，包含索引嵌入模块：时间戳嵌入将时间戳转换为嵌入向量注入输入序列；通道嵌入为每个变量分配可训练的身份嵌入，使模型能明确区分异质变量。

Result: 在12个多样化真实数据集上的实验表明，IndexNet在主流基线上达到可比性能，验证了时间感知和变量感知设计的有效性。插件实验和可视化分析显示其具有强泛化性和可解释性。

Conclusion: IndexNet通过有效利用描述性信息，在多变量时间序列预测中展现出优越性能，同时解决了当前研究中泛化性和可解释性不足的问题。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow
forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling
of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods
overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable
indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such
information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture
ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework
augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two
key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE).
Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them
into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture
long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a
unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model
to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized
predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable
performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and
visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality
and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF
research.

Motivation: 由于动态图数据分布随时间演变，训练好的DGNN在部署时面对未见测试图时存在性能不确定性，需要评估模型是否适合在特定测试图上进行推理。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：(1)测试时动态图模拟，捕捉训练-测试分布差异作为监督信号；(2)DyGEval开发与训练，准确估计DGNN在测试时动态图上的性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，DyGEval在各种DGNN骨干网络和不同分布偏移的动态图上都能作为有效的评估器。

Conclusion: DyGEval为解决动态图神经网络模型评估问题提供了有效解决方案，能够准确评估模型在分布偏移下的性能表现。

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for
learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world
systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph
data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant
performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in
practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed
DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is
suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we
introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess
the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by
estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed
DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage
framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the
training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an
evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates
the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an
effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different
dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

Motivation: 大多数生成模型预测原子坐标时忽略了晶体对称性约束，导致生成的晶体对称性有限且不现实。需要开发能够生成符合空间群对称性约束的晶体结构的方法。

Method: 使用空间群条件流匹配框架，定义条件对称噪声基分布和群条件等变向量场，将原子运动限制在其初始Wyckoff位置，并通过高效的群平均实现对称性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效生成符合晶体学对称性约束的高度对称晶体结构，计算开销可忽略，在晶体生成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in
three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry
operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in
specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an
atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its
Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates
overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high
populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce
Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that
samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,
stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process
on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a
conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,
equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to
their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is
achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored
for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of
symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on
crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform
relevant ablations.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete
$\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for
data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering
theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a
circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We
interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a
circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A
neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the
probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target,
we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit
pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees
transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to
illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

Motivation: 标准MoE架构的确定性路由机制存在脆弱性，导致模型校准不良和过度自信，系统无法识别自身知识的局限性。

Method: 系统研究了三种在路由管道不同阶段引入不确定性方法：权重空间、对数空间和选择空间，构建贝叶斯MoE路由框架。

Result: 在30亿参数MoE模型上的实验表明，该框架显著提高了路由稳定性、分布内校准和分布外检测能力。

Conclusion: 通过改进核心架构组件，为构建更鲁棒和自感知的大语言模型提供了实用且计算可行的路径。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive
yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic
routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness
is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in
systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured
\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single,
deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution
over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families
of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of
the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space},
and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE
model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing
stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD)
detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural
component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work
provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building
more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know
what they don't know.

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have
recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate
full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of
step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample
from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage
conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in
environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce
Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides
the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training,
effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results
across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and
performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

TL;DR: DART是一个用于GUI智能体的解耦强化学习训练框架，通过异步模块设计解决了多轮交互缓慢和训练数据不足的问题，在OSWorld基准测试中取得了42.13%的任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉语言模型的GUI智能体在自动化桌面和移动任务方面具有潜力，但面临强化学习应用的两大挑战：与GUI环境的多轮交互速度慢，以及用于策略学习的高质量智能体-环境交互数据不足。

Method: 提出DART解耦智能体强化学习训练框架，将训练系统分为四个异步模块：环境集群、回滚服务、数据管理器和训练器。采用自适应数据管理方案，包括预收集成功轨迹、动态调整回滚参数、选择性训练高熵步骤，以及使用截断重要性采样来稳定学习。

Result: DART显著提高了系统效率：1.6倍GPU利用率用于回滚，1.9倍训练吞吐量，5.5倍环境利用率。在OSWorld基准测试中，DART-GUI-7B实现了42.13%的任务成功率，比基础模型提高了14.61%，比开源SOTA高出7.34%。

Conclusion: DART框架通过解耦设计和自适应数据管理，有效解决了GUI智能体强化学习训练中的效率和数据质量问题，为开源智能体强化学习训练社区提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

### [514] [Towards Understanding Subliminal Learning: When and How Hidden Biases Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23886)
*Simon Schrodi,Elias Kempf,Fazl Barez,Thomas Brox*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 语言模型在蒸馏过程中可以传递隐藏偏见，这种现象称为潜意识学习。研究发现潜意识学习不需要全局标记纠缠或logit泄漏，而是由一小部分分歧标记驱动，这些标记在教师模型有不同偏见时会预测不同的标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型蒸馏过程中隐藏偏见传递的机制，特别是为什么在硬蒸馏（学生只看到采样标记）的情况下也会发生潜意识学习。

Method: 通过控制实验和机制分析，识别分歧标记的作用，并通过掩码这些标记来验证其重要性。还研究了不同层对潜意识学习的影响。

Result: 发现分歧标记是潜意识学习的关键，掩码这些标记可以基本消除隐藏偏见传递。早期层对潜意识学习至关重要，即使只微调单个早期层也足以实现潜意识学习。

Conclusion: 潜意识学习是脆弱的，即使像改写提示这样的小变化通常也足以抑制它。分歧标记机制解释了偏见如何在蒸馏过程中传递。

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example,
a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the
training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is
called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft
distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token
distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where
the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how
does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through
controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that
subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.
Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where
teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out
these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,
divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,
finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal
learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small
changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习理论面临的关键挑战是解释基于梯度的优化方法在训练大规模复杂深度神经网络时的显著成功。虽然已经为少数特定架构证明了线性收敛，但仍缺乏统一的理论。

Method: 提出了一个统一证明，适用于任何具有分段非零多项式激活函数或ReLU、sigmoid激活函数的神经网络，重点关注连续梯度下降（梯度流）方法。

Result: 建立了一个通用定理，不仅覆盖了先前未知的架构，还在更弱的假设下整合了现有结果。理论预测与实用步长梯度下降方法的经验结果高度一致。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度神经网络训练中的梯度优化方法提供了一个统一的理论基础，证明了在无穷小步长极限下的线性收敛特性。

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable
success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale,
complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has
been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still
evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear
convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while
training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or
ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general
theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously
unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While
our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal
step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the
predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent
method.

TL;DR: 提出动态正交持续微调方法，通过追踪功能方向漂移并动态更新，解决大语言模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有正则化方法在长期LLM持续学习中失败的主要原因是微调过程中功能方向的漂移

Method: DOC方法追踪功能方向漂移并动态更新，同时调整新任务参数的梯度使其与历史功能方向正交

Result: 在多个LLM持续学习基准测试中优于现有方法，有效减少灾难性遗忘

Conclusion: DOC方法为持续LLM微调提供了鲁棒工具，通过正交化梯度缓解新旧任务间的干扰

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出D-Gating方法，通过完全可微的结构化过参数化实现结构化稀疏，理论证明其与L2,2/D正则化等价，并在多个任务中优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构化稀疏正则化能有效压缩神经网络，但其不可微性导致与随机梯度下降不兼容，需要专门优化器或后处理剪枝，缺乏理论保证。

Method: D-Gating方法将每组权重分解为主权重向量和多个标量门控因子，实现完全可微的结构化过参数化。

Result: 理论证明D-Gating的局部最小值也是L2,2/D正则化的局部最小值，梯度流极限下以指数速度收敛。在视觉、语言和表格任务中均优于直接优化和传统剪枝方法。

Conclusion: D-Gating在理论上等价于解决原始组稀疏问题，但诱导了从非稀疏到稀疏优化的独特学习动态，实现了优异的性能-稀疏度权衡。

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理稀疏时间序列数据时缺乏可解释性，需要一种既能保持高性能又能提供可操作解释的框架。

Method: 将每个时间依赖轨迹表示为有向图，应用增强的图神经加法网络，允许用户通过特征和图的组合来控制可解释性与表达力之间的权衡。

Result: 在包括血液检测死亡率预测和假新闻检测在内的真实数据集上，GMAN优于强大的非可解释黑盒基线方法。

Conclusion: GMAN在保持高性能的同时提供了与领域对齐的可操作解释，证明了其在稀疏时间序列数据分析中的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that
extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse
time-series data. GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed
graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows
users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping
features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and
graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality
prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong
non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable,
domain-aligned explanations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiViS是一种针对视觉语言模型(VLM)的推测解码加速方法，通过显式-隐式输入分解框架，将视觉令牌从草稿器输入中移除，仅保留文本令牌作为显式输入，同时重用目标VLM的隐藏状态作为隐式视觉信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码在加速大型语言模型推理方面很有效，但应用于视觉语言模型时面临挑战：视觉令牌导致草稿器和目标VLM语义表示不匹配，以及大量视觉令牌降低草稿器自注意力计算效率。

Method: 提出显式-隐式输入分解框架，移除草稿器输入中的视觉令牌，仅保留文本令牌；采用多步自反馈训练策略，通过动态数据选择和序列嵌入监督来模拟推理过程。

Result: 将草稿器的预填充序列长度压缩至目标VLM输入的0.7%-1.3%，同时保持无损生成质量；在多种模型和任务上实现了最高2.65倍的加速。

Conclusion: HiViS通过有效处理视觉令牌问题，成功将推测解码技术应用于视觉语言模型，显著加速了VLM推理过程。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in
Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models
(VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs.
First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from
different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target
VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the
KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens
substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding
stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative
Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input
decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual
tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as
explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding
last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional
processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step
self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential
embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach
compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the
target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive
experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup,
confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

Motivation: 当前MoE架构研究过于关注性能表现，缺乏对其内部机制的理解，这限制了该领域的进一步发展。

Method: 使用内部指标MUI，明确纳入路由机制并分析专家级行为，系统分析多种公开可用的MoE模型。

Result: 发现神经元利用率随模型演进下降反映更强泛化能力；训练动态轨迹中基准性能信号有限而MUI揭示更深层洞察；任务完成依赖多专家协作，共享专家驱动集中；神经元激活模式可作为数据多样性的细粒度代理。

Conclusion: MUI可作为基准性能的补充指标，为MoE模型的容量、动态和专业化提供新见解。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

Result: 发现条件扩散模型存储的额外信息等于X和Y之间的互信息，分类器自由引导能有效提升采样时的互信息，这对图像模型特别重要。

Conclusion: 扩散模型与凯利准则存在深刻联系，分类器自由引导通过增强互信息改善生成质量，同时指出了将扩散模型视为无限深度自编码器的观点存在细微差别。

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for
maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models
store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning
information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free
guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at
sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual
information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately
connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the
popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In
doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum
mechanics.

Result: CorText能够仅基于神经数据生成准确的图像描述，并比对照组更好地回答详细问题，同时展示了零样本泛化能力，超越了训练时看到的语义类别。

Conclusion: 这项研究标志着从被动解码向生成性、灵活的大脑活动与语言接口的转变，为脑机交互开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction,
and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a
shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static,
non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates
neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended,
natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded
during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and
can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to
neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization
beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a
counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation.
These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible
interfaces between brain activity and language.

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模地理空间分析提供了一个实用的解决方案，能够有效处理极大数据集的空间相似性计算问题。

Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve
the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more
scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these
optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations
required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of
clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on
these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,
supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently
identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting
user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine
learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial
reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental
results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a
practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

Conclusion: E²C框架通过分离规划与执行，实现了高效推理、强泛化能力和更好的可解释性，显著降低了自一致性开销。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

Motivation: 传统多任务学习方法通过加权平均组合任务损失或梯度，但任务损失的非仿射缩放会导致某些任务主导训练，降低整体性能。

Method: 采用DiBS（方向性讨价还价解决方案）方法，提出DiBS-MTL算法，在非凸多任务学习设置下实现高效计算。

Conclusion: DiBS-MTL能够有效解决多任务学习中的任务主导问题，提供对任务损失缩放不变的帕累托稳定解。

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine
different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These
methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require
access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central
challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled
relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade
overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the
Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions
immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task
loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex
MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under
standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto
stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,
a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we
validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it
achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that
significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior
bargaining-inspired MTL methods. Code available at

Motivation: 针对Chinchilla缩放定律存在的争议（宽置信区间、方法间差异、与其他缩放定律不一致），验证其作为语言模型缩放指导的可靠性。

Method: 分析Chinchilla模型参数的不同解释方式（三种可能），并系统性地扰动模型参数来测试关键结果的敏感性。

Result: 发现模型参数的不同解释对关键结果影响不大，缩放定律估计和计算最优的token-参数比率保持稳定；对加性或系统性误差最敏感，但总体能承受显著扰动。

Conclusion: Chinchilla的缩放定律仍然是语言模型缩放的可信指导，为领域提供了更新的信心。

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of
compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language
models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been
raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches,
and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for
the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work
demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model
parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three
interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different
interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not
meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the
compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,
the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute
budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have
been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing
model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results
are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the
otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,
Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our
findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide
for scaling language models.

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融衍生品智能合约自动化能带来显著效率提升，但将金融规范转化为gas高效可执行代码的复杂性限制了其实际应用，特别是从高级规范生成功能正确且经济可行的代码仍是一个重大挑战。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，使用PPO代理从预定义库中选择最优代码片段，通过两阶段课程学习先训练功能正确性再转向gas优化。

Conclusion: 这项工作为自动合成可靠且经济可持续的智能合约提供了可行方法，弥合了高级金融协议与高效链上执行之间的差距。

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial
efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity
of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In
particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically
viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart
contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a
pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum
first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to
gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate
contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to
35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work
presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and
economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level
financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了GUIDE框架，通过集成LLM生成的邻接矩阵与观测数据，解决了现有因果发现方法在可扩展性、计算效率和混合数据类型适应性方面的关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代因果发现方法在可扩展性、计算效率和混合数据类型适应性方面存在关键限制，传统算法如PC、GES和ICA-LiNGAM在处理高阶节点时面临计算成本过高和可扩展性差的问题。

Method: GUIDE框架采用双编码器架构，将LLM生成的邻接矩阵与观测数据集成，通过强化学习代理在训练过程中动态平衡奖励最大化（准确性）和惩罚避免（DAG约束）。

Result: GUIDE显著优化计算效率，相比RL-BIC和KCRL方法平均减少约42%的运行时间，同时在准确性上比NOTEARS和GraN-DAG平均提高约117%，并能扩展到≥70个节点的场景。

Conclusion: GUIDE在混合数据类型和可扩展性方面表现出鲁棒性能，在基线方法失败的≥70节点设置中仍能有效工作。

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by
benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational
energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional
algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges,
exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability
beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large
Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data
through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational
efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and
KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy
over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's
reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization
(accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance
across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where
baseline methods fail.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了弱到强泛化中的关键问题：在存在虚假相关性的下游任务中，使用弱教师生成的伪标签微调强预训练学生模型时，弱到强泛化是否发生以及如何改进失败情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在存在群体不平衡导致的虚假相关性情况下，弱到强泛化的表现和失败机制，特别是当标记数据和无标记数据的少数群体比例不同时。

Method: 理论分析在比例渐近极限下的弱到强增益，并通过大量实验验证理论结果。提出一种简单有效的算法补救措施：在弱到强微调后，在强学生模型的高置信度数据子集上重新训练。

Result: 理论表明当无标记数据和标记数据的少数群体比例相同时，弱到强泛化总能发生；但当比例不同时，弱到强泛化可能失败，且增益随比例差异的平方而减小。提出的算法在多个虚假相关性基准和师生对上取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化在群体不平衡情况下可能失败，但通过在高置信度数据子集上重新训练可以有效提升性能，该方法无需群体标签且效果稳定。

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in
weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained
student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with
spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We
consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a
weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group
of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set
pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$.
Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional
asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels
when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S
gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is
corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation
benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures,
we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the
strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our
algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements
over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出SLA（稀疏线性注意力）方法，通过融合稀疏和线性注意力来加速扩散模型中的注意力计算，将注意力权重分为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用O(N²)、O(N)计算或跳过，实现20倍注意力计算减少且不损失生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在扩散变换器（DiT）模型中，特别是视频生成场景下，注意力延迟是主要瓶颈，因为序列长度长且注意力具有二次复杂度。研究发现注意力权重可以分为两部分：少量高秩的大权重和大量低秩的小权重。

Method: 提出SLA方法，将注意力权重分类为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用O(N²)注意力、O(N)线性注意力和跳过计算。将这些计算融合到单个GPU内核中，支持前向和后向传播。

Result: SLA将注意力计算减少95%，在Wan2.1-1.3B模型上实现13.7倍注意力计算加速和2.2倍端到端视频生成加速，且不降低生成质量。

Conclusion: SLA通过融合稀疏和线性注意力，有效解决了DiT模型中注意力计算瓶颈，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种不同的预训练缩放定律来预测生成式评估中的pass-at-k性能，并研究了这些缩放定律在不同k值下的稳定性和预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注判别式评估的缩放定律，而生成式评估（如数学问题解决、软件工程）的缩放定律研究相对较少。本文旨在填补这一空白，为生成式性能预测提供方法论。

Method: 提出了三种预训练缩放定律：(1) 基于计算量的缩放定律，(2) 基于模型参数和训练token的缩放定律，(3) 基于黄金参考解对数似然的缩放定律。通过实验评估这些方法在不同k值下的表现。

Result: 研究发现：计算量和参数+token的缩放定律在最后1.5-2.5个数量级稳定，而黄金参考似然缩放定律在最后5个数量级稳定；三种缩放定律预测性能相当，但计算量定律在小k时稍差，黄金参考似然在大k时稍差。

Conclusion: 建立了计算量缩放定律作为参数和token缩放定律的计算最优包络的理论连接，为研究人员提供了预测生成式性能的框架和方法论。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning,
driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute.
While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting
performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as
multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done
on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations
such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and
evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on
generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive
model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in
the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log
likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1)
We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting,
$k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the
predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find
that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize
for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference
likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In
terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform
comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small
$k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse
for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute
scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the
parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and
practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative
performance.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过让设备端LLM自主决策路由，有效解决了设备-云协作中的路由问题，实现了更好的性能平衡。

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying
large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device
inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential
problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled
locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on
external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to
determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing
decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled
through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization
problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem
solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we
develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level
policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the
reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on
cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that
the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and
significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

Result: 发现CAVs的方差随随机样本数量N以1/N的速率减小，这是一个普适性结果。

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make
models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A
promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level
concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of
methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one
of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their
computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the
actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness
of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis
of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results,
confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an
universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the
number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for
a resource-efficient application of the method.

Result: 在厨房任务中性能提升高达16.4%，在Gym和Adroit任务中分别提升8.6%和6.3%。

Conclusion: ICQL展示了上下文学习在鲁棒和组合价值估计中的潜力，为离线RL提供了原则性有效框架。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline
reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single
global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks
involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning
(\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a
contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer
local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.
Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of
the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved
context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and
supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL}
substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance
in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\%
and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context
learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning
\texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'',
``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been
used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different
aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth}
explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon
principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data,
probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like
importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast
SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based
architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting
practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the
supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated
attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and
destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like''
use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to
later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy
choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to
investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships
essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

Method: 使用Awair HOME监测器在摩洛哥水产养殖设施中每5分钟采样，记录6个IEQ变量，采用ISO标准安装高度，并进行质量控制。

Result: 产生了23,000多个时间戳观测数据，显示稳定环境条件（中位数CO2=758 ppm；PM2.5=12微克/立方米）和明显的投喂时间峰值。

Conclusion: AQUAIR填补了智能水产养殖信息学的关键空白，为数据驱动的机器学习课程和环境传感研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive
feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach
for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to
produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with
contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four
types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the
matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the
nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture
density.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains
to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these
algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions
of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of
ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is
\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or
outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness
often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many
high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of
research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group
of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer
the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various
sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic
information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we
relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic
fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a
group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set
of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we
conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the
baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled
classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed
method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PEARL是一个基于设备端LLM的D2D通信协作跨层优化框架，通过利用发布者和订阅者状态来指导Wi-Fi Aware参数选择，在合作低电量情况下可降低16%能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展单设备端LLM范式，利用对等设备状态信息进行更智能的无线参数优化，解决传统启发式方法在动态环境中的局限性。

Method: 采用上下文感知奖励（基于应用延迟容忍度和设备电池状态）进行KL微调，提出PEARL（Head+LoRA）和PEARL-Lite（仅Head）两种轻量变体。

Result: PEARL在合成场景中优于启发式和紧凑模型基线，PEARL-Lite实现亚20ms推理延迟且性能接近，在合作低电量情况下能耗降低达16%。

Conclusion: 对等感知上下文、奖励对齐训练和基于头部的效率使LLM适用于始终在线的设备端跨层控制。

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a
framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,
PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states
to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which
normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device
battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study
two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves
the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms
inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios
grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic
and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative
low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context,
reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for
always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

Motivation: 点缺陷在材料性质中起核心作用，但第一性原理方法计算成本高。现有基于图神经网络的机器学习力场存在过平滑和长程相互作用表示不佳的问题，特别是在点缺陷建模中。

Method: ADAPT用直接坐标空间表示替代图表示，显式考虑所有原子对相互作用，将原子视为token，使用Transformer编码器建模其相互作用。

Conclusion: ADAPT通过Transformer架构有效解决了GNN在点缺陷建模中的局限性，为加速缺陷结构弛豫提供了更高效准确的替代方案。

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials.
First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and
structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However,
these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force
fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural
relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range
interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling
point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep
Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph
representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly
considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a
Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of
silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both
force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based
model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

TL;DR: GeoFunFlow是一个用于复杂几何形状上逆问题的几何扩散模型框架，结合了几何函数自编码器和潜在扩散模型，在五个基准测试中实现了最先进的重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏微分方程控制的逆问题在科学和工程中至关重要，但由于不适定性、数据稀疏性和不规则几何形状的复杂性而具有挑战性。传统方法计算成本高，而现有学习方法大多针对规则域或前向建模。

Method: GeoFunFlow结合了新颖的几何函数自编码器(GeoFAE)和通过整流流训练的潜在扩散模型。GeoFAE使用Perceiver模块处理不同大小的非结构化网格，产生物理场的连续重建，而扩散模型能够从稀疏和噪声数据中进行后验采样。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，GeoFunFlow在复杂几何形状上实现了最先进的重建精度，提供了校准的不确定性量化，并且相比算子学习和扩散模型基线具有更高的推理效率。

Conclusion: GeoFunFlow为复杂几何形状上的逆问题提供了一个有效的框架，结合了几何感知编码和扩散建模的优势，实现了准确、高效且可量化的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to
ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.
Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive,
especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based
approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for
regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em
GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on
complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder
(GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE
employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and
produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion
model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five
benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over
complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and
delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了HyMaTE模型，结合状态空间模型和Transformer注意力机制，用于电子健康记录表示学习，解决了传统模型处理长序列的效率和复杂度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录数据具有长序列、多变量、稀疏和缺失值等复杂特性，传统深度学习模型难以有效处理。Transformer模型虽然成功但计算复杂度高且上下文长度有限，而状态空间模型虽然效率高但主要关注序列级信息而非通道级数据。

Method: 提出HyMaTE混合模型，将状态空间模型与先进注意力机制相结合，专门为纵向数据表示设计。通过状态空间模型实现线性时间序列建模，结合注意力机制增强表示能力。

Result: 在多个临床数据集上的预测任务测试表明，HyMaTE能够捕获更有效、更丰富和更细致的统一EHR数据表示。自注意力机制的结果可解释性证明了模型的有效性。

Conclusion: HyMaTE作为一个可扩展和通用的解决方案，适用于现实世界的医疗应用，在EHR表示学习方面表现出色。

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day
healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient
health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate
sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in
traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have
demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes,
their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder
their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space
Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time
sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but
focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level
data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and
Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model
tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs
with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on
multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an
effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data.
Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention
illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable
solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at:

TL;DR: 提出了Echo Flow Networks (EFNs)框架，通过扩展的Echo State Networks和创新的激活函数，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了时间序列预测性能，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列预测中长程依赖关系建模的计算复杂性和信息保留之间的权衡问题，同时克服传统Echo State Networks表达能力有限的问题。

Method: 使用扩展的Echo State Networks (X-ESNs)和MLP读出器，引入Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA)实现复杂的时间动态，采用双流架构动态选择特征。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，EFNs相比PatchTST等方法训练速度提升4倍，模型大小减少3倍，预测误差从43%降至35%，相对改进20%。EchoFormer在所有数据集上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EFNs框架成功平衡了计算效率和表达能力，为长序列时间序列预测提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge:
how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought
notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between
computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information
over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have
recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant
memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This
makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event
history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art
performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both
their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of
extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel
Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex,
neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's
representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In
addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history
dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon
memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to
4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like
PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative
improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh,
ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning
in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that
permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original
(``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness
property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval,
multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an
impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer
cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of
decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample
complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse
permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental
role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity
of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture.
The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input
with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation
learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative
mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate
``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when
these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of
intermediate computations).

Result: 在多个模拟和真实数据集上验证了理论，包括Salinas和Indian Pines高光谱数据集以及文档数据集。

Conclusion: 局部核技术能够有效分离不同概率分布的支持集，为分类问题提供了新的理论框架和实用算法。

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached
in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in
theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a
minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation
problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the
various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized
kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to
separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical
manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class
boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life
datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a
document dataset.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于机器学习的台风轨迹和状态预测方法，使用梯度提升回归和随机森林分类器，在准确率、精确度、召回率和F1分数方面表现优异，为传统天气预报提供了有效的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报模型计算密集且容易出错，需要开发更高效准确的台风预测方法来减少生命损失、基础设施损坏和经济中断。

Result: 经过超参数调整和SMOTE处理后，随机森林分类器达到93%的最高准确率，在精确度、召回率和F1分数上均优于支持向量机和多层感知器。回归结果误差较低，气压和风速预测误差分别约为2.2 mb和2.4 kt。

Conclusion: 机器学习模型，特别是基于集成的分类器，为传统预测方法提供了有效、可扩展的替代方案，具有实时台风预测和集成到决策支持系统中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life,
infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather
prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to
error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a
machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and
status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including
recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a
regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum
pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of
historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to
predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and
three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and
synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest
performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision,
recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying
minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results
yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about
2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models,
especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative
to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone
prediction and integration into decision support systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型遗忘方法不稳定且不可靠，梯度差异方法结合交叉熵损失会导致权重和梯度无界增长，造成训练不稳定并影响遗忘和保留效果。

Method: 提出有界参数高效遗忘方法，在LoRA微调中应用有界函数到MLP适配器，控制权重动态，使梯度差异方法能够可靠收敛。

Result: 在TOFU、TDEC和MUSE基准测试中，从125M到8B参数的不同架构和规模上，该方法在遗忘方面取得显著改进，同时保持了保留效果。

Conclusion: 建立了一个理论上有基础、实践中可扩展的LLM遗忘框架，解决了梯度差异方法的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy
and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A
widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent
on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data
whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy
loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading
to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide
a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how
ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP
layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient
Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based
fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple
modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient
difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE
benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our
method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving
retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable
framework for unlearning in LLMs.

Motivation: 现有自编码器方法通常分别关注全局或局部几何特性，全局方法存在距离近似误差累积问题，局部方法容易收敛到扭曲大规模关系的次优解。

Method: 采用非对称架构设计，在编码器上施加全局距离约束，在解码器上施加局部几何约束，通过理论分析证明这种设计与编码器-解码器不同角色的自然对齐。

Result: 在合成流形和真实数据集上的综合实验表明，MAE在各种评估指标上始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多尺度几何自编码器通过非对称设计有效解决了同时保留数据全局和局部几何结构的问题，取得了优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and
dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that
high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical
challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data
in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either
global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often
encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods
frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale
relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which
introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales
of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the
encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical
analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the
distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate
that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation
metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为随机选择探测(RSP)的假设检验框架，用于检测语言模型和视觉语言模型之间的相关性，通过统计p值量化模型关联证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和视觉语言模型的普及，需要可靠技术来确定模型是否经过微调或与另一个模型相同。现有方法需要访问模型参数或产生无原则阈值的启发式分数。

Method: RSP在参考模型上优化文本或视觉前缀用于随机选择任务，评估其到目标模型的可转移性，产生严格的p值。通过引入无关基线模型过滤通用可转移特征来减少误报。

Result: 在LLM和VLM上的实验表明，RSP对相关模型产生小p值，对不相关模型保持高p值。消融研究证明了RSP的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RSP是首个用于模型相关性检测的原则性和通用统计框架，可在现代机器学习生态系统中实现透明和可解释的决策。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine
whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another.
Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or
produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their
applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a
hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a
statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model
for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target
model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To
mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to
filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and
VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models.
Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently
yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for
unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness
of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general
statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and
interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冻结步态影响超过50%的中晚期帕金森病患者，显著损害患者行动独立性。现有检测系统需要大量患者特定训练数据且缺乏泛化能力，限制了临床应用。

Method: 结合自监督预训练和传感器上下文集成，使用轻量级CNN-LSTM活动分类器仅在行走或站立时激活基础模型，避免不必要的计算。

Result: 在VCU FoG-IMU数据集上对23名PD患者进行评估，FM-FoG在未见患者上达到98.5%的F1分数，显著优于基线方法。在Google Pixel 8a手机上部署，电池寿命延长达72%，干预延迟低于20ms。

Conclusion: FM-FoG能够实现实用、节能的医疗应用，无需个体化训练要求即可跨患者泛化。

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence
and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where
walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing
or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection
systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack
generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23
PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen
patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on
a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72%
while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our
FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that
generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

TL;DR: 论文发现语言模型中存在一类特殊的Wasserstein神经元，它们虽然数量极少但对模型功能至关重要。这些神经元在负激活区域对相似输入进行区分，特别是对语法标记的处理，是语言模型依赖的关键语法机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型中特定类型神经元的功能作用，特别是理解为什么少数神经元对模型整体功能如此关键，以及它们在语法处理中的具体机制。

Method: 通过有针对性的神经元移除实验，分析Wasserstein神经元在负激活区域对相似输入的分化作用，使用词性分析和分层干预来定位语法功能。

Result: 移除Wasserstein神经元的负预激活会显著削弱模型功能并破坏语法行为，而随机控制组影响较小。词性分析显示语法支架标记受到特别影响，且局部退化会在深度上累积。

Conclusion: Wasserstein神经元在负激活区域对相似输入的分化是语言模型依赖的关键语法机制，这些稀疏但高度纠缠的神经元对语法处理至关重要。

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein
neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite
constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal
collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating
similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding
smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative
pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are
driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic
tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region
is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal,
sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a
small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function
and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched
controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech
analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and
layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate
across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical
behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results
identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a
crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

### [554] [MDD-Thinker: Towards Large Reasoning Models for Major Depressive Disorder Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24217)
*Yuyang Sha,Hongxin Pan,Gang Luo,Caijuan Shi,Jing Wang,Kefeng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MDD-Thinker是一个基于大语言模型的抑郁症诊断框架，通过监督微调和强化学习增强推理能力，在UK Biobank数据集上训练，显著优于传统方法和通用LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前抑郁症诊断主要依赖主观评估，缺乏多模态临床信息整合能力。大语言模型虽能提高诊断准确性，但面临可解释性差、幻觉问题和依赖合成数据等挑战。

Method: 开发MDD-Thinker框架，结合监督微调和强化学习增强推理能力和可解释性。使用UK Biobank数据集生成40,000个推理样本，并补充10,000个公开心理健康数据集样本进行微调。

Result: MDD-Thinker达到0.8268准确率和0.8081 F1分数，显著优于SVM、MLP等传统方法和通用LLM。结合SFT和RL带来最大改进：准确率相对提升29.0%，F1分数提升38.1%，AUC提升34.8%。

Conclusion: 这是首个基于大规模真实世界临床数据的推理增强LLM抑郁症诊断框架。MDD-Thinker在准确性、可解释性和效率之间取得平衡，为智能精神科诊断提供了可扩展方法。

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global
disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective
assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information.
Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability,
hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank
dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000
samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was
fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning
performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and
state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081,
significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well
as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest
improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and
34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance
compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework
for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By
integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric
diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide
clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader
applications in mental health care.

TL;DR: 提出Conda优化器，结合Adam的坐标自适应性和全局谱归一化，在LLaMA和GPT-2预训练中比AdamW快2-2.5倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Adam优化器在LLM预训练中存在的谱条件差和低秩结构问题，同时保持其快速收敛特性

Method: 通过将更新投影到正交子空间并基于投影梯度应用列级二阶矩归一化，实现改进的谱条件和坐标自适应

Result: 在LLaMA和GPT-2系列上，Conda比AdamW、Muon等基线方法表现更好，收敛速度提升2-2.5倍

Conclusion: Conda是LLM大规模训练中有效且广泛适用的优化器

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and
emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive
and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast
convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal
that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank
structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral
normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges
the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal
subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the
projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and
maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral
pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive
experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently
outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on
the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence
speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further
ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These
results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable
optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法往往会扭曲细节或引入伪影，难以在保持源图像视觉相似性的同时实现高质量语义编辑。

Method: 通过使用相同的相关噪声驱动源图像和编辑图像，利用耦合SDEs引导采样过程，适用于扩散模型和整流流模型等可被SDE采样的预训练模型。

Result: 该方法无需重新训练或辅助网络即可工作，实现了高提示保真度和接近像素级的一致性。

Conclusion: 耦合SDEs是控制生成AI的简单而强大的工具。

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ML在工业应用中因高昂成本和运营中断而难以落地的问题，特别是为中小企业提供可行的ML集成方案。

Method: 采用API框架战略性地分离ML模型生命周期与生产环境，通过浏览器界面实现人机交互控制，支持专家调整模型参数。

Conclusion: 该框架为制造业提供了一条可扩展且易于实施的ML集成路径，通过人机协作增强生产质量和安全性。

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial
competitiveness, yet its adoption is frequently stalled by the prohibitive
costs and operational disruptions of upgrading legacy systems. The financial
and logistical overhead required to support the full ML lifecycle presents a
formidable barrier to widespread implementation, particularly for small and
medium-sized enterprises. This paper introduces a pragmatic, API-based
framework designed to overcome these challenges by strategically decoupling the
ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the
analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based
interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model
maintenance can occur with zero production downtime. This human-in-the-loop
approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters,
fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework
offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and
safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing
sector.

TL;DR: 提出了首个PU学习基准，系统比较PU学习算法，解决了实验设置不一致、模型选择不现实以及不同设置间公平比较的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PU学习算法实验设置高度不一致，难以确定哪种算法性能更好，且许多算法依赖包含负样本的验证集进行模型选择，这在传统PU学习设置中是不现实的。

Method: 开发了PU学习基准框架，系统研究PU学习的模型选择标准，识别单样本和双样本设置之间的差异，提出简单有效的校准方法来解决单样本设置中的内部标签偏移问题。

Result: 创建了一个可访问、现实且公平的PU学习算法评估环境，能够确保不同设置内部和跨设置间的公平比较。

Conclusion: 该基准框架为未来PU学习算法的评估提供了标准化和公平的环境，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification
problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive
and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU
learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However,
experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify
which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU
learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our
implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the
realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many
PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for
model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where
no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically
investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the
problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e.,
the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols
are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant
difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of
unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet
effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across
families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair
environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

### [559] [ChessArena: A Chess Testbed for Evaluating Strategic Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24239)
*Jincheng Liu,Sijun He,Jingjing Wu,Xiangsen Wang,Yang Chen,Zhaoqi Kuang,Siqi Bao,Yuan Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为ChessArena的国际象棋测试平台，用于评估大型语言模型的战略推理能力。通过让13个LLM进行800多场比赛，发现当前模型在国际象棋这种需要复杂战略推理的任务上表现不佳，甚至无法击败业余人类水平的国际象棋引擎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型是否真正具备复杂战略推理能力，还是仅仅擅长训练数据中的模式识别。国际象棋需要长期规划、严格规则理解和多轮对话记忆等能力，是测试战略推理的理想任务。

Method: 创建ChessArena竞争框架，让LLM在四种不同游戏模式下相互对战。测试平台配备排名算法和排行榜，可以评估基本理解、走子选择和谜题解决等细粒度能力。

Result: 测试结果显示当前LLM存在显著缺陷：没有模型能击败业余人类水平的Maia-1100国际象棋引擎，有些甚至无法击败随机走子的玩家。微调的Qwen3-8B模型性能大幅提升，接近更大的最先进推理模型。

Conclusion: 当前大型语言模型在复杂战略推理方面仍存在重大局限性，需要进一步改进才能真正具备类似人类的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities.
However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning
skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling
at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address
this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic
reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,
and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a
competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different
play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.
The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic
understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different
modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal
significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess
engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random
player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the
testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,
approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将预训练-迁移范式扩展到图结构上的运筹学问题面临挑战，因为语言的统计灵活性与图的严格组合约束之间存在根本冲突。

Method: 引入LLM式的自监督预训练范式，在图上的随机游走路径上进行训练，使GFM内化图的复杂拓扑和组合规则，将连接性本身作为监督信号。

Result: 在20到893个节点的网络上进行综合实验，GFM在多种不同优化任务类别上实现了与专用求解器竞争的性能，同时保持显著更快的推理时间。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了将预训练-迁移框架适应图优化的新范式，为将基础模型创新应用于运筹学打开了大门。

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language
models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models
that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending
this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains
challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility
of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this
gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable
of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By
introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths
generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the
graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of
the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing
neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our
approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's
intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to
tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive
experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM
achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety
of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster
inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the
pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for
applying foundation model innovations to OR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESP作弊难以检测，因为其效果不可直接观察，且缺乏可靠标注数据。作弊者还会调整行为来伪装作弊，进一步增加了检测难度。

Method: 将作弊者和非作弊者建模为具有不同可观测性的强化学习智能体，检测器对其行为轨迹进行分类。将作弊者与检测器的交互建模为对抗游戏，引入结构化作弊者模型动态切换作弊行为。

Result: 实验表明该框架成功模拟了自适应作弊行为，能够战略性地平衡奖励优化和检测规避。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究自适应作弊行为和开发有效作弊检测器提供了可控且可扩展的平台。

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game
information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their
effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable
evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is
essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters
often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which
further complicates detection and detector development. To address these
challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP
cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and
non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of
observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we
formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an
adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect
realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that
dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on
detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully
simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward
optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and
extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing
effective cheat detectors.

Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型难以将语言指令作为先验约束融入EEG表征学习，限制了利用语言语义知识统一不同标签和任务的能力。

Method: 提出ELASTIQ模型，包含预训练阶段的联合谱时重构模块（结合频率掩码和两种时间目标），以及指令调优阶段的指令条件Q-Former，通过可学习查询将指令嵌入注入EEG标记并与文本标签嵌入对齐。

Conclusion: 分析首次揭示显式任务指令作为语义先验，引导EEG嵌入进入连贯且基于语言的空间。代码和预训练权重将发布。

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which
capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the
development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches
still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for
EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic
knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address
this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language
Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates
task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned
EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In
the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction
(STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral
perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to
capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential
dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the
Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention
transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them
with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on
20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual
evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best
average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses
reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic
priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.
The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

Motivation: 分布式强化学习方法在异构异步计算和通信瓶颈下的理论研究相对不足，需要开发能够有效处理这些挑战的新算法。

Result: 理论分析显示两种算法都优于现有方法，实验验证了其显著性能提升，特别是在异构异步环境下。

Conclusion: 提出的Rennala NIGT和Malenia NIGT算法在分布式强化学习中实现了最先进的效率，为处理异步和异构环境提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods
under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While
non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved
remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less
explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous
computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms,
Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient
aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous
setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and
communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the
heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous
computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical
guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that
our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

Motivation: 土壤有机碳是土壤健康和全球气候韧性的基础，但由于复杂的物理、化学和生物过程，其预测仍然困难。

Method: 采用基于通用微分方程的科学机器学习框架，将机械物理（如平流扩散传输）与学习非线性微生物生产和呼吸的神经网络相结合，使用合成数据集系统评估六种实验情况。

Result: 在无噪声和中等噪声（7%）条件下，模型准确重建SOC动态（MSE低至1.6e-5，R²高达0.9999）；但在高噪声（35%）条件下出现明显过拟合或过度平滑，失去泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通用微分方程适用于可扩展、耐噪声的SOC预测，但向实地部署推进需要噪声感知损失函数、概率建模和更紧密的微生物动力学整合。

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate
resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical,
chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific
Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend
mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural
networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using
synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases,
progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%)
multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the
potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise
settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal
profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5,
and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 =
0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic
measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear
evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy
but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise
at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture
depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of
standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs
are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing
toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic
modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出SALT方法，使用固定教师模型替代EMA更新，通过两阶段训练（像素重建和掩码潜在预测）实现更高效、可扩展的视频表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: V-JEPA中的EMA更新机制虽然防止表示崩溃，但使模型选择复杂化且耦合师生架构，需要更简单高效的替代方案。

Method: 两阶段训练：先训练目标编码器进行像素重建，然后固定该教师模型，训练学生模型预测掩码区域的潜在表示。

Result: SALT在多个基准测试中超越V-JEPA 2编码器，计算效率更高，缩放曲线主导V-JEPA的准确率-FLOPs帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: SALT是EMA自蒸馏的简单、可扩展且计算高效的替代方案，学生质量对教师质量具有鲁棒性，建议将计算预算主要分配给学生训练。

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

Conclusion: AuON提供了一种计算高效的替代方案，无需构建半正交矩阵即可实现正交梯度更新的优势

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in
optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as
SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and
underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is
applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon,
improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing
semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to
O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based
updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm
trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit
semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized
nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance
without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural
alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines
hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating
both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz
methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a
single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language
benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable
to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

TL;DR: 提出H+方法，一种相似性感知聚合方法，可在有无干净数据的情况下有效防御拜占庭攻击，通过随机选择参数向量片段进行相似性比较来识别诚实客户端。


<details>

Result: H+在所有评估场景和基准数据集上都表现出色，在不同拜占庭攻击比例和多种传统拜占庭攻击下，相比现有方法显著提高了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: H+是一种最先进的相似性感知聚合方法，计算复杂度低，能在有无干净数据的情况下有效防御拜占庭攻击，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can
compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server.
Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate
such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on
similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data,
i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt
this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to
settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel
similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing
methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL
systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects
$r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to
the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment
against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for
aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust
algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data.
Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest
clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an
analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of
clients and $Kr \ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness
improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and
multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios
and benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现实世界物理环境中的PDE系统参数多变，如何在有限训练数据下实现跨分布外场景的泛化至关重要。现有方法需要额外的测试时样本进行领域特定适应，零样本泛化能力不足。

Result: 在模拟基准和实际应用中，iMOOE在分布内性能和各种分布外预测场景的零样本泛化能力方面表现出色。

Conclusion: iMOOE通过捕捉PDE系统的物理不变性，成功实现了在未见过的分布外场景下的零样本泛化，为科学和工程问题中的物理动力学预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

Conclusion: 该框架使决策者能够根据各种场景以及玩家和设计师的多样化需求，做出明智的生成器选择。

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing
interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A
number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are
naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both
relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation
approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those
dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by
considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We
formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each
diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a
multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple
diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is
proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.
demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional
diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a
range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,
including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability
enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators
accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and
designers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型能够以任意顺序生成标记，这与标准自回归语言模型顺序生成的方式不同，导致现有水印方案无法直接应用

Method: 通过(i)在上下文标记尚未完全确定时应用期望水印，(ii)提升能增强其他标记水印强度的标记，同时保持水印检测器不变

Result: 实验评估显示该水印方案真阳性率>99%，质量影响最小，且与现有ARLM水印具有相似的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 首次实现了可靠的扩散语言模型水印，为这一新兴LLM范式提供了有效的版权保护方案

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models
(DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in
contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate
tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key
challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is
that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available
with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying
the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are
yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark
strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while
keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with
minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM
watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AXIS框架通过为冻结的LLM提供三种互补提示（符号数值提示、上下文集成步对齐提示、任务先验提示）来解决时间序列异常检测中的可解释性问题，避免了直接序列化的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列异常检测需要不仅判断是否发生异常，还要解释异常模式和原因。现有方法将时间序列作为文本处理，但LLM难以直接处理长的连续信号，导致缺乏上下文基础和表示对齐。

Method: AXIS框架不直接序列化，而是为冻结LLM提供三种提示：符号数值提示用于数值基础、上下文集成步对齐提示从预训练时间序列编码器提取细粒度动态、任务先验提示编码全局异常特征。

Result: 实验表明AXIS产生更高质量的解释，并在检测精度上与通用LLM、专用时间序列LLM和时间序列视觉语言模型具有竞争力。

Conclusion: AXIS成功解决了时间序列异常检测的可解释性挑战，通过多提示方法实现了更好的解释质量和检测性能。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练小型到中型transformer解码器（30M-200M参数）时，相比AdamW节省48-52%训练计算量，同时保持或改善最终困惑度。与MLA和MoE结合时，能实现68%内存减少和3.2倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Muon优化器的理论基础、收敛特性及其与现代架构优化的协同作用，验证其在计算效率方面的优势。

Method: 提供严格的理论分析，包括收敛率证明、谱正则化特性、与Stiefel流形上自然梯度下降的联系，以及谱范数下最速梯度下降的等价性。结合MLA和MoE进行实证研究。

Result: Muon在保持数据效率的同时扩展了Pareto边界，特别是在大批量训练时。与MLA+MoE结合实现68%内存减少、3.2倍推理加速，困惑度改善8-12%。

Conclusion: Muon是AdamW的一个有原则、稳健的替代方案，特别在与现代效率技术和大批量训练机制结合时表现优异。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon
optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M -
200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence
properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural
optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide
rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under
standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent
gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel
manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral
norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the
compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch
sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our
model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the
training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final
perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head
Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative
efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$
inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed
procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes
across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including
Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized
by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that
particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and
large-batch training regimes.

Conclusion: 利用表示散射作为归纳信号可以有效增强时空异常检测，提出的ScatterAD方法通过建模时间和拓扑维度的散射实现了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies
in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However,
traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal
dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and
limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this
work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous
samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples
are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as
scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample
representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance
spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model
representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD
incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering
and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared
error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive
fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and
topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that
maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological
views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that
ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series
anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备产生大量多变量时间序列数据，需要在资源受限的边缘环境中进行高效准确处理。HD计算虽然高效但难以捕捉复杂时间模式，而Transformer擅长序列建模但计算和内存开销大。

Method: 提出BiHDTrans模型，将自注意力机制整合到HD计算范式中，利用全息高维空间的二元化特性，在FPGA上实现硬件加速的流水线实现。

Result: BiHDTrans比最先进的HD计算模型准确率至少提高14.47%，比最先进的二元Transformer平均准确率高6.67%。在FPGA加速下，推理延迟比最先进二元Transformer低39.4倍。即使维度减少64%，仍比最先进二元Transformer准确率高1-2%，模型大小减少4.4倍，延迟比全维度基线进一步降低49.8%。

Conclusion: BiHDTrans成功弥合了Transformer的表达能力和HD计算效率之间的差距，为资源受限环境中的多变量时间序列分类提供了准确、可扩展和低延迟的解决方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

Motivation: 多模态表示学习产生的高维嵌入虽然具有良好的泛化能力，但也带来了存储和下游处理的可扩展性挑战。关键问题是如何在减少多模态嵌入内存占用的同时，保持其跨模态表示共享语义内容的能力。

Method: 提出一种基于模态对齐的语义压缩方法，当模态间隙充分减小时，不同模态但表达相同语义的嵌入会共享空间中的共同部分，因此它们的质心可以忠实表示语义概念。该方法直接在预训练编码器上操作，用单个质心替换多个嵌入。

Result: 在多样化的大规模多模态下游任务中验证了方法的有效性，实现了显著的压缩效果且不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 模态对齐是实现语义压缩的关键推动因素，所提出的方法在保持性能的同时实现了显著的压缩效果。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that
align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong
generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of
storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve
semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings
while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across
modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the
modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different
modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the
gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but
expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,
their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This
enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding
significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic
compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained
encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale
multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a
key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach
achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

Result: 提出了分布异常值鲁棒联邦学习算法，建立了收敛保证，在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过不平衡Wasserstein距离和KL惩罚有效处理联邦学习中的分布扰动和异常值问题，提供了鲁棒性保证和收敛性证明。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct
data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of
data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance
against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set.
However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of
outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned
models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with
explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the
unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric
distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler
penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally
leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable
decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian
penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this
reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated
learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 核方法虽然具有坚实的理论基础和统计保证，但其可扩展性长期以来受到时间和内存成本的限制。在基础模型时代，需要从海量无标签数据中学习表示，但缺乏可扩展的核表示学习框架。

Conclusion: KREPES不仅解决了核表示学习的可扩展性问题，还提供了比深度模型更原则化的表示可解释性，通过专门分析验证了这一优势。

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and
non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical
guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time
and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no
framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting
their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned
from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable
framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation.
KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses,
and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency.
Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned
representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate
through dedicated analysis.

Motivation: 虽然等变KAN已在特定数据类型中探索，但缺乏在通用背景下应用于具有置换对称性数据的原理性框架。

Method: 通过将参数共享方案推广到Kolmogorov-Arnold设置，推导FS-KAN层的基本构造，并提供理论分析证明其表达能力与标准参数共享网络相同。

Result: 在多种数据类型和对称群上的实证评估显示，FS-KAN在某些情况下相比标准参数共享层具有显著优越的数据效率。

Conclusion: FS-KAN在低数据状态下保持了KAN的可解释性和适应性，使其成为优秀的架构选择。

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes
have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries,
significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the
resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated
promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to
traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been
explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled
framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general
context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a
principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for
arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending
previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN
layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup
and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same
expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,
allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from
parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data
types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency
compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain
cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making
them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

TL;DR: SMoPE是一个新颖的持续学习框架，通过稀疏混合专家架构组织共享提示，仅激活相关专家子集来平衡任务特定提示和共享提示策略的优势，在减少参数和计算成本的同时实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中任务特定提示策略计算开销大、内存需求随任务数量线性增长，而共享提示策略存在知识干扰导致性能下降的权衡问题。

Method: 将共享提示组织为稀疏MoE架构中的多个提示专家；引入提示注意力分数聚合机制进行动态稀疏激活；提出自适应噪声机制平衡专家利用；设计基于原型的损失函数增强专家专业化。

Result: 在多个持续学习基准测试中，SMoPE始终优于任务特定提示方法，性能与最先进方法相当，同时显著减少参数数量和计算成本。

Conclusion: SMoPE成功平衡了效率和性能的权衡，为持续学习提供了一种既高效又有效的提示学习方法。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning
(CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent
strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task,
which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes
memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely,
approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater
efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge
interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework
that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt
strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix
Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into
multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input,
only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating
interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention
score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each
expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an
adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while
preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert
specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix
keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple
CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific
prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational
costs.

*Charmaine Barker,Daniel Bethell,Simos Gerasimou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GUIDE是一个轻量级的证据学习元模型方法，可以附加到冻结的深度学习模型上，明确学习如何以及何时表达不确定性，无需重新训练或修改架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的分布偏移下的不确定性量化仍然是深度学习模型部署的主要障碍。现有方法要么继承错误置信度，要么仅重塑预测，而没有教会模型何时应该不确定。

Method: GUIDE通过校准阶段识别显著内部特征，然后使用这些特征构建噪声驱动的课程，教会模型如何以及何时表达不确定性。无需重新训练、架构修改或手动中间层选择。

Result: GUIDE避免了从基础模型蒸馏过度自信，将分布外检测提高了约77%，对抗攻击检测提高了约80%，同时保持分布内性能。

Conclusion: GUIDE在多样化基准测试中始终优于最先进方法，证明需要主动引导不确定性来缩小预测置信度与可靠性之间的差距。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the
deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing
post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced
confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be
uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model
approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns
how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a
calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven
curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE
requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual
intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring
broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids
distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution
detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving
in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively
guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and
reliability.

*Zhaomin Wu,Haodong Zhao,Ziyang Wang,Jizhou Guo,Qian Wang,Bingsheng He*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了LLM DNA的概念，作为大语言模型功能行为的低维表示，用于解决LLM进化关系不透明的问题，并构建了LLM的进化树。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型数量爆炸式增长，但通过微调、蒸馏或适配产生的进化关系往往缺乏文档记录或不清晰，这给LLM管理带来了困难。现有方法受限于任务特异性、固定模型集或对分词器和架构的严格假设。

Method: 受生物DNA启发，数学定义LLM DNA为功能行为的低维双Lipschitz表示，证明其满足遗传和遗传决定论特性，并建立DNA存在性。基于此理论，推导出通用、可扩展、无需训练的DNA提取流程。

Result: 在305个LLM上的实验表明，DNA与先前有限子集研究一致，在特定任务上表现优越或具有竞争力。DNA比较揭示了LLM之间先前未记录的关联，并构建了与架构转变（编码器-解码器到仅解码器）、时间进展相符的进化树，揭示了不同LLM家族的进化速度差异。

Conclusion: LLM DNA为理解和管理大语言模型的进化关系提供了理论基础和实践工具，能够揭示模型间的遗传关系并构建进化历史。

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but
opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary
relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often
undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are
limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about
tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these
limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional,
bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA
satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the
existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable,
training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA
aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or
competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons
uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct
the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with
shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal
progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出测试时训练(TTT)有效是因为基础模型在全局上仍然参数不足，TTT提供了在泛化后进行专业化的机制，将模型容量集中在测试任务相关的概念上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对TTT有效性的解释主要关注分布外适应或特权数据使用，但随着基础模型规模扩大且大多数测试数据是分布内数据，这些解释受到质疑。作者认为需要新的理论框架来解释TTT在分布内数据上的有效性。

Method: 在线性表示假设下提出理论模型，并通过在ImageNet上训练稀疏自编码器验证关键假设，最后在图像和语言任务上进行扩展研究。

Result: 理论分析显示TTT能实现比全局训练更小的分布内测试误差，实证验证了语义相关数据点仅由少数共享概念解释的假设，并确定了专业化最有效的应用场景。

Conclusion: TTT的有效性源于基础模型的全局参数不足，通过专业化机制在泛化后聚焦于测试任务相关概念，为理解TTT提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a
model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and
have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is
limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations
mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to
out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the
growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution
questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain
globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization
after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.
Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in
which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than
global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by
training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related
data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform
scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical
implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most
effective.

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何在深度学习模型中引入物理归纳偏置，以在模型效能和效率（计算、能耗、碳足迹）之间取得平衡，特别针对时空预测任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习开发过度关注模型效能（准确度指标），导致大规模模型需要大量资源，产生显著的碳足迹。作者希望探索物理归纳偏置如何提供效能与效率之间的有益权衡。

Method: 研究了多种时空预测模型，包括标准物理信息模型和更新的流匹配模型，探索不同层次的物理归纳偏置嵌入到模型设计中。

Result: 实验表明，嵌入物理归纳偏置可以在保持甚至提高任务效能的同时，显著提升模型效率。流匹配模型被证明是时空预测的通用有效方法。

Conclusion: 物理归纳偏置为提升机器学习模型效率和减少碳足迹提供了原则性方法。模型效率应与模型效能一起成为机器学习模型开发和部署的核心考量。

Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the
push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on
efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive
resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model
life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer
useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy,
and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a
task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels
of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into
the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even
improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using
standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness
of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for
spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics
inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce
the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model
efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration
driving machine learning model development and deployment.

Motivation: 现有方法在全微调共享基础模型时会导致严重遗忘和知识干扰，且依赖可能引入语义扭曲的数据增强策略。

Method: 集成专家混合架构，每个专家使用LoRA矩阵参数化；语义感知专家选择机制动态路由实例；对比学习目标利用标签描述；知识蒸馏策略防止内存缓冲区过拟合。

Result: 在多个FCED基准测试中持续实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: LEAF框架有效解决了少样本持续事件检测中的双重挑战，通过专家专业化减少知识干扰，在有限数据设置中提高泛化能力。

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: SWAX是一种结合滑动窗口注意力机制和xLSTM线性RNN层的混合架构，通过随机改变窗口大小训练，在短上下文和长上下文任务上都优于常规窗口注意力方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明混合架构优于单独的注意力机制或RNN，但窗口长度的影响以及注意力与RNN层之间的相互作用研究不足。

Method: 提出SWAX架构，结合滑动窗口注意力和xLSTM线性RNN层，采用随机窗口大小训练策略，强制模型同时利用长上下文窗口和xLSTM记忆。

Result: 反直觉发现：更大的滑动窗口不会改善长上下文性能，短窗口注意力反而能更好地训练xLSTM的长期记忆。随机窗口大小训练显著提升了短上下文和长上下文任务的性能。

Conclusion: SWAX通过随机窗口大小训练策略，有效平衡了短上下文和长上下文需求，在混合架构中实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax
attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform
both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window
length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain
under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture
consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not
improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention
encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by
relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for
short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately
larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically
changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer
context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes
significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and
long-context problems.

TL;DR: 使用深度强化学习(DRL)在实验环境中对高雷诺数(Re=3000)圆柱体涡激振动进行实时主动流动控制，通过旋转驱动实现了超过95%的振动抑制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 突破以往低雷诺数数值模拟的限制，在具有实际约束(如执行器延迟)的挑战性实验环境中验证DRL在主动流动控制中的适应性。

Method: 采用深度强化学习算法，通过旋转驱动控制圆柱体涡激振动。初始仅提供状态反馈(位移和速度)，后续通过增加历史控制动作来克服执行延迟。

Result: 仅使用状态反馈时，DRL学习到低频旋转控制策略，实现80%振动抑制；增加历史控制信息后，学习到高频旋转策略，实现超过95%振动衰减。

Conclusion: 深度强化学习能够适应真实实验环境，克服仪器限制如执行延迟，在主动流动控制中表现出强大的适应性。

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)
in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary
actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number
numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a
challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints
such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state
feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL
agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%
vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While
this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance
achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is
attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning
algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a
high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex
shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate
the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to
overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

Motivation: 探索视觉语言动作模型(VLAs)是否在基于策略的强化学习训练中隐式学习了世界模型，这是基于模型的强化学习的标志性特征。

Method: 使用嵌入向量算术方法，通过线性和非线性探针分析OpenVLA模型各层的激活状态，测量状态转换向量的可恢复性。

Result: 发现OpenVLA在状态转换预测方面具有统计显著性的预测能力，超过了基线水平，表明模型编码了内部世界模型。

Conclusion: OpenVLA确实隐式学习了世界模型，且这种能力随着训练进展而出现，为理解VLAs的内部表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement
learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling
environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly
learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental
methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe
whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent
knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between
embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition
vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non
linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically
significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines
(embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as
opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the
predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that
the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline
leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many
scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and
material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control
inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables,
and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints.
This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires
handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that
integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic
predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently
approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the
optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to
approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables
real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the
coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach
on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation,
heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution
quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct
Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of
magnitude improvement in computational speed.

Conclusion: SAIP通过自适应权重调整解决了现有方法的局限性，为扩散模型在逆问题求解中提供了更优的平衡策略

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments
face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter
requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor
generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains
(e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language
processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture
inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and
lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple
domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches:
(1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task
complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression,
classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern
recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely
low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains.
For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer
parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated
consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision
dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to
90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns,
achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared
error than competing models.

Motivation: 传统的分类模型评估方法未能充分考虑模型使用环境，包括正负样本正确分类的相对价值对决策阈值的影响。需要评估预测模型在不同决策阈值下的期望效用和期望损失。

Method: 通过比较决策曲线分析(DCA)和成本曲线，特别是Brier曲线，分析两者的数学关系、优缺点和适用场景。假设模型分数已校准，并使用正负分类的相对价值来设置分类阈值。

Result: 决策曲线与Brier曲线密切相关，两者x轴等价。在任何给定阈值下，净收益(用于DCA)和Brier损失(用于Brier曲线)总是选择相同的最优模型。Brier曲线适用范围更广，其下面积即为Brier分数。

Conclusion: Brier曲线比决策曲线分析具有更广泛的适用性，特别是在考虑更广泛阈值范围时。建议使用上包络决策曲线作为DCA的有用比较，显示仅通过重新校准可能实现的净收益增益。

Abstract: Classification models typically predict a score and use a decision threshold
to produce a classification. Appropriate model evaluation should carefully
consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative
value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which
affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and
cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility
and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision
thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related,
and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are
closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both
curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the
classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and
negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net
benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always
choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds,
differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit
cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider
range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the
Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be
included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful
comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be
achieved through recalibration alone.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理直觉网络架构虽然能强制执行基本属性如能量守恒，但在扩展到本质高维系统时面临重大挑战。

Method: 基于两个核心组件：几何约束辛自编码器学习低维结构保持辛子流形，以及几何哈密顿神经网络在子流形上建模动力学。

Result: 实验证明RO-HNN能够提供物理一致、稳定且可泛化的复杂高维动力学预测。

Conclusion: RO-HNN有效扩展了哈密顿神经网络在高维物理系统中的应用范围。

Abstract: By embedding physical intuition, network architectures enforce fundamental
properties, such as energy conservation laws, leading to plausible predictions.
Yet, scaling these models to intrinsically high-dimensional systems remains a
significant challenge. This paper introduces Geometric Reduced-order
Hamiltonian Neural Network (RO-HNN), a novel physics-inspired neural network
that combines the conservation laws of Hamiltonian mechanics with the
scalability of model order reduction. RO-HNN is built on two core components: a
novel geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a
low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and a geometric
Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on the submanifold. Our
experiments demonstrate that RO-HNN provides physically-consistent, stable, and
generalizable predictions of complex high-dimensional dynamics, thereby
effectively extending the scope of Hamiltonian neural networks to
high-dimensional physical systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Identity Bridge机制，通过在零跳身份任务上监督模型，解决了大语言模型在组合推理中的"两跳推理诅咒"问题，使模型能够成功执行分布外的两跳推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在组合推理任务中经常失败，特别是在两跳推理任务上表现不佳，这被称为"两跳推理诅咒"。

Method: 引入Identity Bridge机制，在零跳身份任务上监督模型；使用简化的Emb-MLP模型进行理论分析；通过小初始化或权重衰减增强正则化效果；研究大规模模型的隐式推理能力。

Result: 身份监督重塑了模型的潜在几何结构，通过隐式核范数正则化促进低秩解，使模型能够成功执行分布外的两跳推理任务。

Conclusion: Identity Bridge机制有效解决了组合推理问题，为增强大模型的隐式推理能力提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at
compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of
two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet
powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the
model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this
addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop
reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,
we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving
that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this
alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during
optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across
tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to
enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment
effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our
investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop
reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for
enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyperHELM是一个在双曲空间中实现mRNA序列掩码语言模型预训练的框架，通过混合设计将双曲层置于欧几里得骨干网络之上，使学习表示与mRNA和氨基酸之间的生物层次结构对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型越来越多地应用于蛋白质和mRNA等生物序列，但其默认的欧几里得几何可能与生物数据固有的层次结构不匹配。双曲几何为容纳层次数据提供了更好的替代方案，但尚未应用于mRNA序列的语言建模。

Method: 采用混合设计，在欧几里得骨干网络之上添加双曲层，在双曲空间中实现mRNA序列的掩码语言模型预训练。

Result: 在多个多物种数据集上，在10个属性预测任务中有9个优于欧几里得基线，平均提升10%；在长序列和低GC含量序列的分布外泛化方面表现出色；在抗体区域注释任务中，比层次感知的欧几里得模型准确率提高3%。

Conclusion: 双曲几何是mRNA序列层次语言建模的有效归纳偏置。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like
proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the
hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry
provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet
to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we
introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model
pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with
hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned
representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship
between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it
outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property
prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution
generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region
annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation
accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive
bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

TL;DR: T-POP是一种实时个性化方法，通过在线收集用户偏好反馈来指导冻结LLM的解码过程，无需更新模型参数即可实现快速个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前个性化方法存在冷启动问题，需要大量用户数据或资源密集型微调，无法适应新用户的实时需求。

Method: 结合测试时对齐和决斗多臂老虎机，在线学习用户偏好奖励函数，智能平衡探索用户偏好和利用已学知识生成个性化文本。

Result: 实验表明T-POP实现了快速且数据高效的个性化，显著优于现有基线方法，且随着用户交互增加持续改进。

Conclusion: T-POP为解决LLM个性化中的冷启动问题提供了有效方案，通过在线偏好反馈实现了实时个性化。

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is
a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However,
current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically
require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of
pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address
this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by
learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text
generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference
Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment
with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the
decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that
captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently
queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and
exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient
personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing
consistent improvement with more user interactions.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的性能对输入提示高度敏感，但实际应用面临三大挑战：黑盒性质、高查询成本导致的样本效率需求、多用户隐私保护协作需求。

Method: 提出FedPOB算法（联邦线性UCB的变体），代理通过共享模型参数而非原始数据进行协作；进一步扩展为FedPOB-Pref算法，支持比较性用户反馈的联邦对决老虎机方法。

Result: 大量实验表明，FedPOB和FedPOB-Pref显著优于现有基线方法，且随着参与代理数量的增加，性能持续提升。

Conclusion: 基于多臂老虎机的联邦框架能有效解决提示优化中的黑盒、样本效率和隐私协作问题，验证了联邦方法的有效性。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world
application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of
powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query
costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple
users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel
framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on
multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this
problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2)
practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with
theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first
propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a
federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by
sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to
the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with
Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated
dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and
FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their
performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the
collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

Result: 建立了回路专业化、奖励泛化边界和长尾性能之间的形式化联系。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解奖励模型失败提供了理论见解，并为提高长尾鲁棒性提供了实际干预措施。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit
systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and
misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that
identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in
reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization
for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we
hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for
longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections
between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail
performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which
uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble
strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model
failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

TL;DR: Q-Net是一个数据高效且可解释的队列长度估计框架，在部分观测条件下也能稳健运行，结合了环路检测器数据和聚合浮动车数据，使用AI增强的卡尔曼滤波器进行数据融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决信号交叉口队列长度估计的挑战，特别是在部分观测条件下，当交通守恒假设被违反时，需要一种鲁棒且数据高效的方法。

Method: 使用定制状态空间模型和AI增强的卡尔曼滤波器（KalmanNet），结合环路检测器车辆计数和聚合浮动车数据，解耦测量维度与路段长度以实现空间可转移性。

Result: 在鹿特丹主要道路上的评估显示，Q-Net在均方根误差上比基线方法提升超过60%，能准确跟踪队列形成和消散，并纠正aFCD引起的延迟。

Conclusion: Q-Net展示了强大的空间和时间可转移性，无需昂贵的传感基础设施，并提出了实时变体，具有集成到动态队列交通控制系统的潜力。

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in
traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where
vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a
data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that
performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated.
Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i)
vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated
floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and
provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often
differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net
addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented
Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without
requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We
build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality
from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments.
Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with
internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main
roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms
baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately
tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays.
Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling
deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar.
Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its
potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中的潜在分类变量广泛存在，但其离散特性给梯度下降学习带来挑战。现有方法主要改进梯度估计技术，本文从函数设计角度出发，重新审视softmax函数的局限性。

Method: 1) 从信息几何角度分析softmax的局限性；2) 提出用catnat函数替代softmax，该函数由一系列分层二分组成，能产生对角Fisher信息矩阵；3) 在图形结构学习、变分自编码器和强化学习等任务中进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，catnat函数提高了学习效率，并在多个任务中获得了更高的测试性能。该函数易于实现，与现有代码库兼容，且与标准训练稳定技术兼容。

Conclusion: catnat函数是softmax函数的更好替代品，能有效解决潜在分类变量的梯度下降学习问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning
architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning
environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express
relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their
discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning
algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient
estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1)
revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its
limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the
$\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of
a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers
significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher
Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure
learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically
show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields
models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$
is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases.
Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques
and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.

Conclusion: TRIANGLE方法通过几何相似度度量有效提升了多模态对齐效果，在多种三模态任务中达到最先进水平，同时提供可解释的对齐原理。

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

Conclusion: RPEX是一种新颖、简单但有效的方法，能够显著提升离线到在线强化学习在数据污染环境下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online
interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has
emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both
offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often
noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O
RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline
policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data
corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still
unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed
behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of
online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability
Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate
heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed
$\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion.
Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves
SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios. Code is

Method: 在广泛的霍克斯过程分布上生成大规模合成数据集，预训练深度神经网络进行上下文学习，推断事件历史的条件强度函数。

Result: 实验表明这种摊销方法在常见基准数据集上的下一事件预测性能与专门模型相当。

Conclusion: 提出的FIM-PP模型能够无需额外训练或快速微调即可估计现实世界数据的MTPPs，为点过程推理提供了通用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point
processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical
rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP
inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system.
We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and
in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context,
the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined
by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic
dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once
pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can
estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be
rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized
approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction
across common benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法依赖启发式方法或基于孤立计算轨迹的简单模型，需要统一这些信号来改进检测效果。

Method: 将计算轨迹表示为属性图，其中token是节点，边遵循注意力流，两者都携带注意力分数和激活特征，然后应用GNN进行图学习。

Result: CHARM在理论上包含先前的基于注意力的启发式方法，在实验中在不同基准测试中始终优于其他领先方法，并在跨数据集转移中显示出有前景的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 图结构在幻觉检测中发挥重要作用，结合计算轨迹具有显著优势，CHARM方法在幻觉检测任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content,
known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or
simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or
attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed
graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry
features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts
hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying
GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes
prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently
outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results
shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the
benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits
promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.

Result: MarS-FM相比隐式或显式溶剂分子动力学模拟提供超过两个数量级的加速，在RMSD、回转半径和二级结构含量等结构指标上优于现有方法，且在严格序列差异的训练-测试集设置下表现出良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSM Emulators特别是MarS-FM方法能够高效生成蛋白质轨迹，在保持结构统计特性的同时大幅降低计算成本，为蛋白质功能研究提供有力工具。

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing
protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long
timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address
this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate
trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag
transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but
uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM
Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states
defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class
with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two
orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD
simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through
structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary
structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues)
with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events,
and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to
assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing
methods, often by a substantial margin.

flexible setup allows targeted testing of generalisation factors and includes
variants like partial observability, key-and-door tasks, and ice-floor hazards.
By enabling controlled, reproducible experiments, Labyrinth advances the
evaluation of generalisation in imitation learning and provides a valuable tool
for developing more robust agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲电网向可再生能源转型，但风能和太阳能的天气依赖性对电网稳定性构成挑战，特别是Dunkelflaute事件可能导致电力供应短缺。需要评估这些事件对未来德国电力生产的影响。

Method: 采用生成式深度学习框架对CMIP6集合的气候模拟进行降尺度处理，并与ERA5历史数据进行比较，评估在SSP2-4.5和SSP5-8.5排放情景下德国Dunkelflaute事件的未来发生情况。

Conclusion: 在所考虑的气候情景下，与Dunkelflaute事件相关的风险预计在整个世纪内保持稳定。

Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy
sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and
solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a
challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of
low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their
potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate
the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years
and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative
deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6
ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from
ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future
occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low
(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that
both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the
ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the
historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios,
the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.

TL;DR: Fidel-TS是一个新的大规模时间序列预测基准，通过从实时API获取数据构建，解决了现有基准中数据污染和因果泄漏等问题，证明了文本信息的因果相关性是多模态预测获得真正性能提升的关键因素。


<details>

Motivation: 时间序列预测模型的评估因缺乏高质量基准而受到阻碍，现有数据集存在预训练数据污染、因果和描述泄漏等问题，导致进展的假象。

Method: 通过从实时API获取数据构建Fidel-TS基准，遵循数据来源完整性、严格因果合理性和结构清晰性的核心原则。

Result: 实验验证了该方法，揭示了先前基准的关键偏差和设计限制，并证明文本信息的因果相关性是多模态预测获得真正性能提升的关键因素。

Conclusion: 构建高质量基准对于准确评估时间序列预测模型至关重要，文本信息的因果相关性是实现真正性能提升的决定性因素。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical
lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress.
Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data
contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage
prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core
principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity,
strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new
large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing
data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by
exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks.
Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual
information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in
multimodal forecasting.

*Zixu Wang,Hongbin Dong,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了DSAT-HD模型，通过混合分解机制、多尺度自适应路径和双流残差学习框架，解决了传统时间序列预测方法在处理复杂季节性和多尺度特征方面的局限性，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的时间序列预测方法主要建模有限时间序列或固定尺度，难以捕捉不同范围的多样化特征。传统季节趋势分解方法需要预定义季节周期且通常只能处理单一固定季节性。

Method: 1) 混合分解机制结合EMA和傅里叶分解与RevIN归一化，通过噪声Top-k门控动态平衡季节和趋势分量；2) 多尺度自适应路径利用稀疏分配器将特征路由到四个并行Transformer层，通过稀疏组合器合并特征，结合局部CNN和全局交互的混合注意力；3) 双流残差学习框架，CNN和MLP分支分别处理季节和趋势分量，通过最小化专家协作方差的平衡损失函数协调。

Result: 在九个数据集上的广泛实验表明，DSAT-HD整体优于现有方法，并在某些数据集上实现了最先进的性能。该模型在各种迁移场景下也表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DSAT-HD通过创新的混合分解、多尺度自适应和双流学习框架，有效解决了时间序列预测中的复杂季节性和多尺度特征捕捉问题，展现了优越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather,
traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series
forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches
primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging
to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional
methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require
pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed
seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive
Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the
limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining
EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing
seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale
adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four
parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,
enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A
dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately
process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function
minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine
datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also
exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer
scenarios.

TL;DR: DyMoDreamer是一种新型的基于模型的强化学习算法，通过动态调制机制改进动态特征提取和时间信息丰富，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度强化学习中的样本效率低下问题，特别是传统世界模型无法有效分离动态对象和静态背景的局限性。

Method: 采用动态调制机制，通过帧间差分掩码提取差分观测，将动态调制建模为随机分类分布并集成到循环状态空间模型中。

Result: 在Atari 100k基准测试中达到156.6%的人类标准化平均分数，在DeepMind视觉控制套件中创下832的新记录，在Crafter基准测试中1M步后性能提升9.5%。

Conclusion: DyMoDreamer通过专注于奖励相关的动态特征，显著提高了基于模型强化学习的样本效率和性能。

Abstract: A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Ultraman-Tiga1/DyMoDreamer.

Motivation: 现有单细胞基础模型仅限于离散预测头，将细胞复杂性压缩为预定义标签，无法捕获生物学家需要的更丰富、上下文相关的解释。

Method: 通过整合单细胞基础模型的基因级嵌入与预训练大语言模型，构建多模态生成框架，将scRNA-seq图谱转换为结构化自然语言描述。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the
measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information
for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation
models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations
directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and
clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction
heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to
capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce
Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles
into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level
embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language
models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,
tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to
unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification
accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based
similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.
These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language
offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable
outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of
unseen cells.

Motivation: 数字流媒体平台的兴起为研究音乐流行度动态提供了新的数据机会，探索哪些因素最能预测歌曲进入Billboard Hot 100榜单。

Method: 使用逻辑回归、随机森林和梯度提升(XGBoost)三种机器学习模型，分析流媒体流行度、音频信号属性和人类收听概率指标对榜单入选的影响。

Result: 流行度是最决定性预测因子，模型准确率均在90%以上：逻辑回归90.0%，随机森林90.4%，XGBoost 90.3%。随机森林在非上榜歌曲的精确度达0.990，XGBoost在召回率平衡方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 流行度是预测Billboard Hot 100入选的最强因素，机器学习模型能够高精度地预测歌曲的商业成功，为音乐产业提供有价值的分析工具。

Abstract: The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the
landscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing
structured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating
popularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which
determinants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in
the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio
signal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The
analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of
Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from
instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression
achieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but
lower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around
0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy,
maintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high
recall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by
improving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall
for charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other
models.

### [614] [DRIFT-Net: A Spectral--Coupled Neural Operator for PDEs Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24868)
*Jiayi Li,Flora D. Salim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRIFT-Net提出了一种双分支神经网络架构，通过谱分支捕获全局低频信息，图像分支处理局部细节，解决了现有PDE基础模型中全局耦合不足导致的误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PDE基础模型主要采用多尺度窗口自注意力机制，但由于其局部性，真正的全局谱耦合只能通过深度堆叠和窗口移动逐步传播，这削弱了全局耦合并导致闭环推演中的误差累积和漂移。

Method: 采用双分支设计：谱分支负责捕获全局大尺度低频信息，图像分支专注于局部细节和非平稳结构。通过低频范围内的轻量级混合，以及通过频带加权融合两个分支，避免简单拼接导致的宽度膨胀和训练不稳定。

Result: 相比强注意力基线，在相同训练设置和预算下，DRIFT-Net以更少的参数实现了更低的误差和更高的吞吐量。在Navier-Stokes基准测试中，相对L1误差降低了7%-54%，参数数量减少约15%，吞吐量仍高于scOT。

Conclusion: 消融研究和理论分析进一步证明了该设计的稳定性和有效性，DRIFT-Net能够有效保持跨尺度的全局结构和高频细节。

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve
wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers.
In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale
windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \textsc{Poseidon} serving as
a representative example.
  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral
coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window
shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and
drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral
branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing
global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses
on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform
controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the
spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the
width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The
fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image
branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details
across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net
achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under
identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the
relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases
by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies
and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of
this design. The code is available at

Conclusion: 保形预测能有效提高土壤剖面建模中人机协作的标注效率，特别是在回归任务中表现突出

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as
human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the
machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable
more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible
usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well
established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models,
offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and
classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to
$\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles.
We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a
limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is
available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that
conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks
and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same
annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart. All code

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning,
yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models.
In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic
and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging
connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed
phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of
sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between
distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely
reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish
a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained
network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide
a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the
emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization
performance, yielding an interpretation from first principles.

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning,
enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form.
Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during
training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation
theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive
canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends
both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive
canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the
input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove
that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that
admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis
ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational
symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular
and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our
adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to
equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and
equivariant architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然蛋白质语言模型是蛋白质设计的重要研究方向，但其如何将序列转换为隐藏表示以及这些表示中编码的信息尚未完全理解。现有研究主要关注单个序列的转换，而PLM如何转换整个序列空间及其关系仍未知。

Method: 使用平方根速度(SRV)表示和图形过滤方法，在度量空间中比较蛋白质对或蛋白质表示。分析SCOP数据集中的不同类型蛋白质，研究ESM2模型中SRV形状空间的Karcher均值和有效维度随层数的变化模式。

Result: 发现PLM优先编码残基间的即时和局部关系，但在较大上下文长度时性能下降。结构最忠实的编码通常发生在接近但早于模型最后一层的位置。

Conclusion: 在PLM接近最后一层的表示上训练折叠模型可能会提高折叠性能，因为该位置编码了最结构忠实的信息。

Abstract: While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of
research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform
sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such
representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to
propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding
how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in
which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is
still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of
sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root
velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally
lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations
can be compared with each other.
  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that
the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a
non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different
sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context
lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find
that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between
residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most
structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last
layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these
layers might lead to improved folding performance.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)训练LLMs在序列决策中的探索能力，发现训练后的模型在多臂老虎机任务中表现接近经典算法，但在泛化性上存在早期灾难性失败的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在序列决策中探索能力不足，需要研究如何通过SFT和RL训练来提升其探索策略和泛化能力。

Method: 使用SFT在专家轨迹上训练，以及RL配合定制化奖励信号（包括策略性后悔形状奖励和算法模仿奖励）来训练LLMs。

Result: 训练后的代理模型超越预训练模型，性能接近UCB和Thompson Sampling算法，在6倍更长时域和不同老虎机家族中表现出鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: RL/SFT训练使模型更倾向于贪婪利用，容易过早放弃探索。建议采用定制化奖励设计和超越平均后悔的评估来促进鲁棒探索行为。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

Motivation: 抗体治疗特性工程通常需要迭代且成本高昂，贝叶斯优化是自然选择。但为高度结构化的抗体空间选择最优代理模型很困难，且可能因优化特性而异。此前没有工作尝试将结构信息融入抗体贝叶斯优化。

Method: 探索了将结构信息融入贝叶斯优化的不同方法，并与仅使用序列的方法进行比较。提出了基于蛋白质语言模型的"软约束"，帮助引导优化到有前景的空间区域。在两种抗体特性（结合亲和力和稳定性）上进行测试。

Result: 某些类型的结构信息在早期优化轮次中提高了稳定性的数据效率，但峰值性能相当。当加入蛋白质语言模型软约束后，亲和力的数据效率差距减小，稳定性的差距消除，序列方法可以匹配结构方法的性能。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在贝叶斯优化中加入蛋白质语言模型软约束后，序列方法可以达到与结构方法相当的性能，这引发了对抗体贝叶斯优化中结构必要性的质疑。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody
therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However,
finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly
structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the
property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody
Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to
incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare
them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody
properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of
a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the
optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of
structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for
stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating
the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap
is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in
sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,
raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for
antibodies.

*Angxiao Yue,Anqi Dong,Hongteng Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了OAT-FM方法，将流匹配与最优加速传输理论结合，通过优化加速度传输而非恒定速度，实现了更直的流轨迹，并提出了两阶段微调范式来提升现有流匹配模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于最优传输的流匹配方法隐含了流直线化目标，但缺乏理论解释。本文旨在将流匹配与最优加速传输理论结合，从理论和实践上改进流匹配方法。

Method: 提出OAT-FM方法，在样本和速度的乘积空间中优化加速度传输，设计高效算法实现低复杂度计算，并建立两阶段微调范式：先用任意流匹配方法训练模型，再用OAT-FM进行微调。

Result: OAT-FM方法在多种生成任务中一致提升模型性能，避免了数据分布漂移风险，且无需生成大量噪声数据对。

Conclusion: OAT-FM为流匹配提供了新的理论视角和实践方法，通过优化加速度传输实现了更有效的生成建模，其两阶段微调范式具有实用价值。

Abstract: As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to
learn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and
implemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we
bridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT),
developing an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in
both theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening
objective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent
to minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.
Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the
acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose
objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow
straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low
complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative
model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been
relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm
eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large
number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in
various generative tasks. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新的深度Q学习方法，通过正则化减少状态特征表示的正相关性，从而在迁移学习中更有效地使用线性函数逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习训练需要大量超参数调优和计算成本，迁移学习可以重用已有知识避免从头训练。但标准深度RL模型学习到的表示可能高度相关，限制了在线性函数逼近中的有效性。

Method: 提出新颖的深度Q学习方法，引入正则化项来减少状态特征表示之间的正相关性，利用这些相关性降低的特征来更有效地使用线性函数逼近进行迁移学习。

Result: 在标准RL基准和MinAtar游戏上的实验和消融研究表明，该方法能有效提高迁移学习性能并减少计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过减少特征表示的相关性，可以显著提升线性函数逼近在迁移学习中的效果，从而降低深度强化学习的计算成本。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex
sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL
framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as
the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.
Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these
challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for
new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from
scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage
the internal representations learned by the neural network during training.
Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as
refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the
input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used
as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on
new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL
models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used
with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce
positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging
these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear
function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation
studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby
reducing computational overhead.

TL;DR: DUCHESS是一个LLM服务系统，通过基于预测的推理分支编排来降低成本和延迟，同时保持准确性。它使用轻量级线性探测模型评估分支正确性，并通过优先级调度优化多请求处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理算法（如思维链和多分支推理）显著增加了令牌使用和请求延迟，而之前的工作主要关注减少令牌使用但往往牺牲准确性，忽略了其他延迟因素。

Method: 采用轻量级线性探测模型分析LLM层激活来估计分支正确性，编排策略决定终止、复制或继续分支。在多请求处理中，通过难度感知调度优先处理简单推理任务。

Result: 在三个推理基准测试中，DUCHESS将令牌使用减少了42-63%，同时保持准确性。在vLLM服务中，平均、中位数和尾部延迟分别降低了57-81%、58-85%和52-84%。

Conclusion: DUCHESS通过智能分支编排和难度感知调度，在保持准确性的同时显著降低了令牌使用和延迟，为LLM推理服务提供了有效的优化方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning
algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve
accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token
usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token
usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency
factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and
latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration
guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over
LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration
policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When
handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing
easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt.
Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently
improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at
matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS
reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with
First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under
difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的重叠自适应正则化方法(OAR)，通过根据重叠权重比例调整正则化强度，在低重叠区域提高现有CATE元学习器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的条件平均处理效应估计方法在低重叠区域表现不佳，需要一种能够适应不同重叠程度的正则化方法来改善性能。

Method: 引入重叠自适应正则化(OAR)，根据重叠权重比例调整正则化强度，在低重叠区域施加更强的正则化。该方法适用于参数和非参数二阶模型，并提出了保持Neyman正交性的去偏版本。

Result: 通过一系列半合成实验证明，相比恒定正则化，OAR在低重叠设置下显著改善了CATE估计性能。

Conclusion: OAR是首个在元学习器正则化项中利用重叠权重的方法，能够灵活应用于现有CATE元学习器，在低重叠区域提供更好的估计效果。

Abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is widely used in
personalized medicine to inform therapeutic decisions. However,
state-of-the-art methods for CATE estimation (so-called meta-learners) often
perform poorly in the presence of low overlap. In this work, we introduce a new
approach to tackle this issue and improve the performance of existing
meta-learners in the low-overlap regions. Specifically, we introduce
Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models
proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is
higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is
the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of
the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing
CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and
non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions
of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and
thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic
experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation
in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.

Motivation: 数据稀缺推动了对更高效样本利用的大语言模型的需求，需要比较不同模型的样本效率

Method: 利用双下降现象全面比较离散扩散模型和自回归模型的样本效率，分析不同参数化状态下的表现

Result: 离散扩散模型需要更大容量和更多训练轮次才能达到插值阈值；在强过参数化状态下，两种模型表现相似，都没有明显的测试损失二次下降

Conclusion: 自回归模型在小规模数据集上更具样本效率，离散扩散模型只有在获得足够容量和计算资源时才能具有竞争力

Abstract: Data scarcity drives the need for more sample-efficient large language
models. In this work, we use the double descent phenomenon to holistically
compare the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion and autoregressive models.
We show that discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more
training epochs to escape their underparameterized regime and reach the
interpolation threshold. In the strongly overparameterized regime, both models
exhibit similar behavior, with neither exhibiting a pronounced second descent
in test loss across a large range of model sizes. Overall, our results indicate
that autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small-scale datasets,
while discrete diffusion models only become competitive when given sufficient
capacity and compute.

TL;DR: 提出了ROVER算法，通过随机策略评估实现多样化推理，在数学推理任务中取得了更好的质量和多样性表现，同时简化了传统强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法依赖PPO等策略优化框架，存在训练不稳定和多样性崩溃问题，需要复杂启发式技巧。作者发现数学推理中的RLVR具有特殊的MDP结构，可以简化现有方法。

Method: 提出ROVER算法，证明最优动作可以从固定均匀随机策略的Q函数中恢复，绕过传统的策略迭代循环。通过基于这些均匀策略Q值的softmax采样动作。

Result: 在多个基础模型和标准数学推理基准测试中，ROVER在质量（pass@1 +8.2，pass@256 +16.8）和多样性（+17.6%）方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: ROVER是一种极简但高效的RL方法，能够在训练过程中保持多样性，持续探索多个有效路径，相比复杂现有方法实现了显著简化。

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current
methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,
which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating
the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While
effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,
requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard
RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov
Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured
dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying
structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated
techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this
insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from
the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the
generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce
Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this
principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a
minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax
over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout
training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across
multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates
superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1,
\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite
its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

TL;DR: 本文从函数空间视角重新审视PPO算法，通过RKHS中的核化TD评论家和KL正则化策略更新，为PPO提供了超越有限维假设的理论基础，并在控制任务中验证了其稳定性和样本效率。

Motivation: 为PPO算法建立更坚实的理论基础，超越有限维假设，阐明RKHS中的近端更新何时能实现全局策略改进并保持实际效率。

Method: 在RKHS中解耦策略评估和改进：(1)使用核化TD评论家进行高效的RKHS梯度更新；(2)通过KL正则化的自然梯度策略步长恢复PPO/TRPO风格的近端更新。

Result: 获得了非渐近、实例自适应的理论保证，收敛速率依赖于RKHS熵；经验验证显示理论对齐的调度在控制任务中提高了稳定性和样本效率，TD评论家相比GAE基线具有更好的吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该工作为PPO提供了更坚实的理论基础，阐明了RKHS近端更新与核TD评论家在实现全局策略改进和实际效率方面的条件。

Abstract: We revisit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from a function-space
perspective. Our analysis decouples policy evaluation and improvement in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS): (i) A kernelized temporal-difference
(TD) critic performs efficient RKHS-gradient updates using only one-step
state-action transition samples; (ii) a KL-regularized, natural-gradient policy
step exponentiates the evaluated action-value, recovering a PPO/TRPO-style
proximal update in continuous state-action spaces. We provide non-asymptotic,
instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying
tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes,
and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal
$k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the
theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common
control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains
favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline. Altogether, our results place PPO
on a firmer theoretical footing beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and
clarify when RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics yield global policy
improvement with practical efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了针对扩散模型的成员推理攻击，提出了基于预测噪声向量的理论分析，并开发了高效的SimA单查询攻击方法。研究发现潜在扩散模型比像素空间模型更安全，并提出了增强LDM训练鲁棒性的策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型可能无意中泄露训练样本的成员信息，这引发了严重的隐私担忧。现有成员推理攻击方法通常需要多次查询，效率较低。

Method: 基于扩散模型预测的噪声向量理论分析，提出SimA单查询攻击方法。通过分析去噪器输出与训练集邻近性的关系，利用其范数编码的成员信息进行攻击。

Result: SimA在DDPM和LDM等模型上表现一致强劲。发现潜在扩散模型由于潜在自编码器的信息瓶颈而比像素空间模型更安全。通过调整β-VAE的正则化超参数可以增强LDM对MIA的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究巩固了基于分数的成员推理攻击理论，同时强调需要更好地理解VAE的反演而不仅仅是扩散过程的反演，这对潜在扩散模型类方法的安全性至关重要。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

TL;DR: MARCOS提出了一种新的LLM推理范式，用连续的隐马尔可夫思想链代替传统的token生成推理，解决了CoT推理速度慢、信息受限和短视推理的问题，在保持性能的同时实现了15.7倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CoT推理存在三个主要问题：推理速度慢且计算昂贵、受限于离散token空间形成信息瓶颈、推理与token生成耦合导致短视推理。

Method: 将推理建模为连续高维思想的隐马尔可夫链，每个推理步骤对应内部思想的转换，显式推理步骤作为可观测变量。提出两阶段变分训练方案来解决潜在过程与监督学习不兼容的问题。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，MARCOS超越了现有连续推理方法，首次达到与token-based CoT相当的性能，在GSM8K上甚至超出4.7%，同时实现高达15.7倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: MARCOS不仅实现了高效推理，还提供了步骤级而非token级的随机性控制，为强化学习和LLM推理开辟了重要机会。

Abstract: The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves
models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought
(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.
Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT
tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains
reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck
across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with
token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes
potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we
re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our
approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as
a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each
reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit
reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable
variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this
latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we
further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous
reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to
token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup
in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as
step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant
opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Aging infrastructure portfolios pose a critical resource allocation
challenge: deciding which structures require intervention and which can safely
remain in service. Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between
cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that
do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN)
surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge
types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale
database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric
pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio,
the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural
analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated
epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware
triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where
refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to
significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and
physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.

Conclusion: 严格表征了每个相中的极限动态，证明了上述极限下的收敛性，并通过仿真验证了结果。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of
encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system
of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding
dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate
interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this
regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast
phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space,
an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a
slow one, where such clusters sequentially merge into a single one. We provide
a rigorous characterization of the limiting dynamics in each of these phases
and prove convergence in the above mentioned limit, exemplifying our results
with some simulations.

Abstract: As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient
tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning
remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by
considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning
rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance,
where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit
invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines
learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the
original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an
efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory
invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several
existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient

### [634] [Advantage Weighted Matching: Aligning RL with Pretraining in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25050)
*Shuchen Xue,Chongjian Ge,Shilong Zhang,Yichen Li,Zhi-Ming Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)方法，统一扩散模型的预训练和强化学习目标，通过优势加权降低方差并加速收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型强化学习方法（如DDPO）使用与预训练不同的目标函数，导致方差增大和收敛缓慢。本文旨在统一预训练和RL目标。

Method: AWM使用与预训练相同的score/flow-matching损失函数，通过优势权重重新加权样本，提升高奖励样本的影响。

Result: 在GenEval、OCR和PickScore基准测试中，AWM相比Flow-GRPO实现了高达24倍的加速，且不损害生成质量。

Conclusion: AWM方法在理论和实践上统一了扩散模型的预训练和强化学习，降低了方差并加速了收敛。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the
same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for
diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),
optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow
matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is
an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases
variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce
\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for
diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a
lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect,
AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones
while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies
pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with
policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This
simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and
PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO
(which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX,
without compromising generation quality. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分数扩散模型的联合似然估计方法，用于回归任务中的分布外检测，该方法考虑输入和预测结果，提供任务感知的可靠性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动模型在关键科学领域应用广泛，但在分布外数据上容易失败，而回归任务中的失败检测是一个开放挑战。

Method: 使用基于分数扩散模型估计联合似然，同时考虑输入数据和回归模型的预测结果，生成任务感知的可靠性评分。

Result: 在多个科学数据集上的实验表明，该似然估计与预测误差强相关，包括PDE数据集、卫星图像和脑肿瘤分割。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建可验证的'信任证书'奠定了基础，为评估基于AI的科学预测的可信度提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields
like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks
is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating
joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers
not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a
task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including
PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this
likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a
foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby
offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based
scientific predictions. Our code is publicly available at

*Shane Bergsma,Bin Claire Zhang,Nolan Dey,Shaheer Muhammad,Gurpreet Gosal,Joel Hestness*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明在计算效率最优的训练条件下，不同规模的LLM损失曲线可以通过归一化坍缩到统一轨迹上，这为训练病理诊断和超参数调优提供了实用工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在实用扩展配方下，LLM训练损失曲线的坍缩现象是否仍然成立，以及如何利用这种现象来改进训练效率。

Method: 通过分析不同规模模型在最优超参数设置下的训练损失曲线，验证坍缩现象，并应用于训练病理诊断和超参数调优。

Result: 发现当优化超参数根据数据预算最优设置时，损失曲线确实会坍缩到统一轨迹，这可以作为计算效率训练的标志。

Conclusion: 损失曲线坍缩现象是开发高效LLM的有效工具，可用于早期训练问题诊断和超参数优化。

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

Motivation: 传统的思维链蒸馏方法在跨架构知识迁移方面存在局限性，需要一种更有效的蒸馏方法来提升学生模型性能。

Method: 采用Odds-Ratio偏好优化目标对比教师和学生推理轨迹，使用混合策略利用学生生成输出，优于离线和在线策略替代方案。

Conclusion: ORPO-Distill通过偏好优化框架实现了有效的跨架构LLM蒸馏，在多个任务和学生模型上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We introduce ORPO-Distill, a general-purpose method for cross-architecture
LLM distillation that formulates the problem as a preference optimization task.
Unlike standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through
diverse reasoning traces. It employs an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization
objective that contrasts teacher and student traces for more effective
learning, and adopts a mixed-policy strategy for utilizing student-generated
outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督训练工作流，通过结合实验测量探针和程序化生成的合成物体来强调探针学习，使单个物理信息神经网络能够在多个光束线上重建未见过的实验，实现了多探针泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线ptychography是一种数据密集型成像技术，在下一代光源下需要实时反馈。现有深度学习方法缺乏跨实验条件的鲁棒性，需要更通用的重建模型。

Method: 采用无监督训练工作流，结合实验测量探针和程序化生成的合成物体进行探针学习，使用物理信息神经网络实现多光束线实验的重建。

Result: 该方法实现了多探针泛化，重建保真度与仅使用实验数据训练的模型相当，即使改变合成训练对象的类型也能保持性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够训练实验导向模型，在动态实验条件下提供实时反馈，为下一代光源的快速数据采集提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a data-intensive imaging technique expected to become
ubiquitous at next-generation light sources delivering many-fold increases in
coherent flux. The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition
rates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks,
which offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However,
existing deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental
conditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe
learning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic,
procedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single
physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across
multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe
generalization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution
learning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction
fidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even
when changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach
enables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback
under dynamic experimental conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了SIREN方法，通过选择性熵正则化解决强化学习中验证奖励的熵崩溃和过早收敛问题，在数学推理任务上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的熵正则化方法在大推理模型中会导致全局熵爆炸，因为模型会不加区分地探索所有可能的动作和状态，从而无法有效解决熵崩溃和过早收敛问题。

Method: 提出SIREN方法，采用两步熵掩码机制（top-p掩码和峰值熵掩码）将探索限制在有意义的动作和状态子集内，并将正则化转换为自锚定形式以稳定训练。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中，SIREN在平均性能上优于之前的熵相关RLVR方法，特别是在AIME24/25上使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B实现了+6.6 maj@k的提升。

Conclusion: SIREN通过促进更大的响应多样性和将熵维持在适当水平，有效缓解了RLVR在大推理模型中的过早收敛问题，保持了验证pass@k在整个训练过程中的稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

*Daniil Dmitriev,Harald Eskelund Franck,Carolin Heinzler,Amartya Sanyal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了在线学习中的重放设置框架，研究机器学习系统在自标注数据训练时可能强化错误的问题。通过引入扩展阈值维度(ExThD)作为可学习性的精确度量，证明了基于闭包的算法能够达到最优错误界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统越来越多地在自标注数据上训练，它们可能会强化错误并成为自身信念的回音室。这种重放现象可能导致系统性能下降，因此需要理论框架来理解和分析这种学习设置。

Method: 引入在线学习重放设置框架：在每一轮中，学习者输出假设，对手揭示真实标签或来自先前轮次的重放标签。引入扩展阈值维度(ExThD)作为可学习性的精确度量，并设计了基于闭包的学习算法。

Result: 证明了ExThD是重放设置中可学习性的精确度量：基于闭包的学习者最多犯ExThD个错误，且没有算法能做得更好。对于随机对手，证明了每个交集闭类都有类似界限。重放设置比经典错误界限设置更难：某些类具有常数Littlestone维度但任意大的ExThD。

Conclusion: 重放设置为理解自标注数据训练中的错误强化提供了理论框架。ExThD是这一设置中可学习性的精确度量，基于闭包的算法达到最优性能。对于适当学习，只有当类是交集闭时才能实现有效学习，否则每个适当学习者都会遭受线性错误。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they
risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We
model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online
Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis
$\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\ast(x_t)$ or
a replayed label $\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is
counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the
SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.
  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$,
and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model.
A closure-based learner makes at most $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ mistakes
against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For
stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed
class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound
setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper
separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is
(almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers
$\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight
analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for
closure-type algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络压缩技术通常需要昂贵的微调或搜索过程，使其在普通硬件上不实用。受LLM压缩研究启发，开发无需微调的压缩方法。

Method: 提出激活感知因子分解框架和可扩展预算秩分配器，形成BALF压缩管道，可灵活控制压缩目标且无额外开销。

Result: 在ResNet-20到ResNeXt-101和视觉变换器等多种模型上验证，ResNeXt-101的FLOPs减少45%仅导致top-1准确率下降1个百分点。

Conclusion: BALF在无需微调的情况下实现了优秀的压缩效果，适用于多种架构和规模。

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning
or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware.
Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general
activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range
of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that
allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of
parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an
efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate
its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on
CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it
achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF
reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1
accuracy drop.

TL;DR: 本文证明注意力机制能通过选择性关注信息丰富的token来检测稀疏、微弱信号，相比线性分类器具有对数级而非平方根级的信号强度要求，并在高维环境中只需两次梯度更新即可学习有效的注意力映射。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究注意力机制何时以及如何学习选择性关注信息token，以检测稀疏、微弱且位置随机的特征，揭示注意力相对于线性分类器的优势。

Method: 采用稀疏token分类模型，正样本在随机token子集中嵌入弱信号向量，负样本为纯噪声。在长序列极限下分析单层注意力分类器，并在高维环境中研究有限序列长度的训练动态。

Result: 注意力分类器在信号强度仅需对数增长时即可达到零测试误差，而线性分类器需要平方根增长。仅需两次梯度更新即可使查询权重向量与隐藏信号对齐，产生选择性放大信息token的注意力映射。

Conclusion: 注意力机制通过自适应token选择显著优于非自适应线性基线，解释了其在检测稀疏弱信号方面的容量优势。

Abstract: When and how can an attention mechanism learn to selectively attend to
informative tokens, thereby enabling detection of weak, rare, and sparsely
located features? We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token
classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a
randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In
the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention
classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal
strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear
classifiers require $\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to
learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime,
where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that
just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention
classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing
an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further
derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of
the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the
largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby
explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear
baselines.

Motivation: 生成模型虽然能合成复杂数据分布的高保真样本，但经常违反物理定律或任务规范产生的硬约束。现有方法如重复投影会扭曲学习分布，而多阶段方法则增加了算法复杂性。

Method: CCFM方法将随机优化集成到采样过程中，直接在噪声中间样本上操作，但理论上等同于在干净样本上定义可行集进行投影，从而减少分布扭曲。

Result: 实验表明CCFM在建模偏微分方程控制的复杂物理系统和分子对接问题上，优于当前最先进的约束生成模型，提供了更高的可行性和保真度。

Conclusion: CCFM方法能够有效强制执行硬约束，同时保持高保真样本生成，在复杂物理系统和分子对接等应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex
data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from
physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project
intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can
distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold.
Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean
samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and
accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching
(CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process,
enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining
high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in
the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating
directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to
projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a
sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show
that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in
modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations
and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

TL;DR: GLASS Flows提出了一种新的采样范式，通过模拟"流匹配模型中的流匹配模型"来采样马尔可夫转移，结合ODE的效率和SDE的随机演化，消除了推理时奖励对齐算法中的效率瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流匹配和扩散模型在推理时使用奖励对齐算法时，效率受到SDE采样的限制，而ODE采样虽然高效但缺乏随机演化。需要一种结合两者优势的解决方案。

Method: GLASS Flows从预训练模型中提取"内部"流匹配模型来采样马尔可夫转移，无需重新训练，将ODE效率与SDE随机演化相结合。

Result: 在大规模文本到图像模型上，GLASS Flows消除了随机演化与效率之间的权衡，结合Feynman-Kac Steering在文本到图像生成中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GLASS Flows为流和扩散模型的推理时扩展提供了一个简单、即插即用的解决方案，显著提升了性能而不牺牲效率。

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved
at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a
major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a
common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many
algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is
significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To
remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that
simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov
transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be
retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the
efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale
text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between
stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS
Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making
it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion
models.

Result: 在生物序列扩散模型的单目标和多目标微调任务中验证了TR2-D2框架的有效性。

Conclusion: TR2-D2为离散序列生成中的可靠奖励引导微调提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising
framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is
optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While
these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from
the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current
fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal
trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion
(TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion
trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware
fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under
a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single-
and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models,
highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided
fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement
learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity,
such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex
algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We
take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of
the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the
critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common
architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that
a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and
a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of
magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds
gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning
rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights,
we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic
algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware
principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55
proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using
significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

TL;DR: SIRI是一种通过交替压缩和扩展推理预算的迭代强化学习方法，能够在大推理模型中实现更高效准确的推理，在保持性能的同时显著减少token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现大推理模型存在重复思维模式，但减少这些模式往往以性能损失为代价。本文旨在克服这种权衡，通过动态调整训练过程中的推理预算来实现性能与效率的平衡。

Method: 采用迭代训练机制，交替进行压缩阶段（减少推理步长，强制模型在有限上下文中做出精确决策）和扩展阶段（放宽长度限制，让模型在长视野设置中探索规划）。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上训练，SIRI-low在AIME24上性能提升43.2%同时token使用减少46.9%；SIRI-high达到所有方法中最高的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过在训练期间周期性振荡大推理模型的输出截断长度，可以动态平衡推理中的探索和效率，收敛到两者之间的最优平衡点。

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了GOAT数据集，包含5.9小时高质量电吉他音频和29.5小时增强数据，使用吉他谱和Guitar Pro格式标注，支持MIDI转录和自动吉他谱转录任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决吉他音乐信息检索领域因数据集稀缺和标注有限而进展受限的问题。

Method: 收集高质量电吉他音频，使用吉他放大器进行数据增强，采用吉他谱和Guitar Pro格式进行标注，并开发文本类标记编码。

Result: 在MIDI转录任务上获得竞争性结果，并在自动吉他谱转录新方法上取得初步成果。

Conclusion: GOAT数据集为吉他相关MIR任务（从合成到转录再到演奏技巧检测）提供了训练新型模型的可能性。

Abstract: In recent years, the guitar has received increased attention from the music
information retrieval (MIR) community driven by the challenges posed by its
diverse playing techniques and sonic characteristics. Mainly fueled by deep
learning approaches, progress has been limited by the scarcity and limited
annotations of datasets. To address this, we present the Guitar On Audio and
Tablatures (GOAT) dataset, comprising 5.9 hours of unique high-quality direct
input audio recordings of electric guitars from a variety of different guitars
and players. We also present an effective data augmentation strategy using
guitar amplifiers which delivers near-unlimited tonal variety, of which we
provide a starting 29.5 hours of audio. Each recording is annotated using
guitar tablatures, a guitar-specific symbolic format supporting string and fret
numbers, as well as numerous playing techniques. For this we utilise both the
Guitar Pro format, a software for tablature playback and editing, and a
text-like token encoding. Furthermore, we present competitive results using
GOAT for MIDI transcription and preliminary results for a novel approach to
automatic guitar tablature transcription. We hope that GOAT opens up the
possibilities to train novel models on a wide variety of guitar-related MIR
tasks, from synthesis to transcription to playing technique detection.

*Ziqi Chen,Gongyu Chen,Yihua Wang,Chaofan Ding,Zihao chen,Wei-Qiang Zhang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: DiaMoE-TTS是一个基于IPA的统一方言TTS框架，通过标准化语音表示和解决字素到音素歧义，使用方言感知的MoE建模音系差异，并采用参数高效的LoRA和条件适配器实现快速方言迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 方言语音蕴含丰富的文化和语言多样性，但构建方言TTS系统面临数据稀缺、拼写不一致和复杂语音变体等挑战。

Method: 基于F5-TTS架构，引入方言感知的混合专家模型(MoE)建模音系差异，使用低秩适配器(LoRA)和条件适配器进行参数高效适配，实现快速迁移到新方言。

Result: 实验表明能够生成自然且富有表现力的语音，在未见过的方言和专门领域（如京剧）上实现零样本性能，仅需几小时数据。

Conclusion: DiaMoE-TTS实现了可扩展的、开放数据驱动的合成，不依赖大规模或专有资源，为方言TTS提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Dialect speech embodies rich cultural and linguistic diversity, yet building
text-to-speech (TTS) systems for dialects remains challenging due to scarce
data, inconsistent orthographies, and complex phonetic variation. To address
these issues, we present DiaMoE-TTS, a unified IPA-based framework that
standardizes phonetic representations and resolves grapheme-to-phoneme
ambiguities. Built upon the F5-TTS architecture, the system introduces a
dialect-aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) to model phonological differences and
employs parameter-efficient adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptors (LoRA) and
Conditioning Adapters for rapid transfer to new dialects. Unlike approaches
dependent on large-scale or proprietary resources, DiaMoE-TTS enables scalable,
open-data-driven synthesis. Experiments demonstrate natural and expressive
speech generation, achieving zero-shot performance on unseen dialects and
specialized domains such as Peking Opera with only a few hours of data.

### [650] [Prompt-aware classifier free guidance for diffusion models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22728)
*Xuanhao Zhang,Chang Li*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种提示感知的指导尺度选择框架，通过预测不同尺度下的生成质量来自动选择最优指导尺度，解决了传统固定尺度方法在不同复杂度提示下泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像和音频生成中取得了显著进展，但分类器自由指导(CFG)的尺度选择问题尚未充分探索。固定尺度无法适应不同复杂度的提示，导致过饱和或弱对齐问题。

Method: 构建大型合成数据集，在多个尺度下生成样本并使用可靠评估指标进行评分。训练轻量级预测器，基于语义嵌入和语言复杂度估计多指标质量曲线，通过带正则化的效用函数确定最佳尺度。

Result: 在MSCOCO 2014和AudioCaps数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比传统CFG在保真度、对齐度和感知偏好方面均有持续改进。

Conclusion: 提示感知的尺度选择为预训练扩散主干提供了有效的、无需训练的性能增强方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in image and audio
generation, largely due to Classifier-Free Guidance. However, the choice of
guidance scale remains underexplored: a fixed scale often fails to generalize
across prompts of varying complexity, leading to oversaturation or weak
alignment. We address this gap by introducing a prompt-aware framework that
predicts scale-dependent quality and selects the optimal guidance at inference.
Specifically, we construct a large synthetic dataset by generating samples
under multiple scales and scoring them with reliable evaluation metrics. A
lightweight predictor, conditioned on semantic embeddings and linguistic
complexity, estimates multi-metric quality curves and determines the best scale
via a utility function with regularization. Experiments on MSCOCO~2014 and
AudioCaps show consistent improvements over vanilla CFG, enhancing fidelity,
alignment, and perceptual preference. This work demonstrates that prompt-aware
scale selection provides an effective, training-free enhancement for pretrained
diffusion backbones.

Motivation: 说话人识别在安全系统、虚拟助手和个性化用户体验中变得越来越重要，需要更有效的损失函数来提高识别准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用基于VGG16的卷积神经网络架构，适应可变大小的mel频谱图输入，实现CosFace Loss和ArcFace Loss两种损失函数，并与Softmax损失函数进行对比分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，与传统的Softmax损失方法相比，使用CosFace Loss和ArcFace Loss获得了更优越的识别准确率。

Conclusion: CosFace Loss和ArcFace Loss在说话人识别任务中表现出比传统Softmax损失更好的性能，这对未来相关研究具有重要意义。

Abstract: Speaker identification has become a crucial component in various
applications, including security systems, virtual assistants, and personalized
user experiences. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of CosFace
Loss and ArcFace Loss for text-independent speaker identification using a
Convolutional Neural Network architecture based on the VGG16 model, modified to
accommodate mel spectrogram inputs of variable sizes generated from the
Voxceleb1 dataset. Our approach involves implementing both loss functions to
analyze their effects on model accuracy and robustness, where the Softmax loss
function was employed as a comparative baseline. Additionally, we examine how
the sizes of mel spectrograms and their varying time lengths influence model
performance. The experimental results demonstrate superior identification
accuracy compared to traditional Softmax loss methods. Furthermore, we discuss
the implications of these findings for future research.

*Goksenin Yuksel,Pierre Guetschel,Michael Tangermann,Marcel van Gerven,Kiki van der Heijden*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: WavJEPA是一种基于原始波形的联合嵌入预测架构，用于通用音频表示学习，显著优于现有时间域音频基础模型，且计算资源需求更低。WavJEPA-Nat是其多通道扩展版本，在嘈杂和混响环境中表现出高度鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从原始波形学习音频表示可以克服基于频谱图的表示学习的关键限制，如频谱图计算的长延迟和相位信息丢失。然而，虽然自监督语音表示学习在波形上取得了显著成功，但这些方法在通用音频表示学习方面尚未达到类似成就。

Method: 提出WavJEPA，一种基于波形的联合嵌入预测架构，利用高级语义表示学习来解决语音单元或标记级表示学习的不足。WavJEPA-Nat是WavJEPA的多通道扩展，在模拟自然场景上训练。

Result: WavJEPA在各种下游基准任务中显著优于最先进的时间域音频基础模型，同时需要更少的计算资源。WavJEPA-Nat对混响和噪声具有高度鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了从原始波形进行通用音频表示学习的可行性和计算效率，展示了低延迟、鲁棒的时间域音频基础模型在现实应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Learning audio representations from raw waveforms overcomes key limitations
of spectrogram-based audio representation learning, such as the long latency of
spectrogram computation and the loss of phase information. Yet, while
self-supervised speech representation learning from raw waveforms has been
remarkably successful, these approaches have not achieved similar feats for
general-purpose audio representation learning from waveforms. Here, we propose
WavJEPA, a waveform-based version of the Joint-Embedding Predictive
Architecture. WavJEPA leverages high-level semantic representation learning to
tackle the shortcomings of representation learning at the speech unit or token
level. We show that this approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain audio foundation models across a wide variety of downstream
benchmark tasks, while requiring considerably fewer computational resources.
Additionally, to overcome the performance drop that time-domain models
typically exhibit in noisy and reverberant real-world acoustic environments, we
present WavJEPA-Nat. WavJEPA-Nat is a multi-channel extension of the WavJEPA
architecture trained on simulated naturalistic scenes. We find that WavJEPA-Nat
is highly robust to reverberation and noise. These results highlight the
feasibility and computational efficiency of general-purpose audio
representation learning from raw waveforms, showcasing the potential for
low-latency, robust time-domain audio foundation models for real-world
applications.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MeanFlowSE是一个单步生成式语音增强框架，通过预测平均速度场实现一步潜在空间优化，使用自监督学习表示而非VAE潜在变量，显著提升推理速度并降低模型复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式语音增强方法依赖多步采样或大语言模型，限制了实时部署。需要开发既能保持高质量又能实现实时处理的解决方案。

Method: 采用MeanFlow预测平均速度场进行一步潜在空间优化，使用自监督学习表示作为条件输入，提供鲁棒的声学语义指导。

Result: 在Interspeech 2020 DNS挑战赛盲测集和模拟测试集上达到SOTA感知质量，具有竞争力的可懂度，同时显著降低实时因子和模型大小。

Conclusion: MeanFlowSE在保持高质量的同时实现了高效的实时处理，适合实际应用部署。

Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) recovers clean speech from noisy signals and is vital
for applications such as telecommunications and automatic speech recognition
(ASR). While generative approaches achieve strong perceptual quality, they
often rely on multi-step sampling (diffusion/flow-matching) or large language
models, limiting real-time deployment. To mitigate these constraints, we
present MeanFlowSE, a one-step generative SE framework. It adopts MeanFlow to
predict an average-velocity field for one-step latent refinement and conditions
the model on self-supervised learning (SSL) representations rather than VAE
latents. This design accelerates inference and provides robust
acoustic-semantic guidance during training. In the Interspeech 2020 DNS
Challenge blind test set and simulated test set, MeanFlowSE attains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) level perceptual quality and competitive
intelligibility while significantly lowering both real-time factor (RTF) and
model size compared with recent generative competitors, making it suitable for
practical use. The code will be released upon publication at
https://github.com/Hello3orld/MeanFlowSE.

### [654] [ABC-Eval: Benchmarking Large Language Models on Symbolic Music Understanding and Instruction Following](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23350)
*Jiahao Zhao,Yunjia Li,Wei Li,Kazuyoshi Yoshii*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: ABC-Eval是首个专注于文本ABC记谱法理解和指令跟随能力的开源基准测试，包含1086个测试样本和10个子任务，评估显示现有LLM在符号音乐处理方面存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展，基于文本的符号音乐任务可行性日益突出，但LLM在符号音乐理解和推理方面的能力仍未充分探索，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 提出ABC-Eval基准测试，涵盖从基础音乐语法理解到复杂序列级推理的10个子任务，共1086个测试样本，评估了7个最先进的LLM。

Result: 评估结果显示现有模型在符号音乐处理能力上存在显著局限性，同时各基线模型在不同子任务上的一致表现支持了基准的可靠性。

Conclusion: ABC-Eval填补了符号音乐理解评估的空白，揭示了LLM在该领域的局限性，为未来研究提供了可靠的基准测试工具。

Abstract: As large language models continue to develop, the feasibility and
significance of text-based symbolic music tasks have become increasingly
prominent. While symbolic music has been widely used in generation tasks, LLM
capabilities in understanding and reasoning about symbolic music remain largely
underexplored. To address this gap, we propose ABC-Eval, the first open-source
benchmark dedicated to the understanding and instruction-following capabilities
in text-based ABC notation scores. It comprises 1,086 test samples spanning 10
sub-tasks, covering scenarios from basic musical syntax comprehension to
complex sequence-level reasoning. Such a diverse scope poses substantial
challenges to models' ability to handle symbolic music tasks. We evaluated
seven state-of-the-art LLMs on ABC-Eval, and the results reveal notable
limitations in existing models' symbolic music processing capabilities.
Furthermore, the consistent performance of individual baselines across
different sub-tasks supports the reliability of our benchmark.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出DTG-VAE方法，通过解耦情感因素来增强说话人聚类性能，特别是在包含情感表达的语音中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度说话人嵌入模型在处理包含情感表达的语音时性能下降，因为情感状态会影响说话人嵌入的有效性。

Method: 基于变分自编码器(VAE)框架，提出DTG-VAE解耦方法，提取更鲁棒的说话人嵌入。

Result: DTG-VAE能够提取更鲁棒的说话人嵌入，显著提升说话人聚类性能。

Conclusion: 情感状态与深度说话人嵌入有效性存在直接关联，DTG-VAE方法能有效解决情感表达对说话人聚类的负面影响。

Abstract: Speaker clustering is the task of identifying the unique speakers in a set of
audio recordings (each belonging to exactly one speaker) without knowing who
and how many speakers are present in the entire data, which is essential for
speaker diarization processes. Recently, off-the-shelf deep speaker embedding
models have been leveraged to capture speaker characteristics. However,
speeches containing emotional expressions pose significant challenges, often
affecting the accuracy of speaker embeddings and leading to a decline in
speaker clustering performance. To tackle this problem, we propose DTG-VAE, a
novel disentanglement method that enhances clustering within a Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) framework. This study reveals a direct link between emotional
states and the effectiveness of deep speaker embeddings. As demonstrated in our
experiments, DTG-VAE extracts more robust speaker embeddings and significantly
enhances speaker clustering performance.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了AudioRole数据集和ARP-Eval评估框架，用于提升LLM的音频角色扮演能力，通过训练GLM-4-Voice模型在声学和内容个性化方面显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注基于文本的角色扮演，而音频角色扮演需要语义内容和声音特征的同步对齐，现有高质量多模态数据集不足。

Method: 从13部电视剧中精心策划AudioRole数据集，包含1000+小时、100万+角色对话，提供同步音频-文本对；提出ARP-Eval双方面评估框架评估响应质量和角色保真度。

Result: 在AudioRole上训练的GLM-4-Voice（ARP-Model）平均声学个性化得分0.31，显著优于原始GLM-4-voice和MiniCPM-O-2.6；内容个性化得分0.36，比未训练模型提升约38%。

Conclusion: AudioRole数据集、6个训练好的ARP-Model和评估协议为音频角色扮演研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: The creation of high-quality multimodal datasets remains fundamental for
advancing role-playing capabilities in large language models (LLMs). While
existing works predominantly focus on text-based persona simulation, Audio
Role-Playing (ARP) presents unique challenges due to the need for synchronized
alignment of semantic content and vocal characteristics. To address this gap,
we propose AudioRole, a meticulously curated dataset from 13 TV series spanning
1K+ hours with 1M+ character-grounded dialogues, providing synchronized
audio-text pairs annotated with speaker identities and contextual metadata. In
addition, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we introduced
ARP-Eval, a dual-aspect evaluation framework that assesses both response
quality and role fidelity. Empirical validation showing GLM-4-Voice trained on
AudioRole (which we called ARP-Model) achieve an average Acoustic
Personalization score of 0.31, significantly outperforming the original
GLM-4-voice and the more powerful model MiniCPM-O-2.6, which specifically
supports role-playing in one-shot scenarios. The ARP-Model also achieves a
Content Personalization score of 0.36, surpassing the untrained original model
by about 38% and maintaining the same level as MiniCPM-O-2.6.
  AudioRole features dialogues from over 115 main characters, 6 trained
ARP-Models that role-play different characters, and evaluation protocols.
Together, they provide an essential resource for advancing audio-grounded
role-playing research.

*Kai Li,Kejun Gao,Xiaolin Hu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的视听语音分离方法Dolphin，通过轻量级视觉编码器和音频分离器，在保持高质量分离的同时显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视听语音分离方法参数量大、计算成本高，在许多应用中作为预处理步骤时不可接受，需要开发更高效的解决方案。

Method: 开发了DP-LipCoder双路径轻量级视频编码器将唇部运动转换为离散音频对齐语义标记，构建了包含全局-局部注意力块的轻量级编码器-解码器分离器。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，Dolphin不仅超越了当前最先进模型的分离质量，还实现了显著效率提升：参数量减少50%以上，MACs减少2.4倍以上，GPU推理速度提升6倍以上。

Conclusion: Dolphin为现实场景中的高性能视听语音分离提供了一个实用且可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-visual speech separation (AVSS) methods leverage visual cues to extract
target speech and have demonstrated strong separation quality in noisy acoustic
environments. However, these methods usually involve a large number of
parameters and require high computational cost, which is unacceptable in many
applications where speech separation serves as only a preprocessing step for
further speech processing. To address this issue, we propose an efficient AVSS
method, named Dolphin. For visual feature extraction, we develop DP-LipCoder, a
dual-path lightweight video encoder that transforms lip-motion into discrete
audio-aligned semantic tokens. For audio separation, we construct a lightweight
encoder-decoder separator, in which each layer incorporates a global-local
attention (GLA) block to efficiently capture multi-scale dependencies.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets showed that Dolphin not only surpassed
the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in separation quality but also
achieved remarkable improvements in efficiency: over 50% fewer parameters, more
than 2.4x reduction in MACs, and over 6x faster GPU inference speed. These
results indicate that Dolphin offers a practical and deployable solution for
high-performance AVSS in real-world scenarios. Our code and demo page are
publicly available at http://cslikai.cn/Dolphin/.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出IB-CAAN方法用于语音深度伪造检测，通过置信度引导的对抗对齐和信息瓶颈技术，在多个基准测试中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经语音合成技术产生了高度逼真的语音深度伪造，带来重大安全风险。由于欺骗方法的分布偏移以及说话人、信道和录音条件的变异性，语音深度伪造检测具有挑战性。

Method: 提出信息瓶颈增强的置信度感知对抗网络（IB-CAAN）。置信度引导的对抗对齐自适应地抑制攻击特定伪影而不消除判别性线索，信息瓶颈则去除干扰变异性以保留可转移特征。

Result: 在ASVspoof 2019/2021、ASVspoof 5和In-the-Wild数据集上的实验表明，IB-CAAN始终优于基线方法，并在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: IB-CAAN通过共享判别性特征学习为鲁棒检测提供了一条有效路径，在语音深度伪造检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Neural speech synthesis techniques have enabled highly realistic speech
deepfakes, posing major security risks. Speech deepfake detection is
challenging due to distribution shifts across spoofing methods and variability
in speakers, channels, and recording conditions. We explore learning shared
discriminative features as a path to robust detection and propose Information
Bottleneck enhanced Confidence-Aware Adversarial Network (IB-CAAN).
Confidence-guided adversarial alignment adaptively suppresses attack-specific
artifacts without erasing discriminative cues, while the information bottleneck
removes nuisance variability to preserve transferable features. Experiments on
ASVspoof 2019/2021, ASVspoof 5, and In-the-Wild demonstrate that IB-CAAN
consistently outperforms baseline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
many benchmarks.

*Junyou Wang,Zehua Chen,Binjie Yuan,Kaiwen Zheng,Chang Li,Yuxuan Jiang,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出了AudioMoG混合引导框架，结合不同引导原则的优势，在保持推理效率的同时提升跨模态音频生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有引导方法通常只依赖单一原则（如CFG的条件对齐或AG的分数准确性），未能充分发挥引导在音频生成中的潜力

Method: 设计混合引导框架AudioMoG，利用不同引导原则的互补优势，实现累积效益。简化形式可考虑并行互补或恢复单一原则

Result: 在相同推理速度下，AudioMoG在T2A生成中始终优于单一引导方法，同时在V2A、文本到音乐和图像生成中也显示出优势

Conclusion: 当前跨模态音频生成系统存在'免费午餐'：通过采样阶段混合引导原则可在不牺牲推理效率的情况下获得更高质量

Abstract: Guidance methods have demonstrated significant improvements in cross-modal
audio generation, including text-to-audio (T2A) and video-to-audio (V2A)
generation. The popularly adopted method, classifier-free guidance (CFG),
steers generation by emphasizing condition alignment, enhancing fidelity but
often at the cost of diversity. Recently, autoguidance (AG) has been explored
for audio generation, encouraging the sampling to faithfully reconstruct the
target distribution and showing increased diversity. Despite these advances,
they usually rely on a single guiding principle, e.g., condition alignment in
CFG or score accuracy in AG, leaving the full potential of guidance for audio
generation untapped. In this work, we explore enriching the composition of the
guidance method and present a mixture-of-guidance framework, AudioMoG. Within
the design space, AudioMoG can exploit the complementary advantages of
distinctive guiding principles by fulfilling their cumulative benefits. With a
reduced form, AudioMoG can consider parallel complements or recover a single
guiding principle, without sacrificing generality. We experimentally show that,
given the same inference speed, AudioMoG approach consistently outperforms
single guidance in T2A generation across sampling steps, concurrently showing
advantages in V2A, text-to-music, and image generation. These results highlight
a "free lunch" in current cross-modal audio generation systems: higher quality
can be achieved through mixed guiding principles at the sampling stage without
sacrificing inference efficiency. Demo samples are available at:

TL;DR: 提出了VioPTT模型，这是一个轻量级的端到端模型，能够直接转录小提琴演奏技巧以及音高起始和结束时间。同时发布了MOSA-VPT数据集，这是一个高质量的小提琴演奏技巧合成数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动音乐转录模型大多仅限于转录音高和时序信息，忽略了重要的表达性和乐器特定的细微差别，特别是小提琴演奏技巧这种赋予其独特音色和情感影响的关键元素。

Method: 开发了VioPTT模型，这是一个轻量级的端到端模型，能够联合转录小提琴演奏技巧以及音高信息。利用新发布的MOSA-VPT合成数据集进行训练，避免了手动标注的需求。

Result: 该模型在真实世界的小提琴演奏技巧录音中表现出强大的泛化能力，并达到了最先进的转录性能。

Conclusion: VioPTT是首个将小提琴转录和演奏技巧预测结合在统一框架中的模型，为音乐转录领域提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: While automatic music transcription is well-established in music information
retrieval, most models are limited to transcribing pitch and timing information
from audio, and thus omit crucial expressive and instrument-specific nuances.
One example is playing technique on the violin, which affords its distinct
palette of timbres for maximal emotional impact. Here, we propose
\textbf{VioPTT} (Violin Playing Technique-aware Transcription), a lightweight,
end-to-end model that directly transcribes violin playing technique in addition
to pitch onset and offset. Furthermore, we release \textbf{MOSA-VPT}, a novel,
high-quality synthetic violin playing technique dataset to circumvent the need
for manually labeled annotations. Leveraging this dataset, our model
demonstrated strong generalization to real-world note-level violin technique
recordings in addition to achieving state-of-the-art transcription performance.
To our knowledge, VioPTT is the first to jointly combine violin transcription
and playing technique prediction within a unified framework.

Conclusion: 提出的带有局部属性的适配器方法能够有效解决语音情感识别中的迁移学习问题，实现了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing speech emotion recognition (SER) methods commonly suffer from the
lack of high-quality large-scale corpus, partly due to the complex,
psychological nature of emotion which makes accurate labeling difficult and
time consuming. Recently, transfer learning based methods that exploit the
encoders pretrained on large-scale speech corpus (e.g., Wav2Vec2.0 and HuBERT)
have shown strong potential for downstream SER tasks. However, task-specific
fine-tuning remains necessary for various conversational scenarios of different
topics, speakers and languages to achieve satisfactory performance. It
generally requires costly encoder retraining for individual SER tasks. To
address this issue, we propose to train an adapter with local attributes for
efficient transfer learning. Specifically, a weighted average
pooling-Transformer (WAP-Transformer) is proposed as a lightweight backbone to
enrich the frame-level representation. An adapter with teacher-student branches
is exploited for task-agnostic transfer learning, where the student branch is
jointly optimized via mask prediction and self-distillation objectives, and the
teacher branch is obtained online from the student via exponential moving
average (EMA). Meanwhile, local attributes are learned from the teacher branch
via unsupervised clustering, which aims to act as a universal model that
provides additional semantic-rich supervisions. A statistical attentive pooling
(SAP) module is proposed to obtain utterance representation for fine-tuning. To
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed adapter with local attributes,
extensive experiments have been conducted on IEMOCAP. Superior performance has
been reported, compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods in similar
settings.

Result: 在客观和主观评估中，该框架在EPR和APT任务上取得有竞争力的性能，实现了有效的内容-风格解耦、可靠的风格迁移和风格合适的渲染。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架成功联合建模了表达性演奏渲染和自动钢琴转录，实现了内容与风格的有效分离和灵活的风格控制。

Abstract: Expressive performance rendering (EPR) and automatic piano transcription
(APT) are fundamental yet inverse tasks in music information retrieval: EPR
generates expressive performances from symbolic scores, while APT recovers
scores from performances. Despite their dual nature, prior work has addressed
them independently. In this paper we propose a unified framework that jointly
models EPR and APT by disentangling note-level score content and global
performance style representations from both paired and unpaired data. Our
framework is built on a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture and
is trained using only sequence-aligned data, without requiring fine-grained
note-level alignment. To automate the rendering process while ensuring
stylistic compatibility with the score, we introduce an independent
diffusion-based performance style recommendation module that generates style
embeddings directly from score content. This modular component supports both
style transfer and flexible rendering across a range of expressive styles.
Experimental results from both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate
that our framework achieves competitive performance on EPR and APT tasks, while
enabling effective content-style disentanglement, reliable style transfer, and
stylistically appropriate rendering. Demos are available at

TL;DR: UniFlow-Audio是一个基于流匹配的统一音频生成框架，通过双融合机制处理时间对齐和非时间对齐任务，在7个任务上取得优异性能，仅使用不到8K小时公开数据和10亿参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频生成研究将任务分为时间对齐和非时间对齐两类，采用不同建模范式。但音频本身没有这种分类，需要一个统一模型来实现通用音频生成。

Method: 提出基于流匹配的统一框架，采用双融合机制：时间对齐音频潜在特征，通过交叉注意力整合非时间对齐特征。使用任务平衡数据采样，支持文本、音频、视频多模态输入。

Result: 在7个任务上取得强劲结果，仅使用不到8K小时公开训练数据和10亿可训练参数。即使是只有约2亿参数的小型变体也表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: UniFlow-Audio展示了作为音频生成非自回归基础模型的潜力，通过多任务学习和流匹配的生成建模能力实现统一音频生成。

Abstract: Audio generation, including speech, music and sound effects, has advanced
rapidly in recent years. These tasks can be divided into two categories:
time-aligned (TA) tasks, where each input unit corresponds to a specific
segment of the output audio (e.g., phonemes aligned with frames in speech
synthesis); and non-time-aligned (NTA) tasks, where such alignment is not
available. Since modeling paradigms for the two types are typically different,
research on different audio generation tasks has traditionally followed
separate trajectories. However, audio is not inherently divided into such
categories, making a unified model a natural and necessary goal for general
audio generation. Previous unified audio generation works have adopted
autoregressive architectures, while unified non-autoregressive approaches
remain largely unexplored. In this work, we propose UniFlow-Audio, a universal
audio generation framework based on flow matching. We propose a dual-fusion
mechanism that temporally aligns audio latents with TA features and integrates
NTA features via cross-attention in each model block. Task-balanced data
sampling is employed to maintain strong performance across both TA and NTA
tasks. UniFlow-Audio supports omni-modalities, including text, audio, and
video. By leveraging the advantage of multi-task learning and the generative
modeling capabilities of flow matching, UniFlow-Audio achieves strong results
across 7 tasks using fewer than 8K hours of public training data and under 1B
trainable parameters. Even the small variant with only ~200M trainable
parameters shows competitive performance, highlighting UniFlow-Audio as a
potential non-auto-regressive foundation model for audio generation. Code and
models will be available at https://wsntxxn.github.io/uniflow_audio.

Motivation: 传统音频到音频方法缺乏可解释性，音乐制作人需要能够理解和调整的具体参数值，而非黑箱处理

Method: 使用钢琴录音数据集，系统性地改变EQ设置，评估回归模型和神经网络模型在预测EQ频段增益方面的表现

Result: 神经网络在多频段任务上达到0.0216的均方误差，能够准确预测EQ参数设置

Conclusion: 该系统为音乐制作人提供了实用、灵活且自动化的音色匹配工具，并为扩展到更复杂音频效果奠定了基础

Abstract: This project presents an AI-based system for tone replication in music
production, focusing on predicting EQ parameter settings directly from audio
features. Unlike traditional audio-to-audio methods, our approach outputs
interpretable parameter values (e.g., EQ band gains) that musicians can further
adjust in their workflow. Using a dataset of piano recordings with
systematically varied EQ settings, we evaluate both regression and neural
network models. The neural network achieves a mean squared error of 0.0216 on
multi-band tasks. The system enables practical, flexible, and automated tone
matching for music producers and lays the foundation for extensions to more
complex audio effects.

Abstract: The generation of musically coherent and aesthetically pleasing harmony
remains a significant challenge in the field of algorithmic composition. This
paper introduces an innovative Agentic AI-enabled Higher Harmony Music
Generator, a multi-agent system designed to create harmony in a collaborative
and modular fashion. Our framework comprises four specialized agents: a
Music-Ingestion Agent for parsing and standardizing input musical scores; a
Chord-Knowledge Agent, powered by a Chord-Former (Transformer model), to
interpret and provide the constituent notes of complex chord symbols; a
Harmony-Generation Agent, which utilizes a Harmony-GPT and a Rhythm-Net (RNN)
to compose a melodically and rhythmically complementary harmony line; and an
Audio-Production Agent that employs a GAN-based Symbolic-to-Audio Synthesizer
to render the final symbolic output into high-fidelity audio. By delegating
specific tasks to specialized agents, our system effectively mimics the
collaborative process of human musicians. This modular, agent-based approach
allows for robust data processing, deep theoretical understanding, creative
composition, and realistic audio synthesis, culminating in a system capable of
generating sophisticated and contextually appropriate higher-voice harmonies
for given melodies.

Motivation: 探索音乐表示模型是否在无意中编码了文化偏见，特别是非音乐属性（如性别和语言）对流派表示的影响。

Method: 使用概念激活向量(CAVs)分析四个最先进的模型（MERT、Whisper、MuQ、MuQ-MuLan），采用STraDa数据集并平衡训练集以控制流派混杂因素。

Result: 发现了显著的模型特定偏见，与MIR和音乐社会学中报告的差异一致，并证明通过概念向量操作的后处理去偏策略可以有效减轻这些偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了偏见感知模型设计的必要性，并表明概念化可解释性方法为诊断和减轻MIR中的表示偏见提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Music representation models are widely used for tasks such as tagging,
retrieval, and music understanding. Yet, their potential to encode cultural
bias remains underexplored. In this paper, we apply Concept Activation Vectors
(CAVs) to investigate whether non-musical singer attributes - such as gender
and language - influence genre representations in unintended ways. We analyze
four state-of-the-art models (MERT, Whisper, MuQ, MuQ-MuLan) using the STraDa
dataset, carefully balancing training sets to control for genre confounds. Our
results reveal significant model-specific biases, aligning with disparities
reported in MIR and music sociology. Furthermore, we propose a post-hoc
debiasing strategy using concept vector manipulation, demonstrating its
effectiveness in mitigating these biases. These findings highlight the need for
bias-aware model design and show that conceptualized interpretability methods
offer practical tools for diagnosing and mitigating representational bias in
MIR.

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督机器学习算法，从符号音乐数据中识别重复模式（称为“音乐词”），通过两阶段EM框架构建音乐词典并重建音乐数据，在人类专家标注上达到0.61 IoU分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐中的重复模式反映了作曲的认知过程，但由于音乐解释的语义模糊性，提取这些模式具有挑战性。

Method: 将音乐词发现建模为统计优化问题，采用两阶段EM学习框架：1. 开发音乐词词典；2. 重建音乐数据。

Result: 在人类专家标注评估中达到0.61 IoU分数，表明最小化编码长度能有效解决语义模糊性。

Conclusion: 该方法使计算机能够从音乐数据中提取基本构建块，支持AI音乐任务和音乐学分析，揭示了人类优化编码系统塑造音乐语义的原理。

Abstract: This paper presents an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that
identifies recurring patterns -- referred to as ``music-words'' -- from
symbolic music data. These patterns are fundamental to musical structure and
reflect the cognitive processes involved in composition. However, extracting
these patterns remains challenging because of the inherent semantic ambiguity
in musical interpretation. We formulate the task of music-word discovery as a
statistical optimization problem and propose a two-stage
Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based learning framework: 1. Developing a
music-word dictionary; 2. Reconstructing the music data. When evaluated against
human expert annotations, the algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union
(IoU) score of 0.61. Our findings indicate that minimizing code length
effectively addresses semantic ambiguity, suggesting that human optimization of
encoding systems shapes musical semantics. This approach enables computers to
extract ``basic building blocks'' from music data, facilitating structural
analysis and sparse encoding. The method has two primary applications. First,
in AI music, it supports downstream tasks such as music generation,
classification, style transfer, and improvisation. Second, in musicology, it
provides a tool for analyzing compositional patterns and offers insights into
the principle of minimal encoding across diverse musical styles and composers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统判别式特征直接优化后验概率，强调语义抽象但丢失细粒度细节；而音频生成模型天然编码了时空感知（捕捉局部声学纹理）和语义先验（知道生成什么），探索这两种互补优势的融合。

Method: 系统研究生成式和判别式特征的差异与互补关系，提出有效的融合策略。

Result: 在声音事件分类、标记和细粒度音频描述等多个任务上的实验显示一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为音频表示学习引入了新视角，强调生成-判别互补性可以为音频理解提供详细感知和语义意识。

Abstract: This work pioneers the utilization of generative features in enhancing audio
understanding. Unlike conventional discriminative features that directly
optimize posterior and thus emphasize semantic abstraction while losing fine
grained details, audio generation models inherently encode both spatiotemporal
perception (capturing local acoustic texture across time and frequency) and
semantic prior (knowing what to generate). It motivates us to explore the
bridge of these complementary strengths. We provide a systematic investigation
of their differences and complementary relationships, and ultimately propose an
effective fusion strategy. Experiments across multiple tasks, including sound
event classification, tagging, and particularly the fine grained task of audio
captioning, demonstrate consistent performance gains. Beyond empirical
improvements, this work more importantly introduces a new perspective on audio
representation learning, highlighting that generative discriminative
complementarity can provide both detailed perception and semantic awareness for
audio understanding.

TL;DR: VoxCPM提出了一种无需分词器的TTS模型，通过分层语义-声学建模和半离散残差表示解决了语音合成中离散性与表达性的权衡问题，在1.8百万小时双语语料上训练，实现了最先进的零样本TTS性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音合成中离散标记保证稳定性但牺牲表达性，而连续信号保留声学丰富性但存在误差累积的问题，避免依赖预训练语音分词器造成的语义-声学分离。

Method: 引入可微分量化瓶颈实现自然专业化：文本语义语言模型生成语义-韵律规划，残差声学模型恢复细粒度声学细节，使用局部扩散解码器生成高保真语音潜在表示，端到端训练。

Result: VoxCPM-0.5B模型在零样本TTS任务中达到开源系统中最先进性能，能够理解文本并推断生成适当的韵律和风格，提供上下文感知的表达性和自然流畅度。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分层语义-声学表示实现了表达性和稳定的语音合成，消除了对外部语音分词器的依赖，模型已开源供社区使用。

Abstract: Generative models for speech synthesis face a fundamental trade-off: discrete
tokens ensure stability but sacrifice expressivity, while continuous signals
retain acoustic richness but suffer from error accumulation due to task
entanglement. This challenge has driven the field towards multi-stage pipelines
that rely on pre-trained speech tokenizers, but these create a
semantic-acoustic divide, limiting holistic and expressive speech generation.
We resolve these dilemma through hierarchical semantic-acoustic modeling with
semi-discrete residual representations and present a novel tokenizer-free TTS
model VoxCPM. Our framework introduces a differentiable quantization bottleneck
that induces natural specialization: a Text-Semantic Language Model (TSLM)
generates semantic-prosodic plans, while a Residual Acoustic Model (RALM)
recovers fine-grained acoustic details. This hierarchical semantic-acoustic
representation guides a local diffusion-based decoder to generate high-fidelity
speech latents. Critically, the entire architecture is trained end-to-end under
a simple diffusion objective, eliminating dependency on external speech
tokenizers. Trained on a massive 1.8 million hours of bilingual corpus, our
VoxCPM-0.5B model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS performance among
open-source systems, demonstrating that our approach delivers expressive and
stable synthesis. Besides, VoxCPM shows the capability to comprehend text to
infer and generate appropriate prosody and style, delivering speech with
context-aware expressiveness and natural flow. To facilitate community-driven
research and development, VoxCPM is publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

Method: 采用稀疏自编码器分析预训练模型的隐藏表示，以歌唱技巧分类作为案例研究。

Result: SAE能保留原始表示和类别标签信息，增强声乐属性的解耦，是识别表示中编码基础因素的有效工具。

Conclusion: 稀疏自编码器是分析自监督学习系统内部结构的有力工具，能提供对预训练模型表示机制的深入理解。

Abstract: Audio pretrained models are widely employed to solve various tasks in speech
processing, sound event detection, or music information retrieval. However, the
representations learned by these models are unclear, and their analysis mainly
restricts to linear probing of the hidden representations. In this work, we
explore the use of Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze the hidden
representations of pretrained models, focusing on a case study in singing
technique classification. We first demonstrate that SAEs retain both
information about the original representations and class labels, enabling their
internal structure to provide insights into self-supervised learning systems.
Furthermore, we show that SAEs enhance the disentanglement of vocal attributes,
establishing them as an effective tool for identifying the underlying factors
encoded in the representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动鼓转录(ADT)最多只能处理5类鼓声，而鼓声分离模型可分离6类以上鼓声，结合两者可提高转录的真实性。

Method: 使用简单的后处理步骤，将5类转录输出扩展到7类，并基于分离的鼓声干估计MIDI力度值。

Result: 与8类鼓转录基线相比表现出色，产生适合MIR或音乐制作任务的逼真MIDI转录。

Conclusion: 结合鼓转录和鼓声分离工具能有效提升鼓转录的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: Automatic Drum Transcription (ADT) remains a challenging task in MIR but
recent advances allow accurate transcription of drum kits with up 5 classes -
kick, snare, hi-hats, toms and cymbals - via the ADTOF package. In addition,
several drum kit \emph{stem} separation models in the open source community
support separation for more than 6 stem classes, including distinct crash and
ride cymbals. In this work we explore the benefits of combining these tools to
improve the realism of drum transcriptions. We describe a simple
post-processing step which expands the transcription output from five to seven
classes and furthermore, we are able to estimate MIDI velocity values based on
the separated stems. Our solution achieves strong performance when assessed
against a baseline of 8-class drum transcription and produces realistic MIDI
transcriptions suitable for MIR or music production tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种二值化原型探针方法，解决了音频自监督学习中全局池化造成的信息瓶颈问题，使探针评估成为比微调更高效的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频自监督学习默认使用微调评估，但全局池化导致线性探针无法准确表征嵌入质量，因为CLS标记丢弃了多标签音频中分散的局部事件信息。

Method: 引入二值化原型探针：一种轻量级池化方法，通过学习原型进行类别级信息聚合，克服全局池化的信息瓶颈。

Result: 在13个数据集和6种基于频谱图的编码器上的综合基准测试表明，该方法显著优于线性和注意力探针。

Conclusion: 该工作确立了探针作为评估音频SSL模型的竞争性高效范式，挑战了对昂贵微调的依赖。

Abstract: Although probing frozen models has become a standard evaluation paradigm,
self-supervised learning in audio defaults to fine-tuning. A key reason is that
global pooling creates an information bottleneck causing linear probes to
misrepresent the embedding quality: The $\texttt{cls}$-token discards crucial
token information about dispersed, localized events in multi-label audio. This
weakness is rooted in the mismatch between the pretraining objective (operating
globally) and the downstream task (localized events). Across a comprehensive
benchmark of 13 datasets and 6 spectrogram-based encoders, we first investigate
the global pooling bottleneck. We then introduce binarized prototypical probes:
a lightweight and simple pooling method that learns prototypes to perform
class-wise information aggregation. Despite its simplicity, our method notably
outperforms linear and attentive probing. Our work establishes probing as a
competitive and efficient paradigm for evaluating audio SSL models, challenging
the reliance on costly fine-tuning.

Abstract: Randomness plays a pivotal yet paradoxical role in computational music
creativity: it can spark novelty, but unchecked chance risks incoherence. This
paper presents a thematic review of contemporary AI music systems, examining
how designers incorporate randomness and uncertainty into creative practice. I
draw on the concept of structured uncertainty to analyse how stochastic
processes are constrained within musical and interactive frameworks. Through a
comparative analysis of six systems - Musika (Pasini and Schl\"uter, 2022),
MIDI-DDSP (Wu et al., 2021), Melody RNN (Magenta Project), RAVE (Caillon and
Esling, 2021), Wekinator (Fiebrink and Cook, 2010), and Somax 2 (Borg, 2019) -
we identify recurring design patterns that support musical coherence, user
control, and co-creativity. To my knowledge, this is the first thematic review
examining randomness in AI music through structured uncertainty, offering
practical insights for designers and artists aiming to support expressive,
collaborative, or improvisational interactions.

Motivation: 解决传统级联管道中语音合成孤立的问题，实现端到端的多模态理解和可控的个性化长时程语音生成。

Method: 采用双轨令牌架构，包含统一训练策略和双音频编码器设计，以及基于分块的并行解码方案来缩小文本-语音令牌率差距。

Result: 在保持音色一致性、生成自然上下文感知语音以及长格式音频和多模态理解方面优于现有开源模型，且训练数据效率显著更高。

Conclusion: MGM-Omni为多模态理解和可控个性化长时程语音生成建立了高效端到端的新范式。

Abstract: We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and
expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that
isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a "brain-mouth" design with a
dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal
reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient
cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For
understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder
design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions.
For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech
token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice
cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent
work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient
training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing
open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences,
producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form
audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient,
end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised
long-horizon speech generation.

Conclusion: 通过集成PACE模块的VC模型能够有效提升韵律控制能力，同时保持说话人音色，在多个评估指标上超越基线系统。

Abstract: Recent advances in discrete audio codecs have significantly improved speech
representation modeling, while codec language models have enabled in-context
learning for zero-shot speech synthesis. Inspired by this, we propose a voice
conversion (VC) model within the VALLE-X framework, leveraging its strong
in-context learning capabilities for speaker adaptation. To enhance prosody
control, we introduce a prosody-aware audio codec encoder (PACE) module, which
isolates and refines prosody from other sources, improving expressiveness and
control. By integrating PACE into our VC model, we achieve greater flexibility
in prosody manipulation while preserving speaker timbre. Experimental
evaluation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline VC
systems in prosody preservation, timbre consistency, and overall naturalness,
surpassing baseline VC systems.

selects a strategy, interacts with the environment and other agents, and
subsequently updates its strategy based on the received payoff. This process
generates a sequence of joint strategies $(s^t)_{t \geq 0}$, where $s^t$
represents the strategy profile of all agents at time step $t$. A widely
adopted principle in MARL algorithms is "win-stay, lose-shift", which dictates
that an agent retains its current strategy if it achieves the best response.
This principle exhibits a fixed-point property when the joint strategy has
become an equilibrium. The sequence of joint strategies under this principle is
referred to as a satisficing path, a concept first introduced in [40] and
explored in the context of $N$-player games in [39]. A fundamental question
arises regarding this principle: Under what conditions does every initial joint
strategy $s$ admit a finite-length satisficing path $(s^t)_{0 \leq t \leq T}$
where $s^0=s$ and $s^T$ is an equilibrium? This paper establishes a sufficient
condition for such a property, and demonstrates that any finite-state Markov
game, as well as any $N$-player game, guarantees the existence of a
finite-length satisficing path from an arbitrary initial strategy to some
equilibrium. These results provide a stronger theoretical foundation for the
design of MARL algorithms.

*SeungHyun Yi,Seungjun Yi*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 开发了一个结合GTO防御和实时剥削的扑克模型，在单挑和多玩家情况下都能超越纯GTO策略以最大化利润


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯GTO策略只能避免损失但不能保证最大利润，需要开发能超越GTO并利用对手弱点的模型

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛反事实遗憾最小化(CFR)方法，先通过自我对弈建立接近理论最优的基线策略，然后观察对手行为并调整策略进行实时剥削

Result: CFR在单挑情况下表现最佳，在大多数多玩家情况下也保持最强方法地位

Conclusion: 通过结合GTO的防御优势和实时剥削能力，扑克智能体可以从仅仅不输转变为持续赢利

Abstract: Game theory has grown into a major field over the past few decades, and poker
has long served as one of its key case studies. Game-Theory-Optimal (GTO)
provides strategies to avoid loss in poker, but pure GTO does not guarantee
maximum profit. To this end, we aim to develop a model that outperforms GTO
strategies to maximize profit in No Limit Holdem, in heads-up (two-player) and
multi-way (more than two-player) situations. Our model finds the GTO foundation
and goes further to exploit opponents. The model first navigates toward many
simulated poker hands against itself and keeps adjusting its decisions until no
action can reliably beat it, creating a strong baseline that is close to the
theoretical best strategy. Then, it adapts by observing opponent behavior and
adjusting its strategy to capture extra value accordingly. Our results indicate
that Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) performs best in
heads-up situations and CFR remains the strongest method in most multi-way
situations. By combining the defensive strength of GTO with real-time
exploitation, our approach aims to show how poker agents can move from merely
not losing to consistently winning against diverse opponents.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了进化超博弈中策略集的演化动态，发现在存在信息不对称的情况下，会出现与传统进化博弈不同的复杂相态，包括孤独者主导、多策略集共存等，且理性增强能显著促进合作行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实社会中个体存在知识和信息获取的不对称性，传统进化博弈理论假设所有玩家都能完全访问策略空间，这与实际情况不符。超博弈模型能更好地反映这种认知和信息约束导致的异质性。

Method: 使用原型模型，包含合作、背叛和孤独者三种策略，形成类似石头剪刀布的循环支配关系。研究覆盖了混合良好和空间格点种群，分析进化超博弈动态中的策略集学习和演化。

Result: 发现了与传统进化博弈不同的复杂相态：孤独者主导、多策略集共存、合作与孤独者组合主导等。特别值得注意的是，理性增强显著促进了合作行为。

Conclusion: 进化超博弈模型能更真实地反映现实社会中的信息不对称性，揭示了在这种不对称条件下策略演化的复杂动态，其中理性水平对合作行为的促进具有重要作用。

Abstract: In the realm of evolutionary game theory, standard frameworks typically
presuppose that every player possesses comprehensive knowledge and unrestricted
access to the entire strategy space. However, real-world human society
inherently harbors diverse levels of knowledge, experience, and background
among individuals. Hypergames incorporate this heterogeneity by permitting
individuals to differ in their access to the full strategy set, reflecting
cognitive or informational constraints and giving rise to asymmetric strategic
interactions. Yet, their evolutionary consequences remain underexplored. Our
inquiry employs prototype models featuring three available strategies, focusing
on social dilemmas involving cooperation, defection, and loner. These
strategies manifest cyclic dominance, akin to the well-studied
rock-paper-scissors dynamics, a foundational model in game theory. Our study
spans both well-mixed and spatial lattice populations, delving into the
intricacies of learning and evolution of the strategy set within the
evolutionary hypergame dynamics. In stark contrast to traditional evolutionary
game dynamics, our findings unveil nuanced and intricate phases, encompassing
scenarios of loner dominance, coexistence of multiple strategy sets,
combinations of cooperation and loner dominance, and more. Remarkably, we
discern that heightened rationality significantly promotes cooperative
behaviors.

TL;DR: 研究时间敏感卖家向策略性买家销售过期票券的最优动态定价问题，解决卖家急于销售与买家等待降价之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过期票券的销售面临一个核心矛盾：卖家因时间压力需要降价促销，但这会激励买家等待更低价格。需要找到能解决这一冲突的最优定价策略。

Method: 引入基于价值的阈值(VBT)策略，将买家的二维类型(估值和到达时间)解耦，通过常微分方程证明均衡存在性并提供构造性表征方法。

Result: 针对两种典型市场提出近似最优定价策略：薄市场中采用恒定价格，厚市场中采用线性折扣。数值分析验证了这些基准策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 厚市场或高时间敏感性的卖家适合线性折扣策略，薄市场中恒定价格能消除买家等待动机。对于耐心的卖家，准拍卖式定价(高价维持后急剧下降)最能有效聚集需求。

Abstract: We study the optimal dynamic pricing of an expiring ticket or voucher, sold
by a time-sensitive seller to strategic buyers who arrive stochastically with
private values. The expiring nature creates a conflict: the seller's urgency to
sell before expiration drives price reductions, which in turn incentivize
buyers to wait. We seek the seller's optimal pricing policy that resolves this
tension. The main analytical challenge is that buyer type is two-dimensional
(valuation and arrival time), which makes equilibrium intractable under general
strategies. To address this, we introduce the Value-Based Threshold (VBT)
strategy, a tractable framework that decouples these two dimensions. Using this
framework, we prove equilibrium existence via an ordinary differential equation
and provide a constructive procedure for its characterization. We then derive
near-optimal pricing policies for two stylized regimes: a constant price in
thin markets and a linear discount in thick markets. Numerical frontier
analysis confirms these benchmarks and shows how optimal policy adapts as the
seller's time sensitivity changes. Our findings clarify the conflict between
quick sales and strategic waiting. Sellers facing thick markets or high time
sensitivity benefit from linear discounts, while in thin markets a constant
price neutralizes buyers' incentive to wait. We also show this simple policy
remains robust across broad conditions. For patient sellers, a quasi-auction
schedule that maintains a high price until a sharp final drop is most effective
in aggregating demand.

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: 本文研究手术室部门的多智能体调度问题，提出一种分支定价算法来寻找最优纳什均衡解，平衡手术组长和个体外科医生的目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术室调度中，手术组长分配时间块给个体外科医生，而个体外科医生独立规划手术案例，这可能导致手术组长期望的调度质量下降。需要找到既能优化手术组长目标，又能确保个体外科医生无法在分配时间内改进自身目标的均衡解。

Method: 提出专用的分支定价算法，通过在外科医生特定定价问题中添加惰性约束，确保获得最优双层可行解。这种方法尊重个体外科医生的目标需求，并能高效搜索解空间。

Result: 通过计算实验验证了所提算法及其专用组件的性能，并通过计算稳定性代价和去中心化代价，提供了在不同场景下获得均衡解的益处分析。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决手术室多智能体调度问题，在尊重个体外科医生目标的同时优化手术组长的全局目标，实现了高效的均衡解搜索。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a multi-agent scheduling problem for organising the
operations within the operating room department. The head of the surgeon group
and individual surgeons are together responsible for the surgeon schedule and
surgical case planning. The surgeon head allocates time blocks to individual
surgeons, whereas individual surgeons determine the planning of surgical cases
independently, which might degrade the schedule quality envisaged by the
surgeon head. The bilevel optimisation under study seeks an optimal Nash
equilibrium solution -- a surgeon schedule and surgical case plan that optimise
the objectives of the surgeon head, while ensuring that no individual surgeon
can improve their own objective within the allocated time blocks. We propose a
dedicated branch-and-price that adds lazy constraints to the formulation of
surgeon-specific pricing problems to ensure an optimal bilevel feasible
solution is retrieved. In this way, the surgeon head respects the objective
requirements of the individual surgeons and the solution space can be searched
efficiently. In the computational experiments, we validate the performance of
the proposed algorithm and its dedicated components and provide insights into
the benefits of attaining an equilibrium solution under different scenarios by
calculating the price of stability and the price of decentralisation.

### [681] [The Free Option Problem of ePBS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24849)
*Bruno Mazorra,Burak Öz,Christoph Schlegel,Fei Wu*

Main category: cs.GT

TL;DR: Ethereum的Glamsterdam升级引入ePBS机制，虽然解决了信任和可扩展性问题，但带来了新的活跃性风险：构建者获得了一个短期"免费"期权，可以在不承担额外惩罚的情况下阻止其承诺的执行负载成为规范，导致空块问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ePBS机制中构建者免费期权对网络活跃性的影响，特别是在高波动性时期这种风险会显著增加，影响用户交易的及时执行。

Method: 通过理论分析和历史数据实证研究，分析期权价值与市场波动性、期权窗口长度、区块价值来源等因素的关系，并评估缓解策略的效果。

Result: 理论预测显示期权价值和行权概率随市场波动性、期权窗口长度和外部信号价值占比增加而增长。实证表明平均只有0.82%的区块会行权，但在高波动日可达6%，依赖CEX-DEX套利的构建者更可能行权。

Conclusion: 缓解策略（缩短期权窗口或惩罚行权行为）能有效降低活跃性风险，这对于以太坊进一步扩展和吸引更多流动性至关重要。

Abstract: Ethereum's upcoming Glamsterdam upgrade introduces EIP-7732 enshrined
Proposer--Builder Separation (ePBS), which improves the block production
pipeline by addressing trust and scalability challenges. Yet it also creates a
new liveness risk: builders gain a short-dated ``free'' option to prevent the
execution payload they committed to from becoming canonical, without incurring
an additional penalty. Exercising this option renders an empty block for the
slot in question, thereby degrading network liveness.
  We present the first systematic study of the free option problem. Our
theoretical results predict that option value and exercise probability grow
with market volatility, the length of the option window, and the share of block
value derived from external signals such as external market prices. The
availability of a free option will lead to mispricing and LP losses. The
problem would be exacerbated if Ethereum further scales and attracts more
liquidity. Empirical estimates of values and exercise probabilities on
historical blocks largely confirm our theoretical predictions. While the option
is rarely profitable to exercise on average (0.82\% of blocks assuming an
8-second option time window), it becomes significant in volatile periods,
reaching up to 6\% of blocks on high-volatility days -- precisely when users
most require timely execution.
  Moreover, builders whose block value relies heavily on CEX-DEX arbitrage are
more likely to exercise the option. We demonstrate that mitigation strategies
-- shortening the option window or penalizing exercised options -- effectively
reduce liveness risk.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车载云计算(VCC)虽然概念上有吸引力，但缺乏在真实场景中证明其盈利性和环境优势的定量证据，阻碍了其采用。

Method: 提出了一个联合建模延迟、能耗、货币激励和碳排放的管理框架，包括最大化利益相关者效用的任务分配策略和基于联盟博弈理论的动态收益分配机制。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方法支持低延迟任务执行，有效货币化车辆资源，相比传统边缘基础设施减少99%以上的CO2排放。

Conclusion: VCC可以成为边缘计算的一个实用且可持续的替代方案，同时实现盈利性和环境可持续性。

Abstract: Vehicular Cloud Computing (VCC) leverages the idle computing capacity of
vehicles to execute end-users' offloaded tasks without requiring new
computation infrastructure. Despite its conceptual appeal, VCC adoption is
hindered by the lack of quantitative evidence demonstrating its profitability
and environmental advantages in real-world scenarios. This paper tackles the
fundamental question: Can VCC be both profitable and sustainable? We address
this problem by proposing a management scheme for VCC that combines
energy-aware task allocation with a game-theoretic revenue-sharing mechanism.
Our framework is the first to jointly model latency, energy consumption,
monetary incentives, and carbon emissions within urban mobility and 5G
communication settings. The task allocation strategy maximizes the aggregate
stakeholder utility while satisfying deadlines and minimizing energy costs. The
payoffs are distributed via a coalitional game theory adapted to dynamic
vehicular environments, to prevent disincentivizing participants with
potentially negative contributions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our
approach supports low-latency task execution, enables effective monetization of
vehicular resources, and reduces CO2 emissions by more than 99% compared to
conventional edge infrastructures, making VCC a practical and sustainable
alternative to edge computing.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了三种经典匹配问题中的流行匹配概念，提出了流行获胜集作为流行匹配的松弛形式，并计算了各种设置下的流行维度（最小流行获胜集大小）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于流行匹配通常不存在，需要研究一种自然的松弛形式——流行获胜集，即一组匹配的集合，在与其他任何匹配的成对选举中能获得多数票。

Method: 通过分析三种经典匹配问题（房屋分配问题、婚姻问题、室友问题），在不同设置下（加权/非加权代理、严格/允许平局的偏好）计算流行维度。

Result: 房屋分配问题的流行维度恰好为2；婚姻问题和室友问题的流行维度在2到3之间；在非加权且严格偏好的特殊情况下，婚姻问题的流行维度为1，室友问题为2。

Conclusion: 流行维度为理解匹配问题的稳定性提供了新的视角，不同问题设置下的流行维度存在显著差异，这有助于设计更稳健的匹配机制。

Abstract: We study popular matchings in three classical settings: the house allocation
problem, the marriage problem, and the roommates problem. In the popular
matching problem, (a subset of) the vertices in a graph have preference
orderings over their potential matches. A matching is popular if it gets a
plurality of votes in a pairwise election against any other matching.
Unfortunately, popular matchings typically do not exist. So we study a natural
relaxation, namely popular winning sets which are a set of matchings that
collectively get a plurality of votes in a pairwise election against any other
matching. The $\textit{popular dimension}$ is the minimum cardinality of a
popular winning set, in the worst case over the problem class.
  We prove that the popular dimension is exactly $2$ in the house allocation
problem, even if the voters are weighted and ties are allowed in their
preference lists. For the marriage problem and the roommates problem, we prove
that the popular dimension is between $2$ and $3$, when the agents are weighted
and/or their preferences orderings allow ties. In the special case where the
agents are unweighted and have strict preference orderings, the popular
dimension of the marriage problem is known to be exactly $1$ and we prove the
popular dimension of the roommates problem is exactly $2$.

Abstract: 6G wireless networks aim to exploit semantic awareness to optimize radio
resources. By optimizing the transmission through the lens of the desired goal,
the energy consumption of transmissions can also be reduced, and the latency
can be improved. To that end, this paper investigates a paradigm in which the
capabilities of generative AI (GenAI) on the edge are harnessed for network
optimization. In particular, we investigate an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
handover framework that takes advantage of GenAI and semantic communication to
maintain reliable connectivity. To that end, we propose a framework in which a
lightweight MobileBERT language model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), is deployed on the UAV. This model processes multi-attribute flight and
radio measurements and performs multi-label classification to determine
appropriate handover action. Concurrently, the model identifies an appropriate
set of contextual "Reason Tags" that elucidate the decision's rationale. Our
model, evaluated on a rule-based synthetic dataset of UAV handover scenarios,
demonstrates the model's high efficacy in learning these rules, achieving high
accuracy in predicting the primary handover decision. The model also shows
strong performance in identifying supporting reasons, with an F1 micro-score of
approximately 0.9 for reason tags.

Motivation: 经典最优速度模型存在不现实的加速度预测问题，需要开发一个既能保持交通波不稳定性机制，又能确保加速度有界的物理基础模型。

Method: 将最优速度模型与基于牛顿力学的阻力饱和定律结合，用有界加速度的公式替代线性松弛定律，推导色散关系并进行线性稳定性分析。

Result: OVD模型保持了导致走走停停波的不稳定性机制，同时避免了经典OVM的不现实加速度预测，为大规模交通仿真和实证研究提供了基础。

Conclusion: OVD模型通过有界加速度保持了经典最优速度模型的非线性不稳定性，为交通流研究提供了物理基础和可解释性框架。

Abstract: We develop a Hybrid Optimal Velocity-Drag (OVD) model that combines the
behavioral structure of the classical Optimal Velocity Model (OVM) with a
drag-based saturation law motivated by Newtonian mechanics. The model retains
the OVM principle that desired speed depends on headway, but replaces the
linear relaxation law with a formulation that enforces bounded accelerations
and smooth convergence to equilibrium. After reviewing the OVM framework and
its stability properties, we introduce the OVD dynamics and derive the
dispersion relation from a linear stability analysis of uniform flow. This
analysis shows that the OVD formulation preserves the instability mechanisms
responsible for stop-and-go waves, while avoiding the unrealistic acceleration
predictions of the classical OVM. We also illustrate the model using desired
velocity functions of hyperbolic tangent type, a common choice in the OVM
literature, and highlight applications to large-scale traffic simulation and
empirical data studies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the OVD
model enforces bounded accelerations while preserving the nonlinear
instabilities of the classical OVM, providing a physically grounded and
interpretable foundation for advancing traffic flow research.

Abstract: A full power flow (PF) model is a complete representation of the physical
power network. Traditional model-based methods rely on the full PF model to
implement power flow analysis. In practice, however, some PF model parameters
can be inaccurate or even unavailable due to the uncertainties or dynamics in
the power systems. Moreover, because the power network keeps evolving with
possibly changing topology, the generalizability of a PF model to different
network sizes and typologies should be considered. In this paper, we propose a
PF rebuild model based on graph attention networks (GAT) by constructing a new
graph based on the real and imaginary parts of voltage at each bus. By
comparing with two state-of-the-art PF rebuild models for different standard
IEEE power system cases and their modified topology variants, we demonstrate
the feasibility of our method. Experimental results show that our proposed
model achieves better accuracy for a changing network and can generalize to
different networks with less accuracy discount.

Abstract: Real world evolves in continuous time but computations are done from finite
samples. Therefore, we study algorithms using finite observations in
continuous-time linear dynamical systems. We first study the system
identification problem, and propose a first non-asymptotic error analysis with
finite observations. Our algorithm identifies system parameters without needing
integrated observations over certain time intervals, making it more practical
for real-world applications. Further we propose a lower bound result that shows
our estimator is provably optimal up to constant factors. Moreover, we apply
the above algorithm to online control regret analysis for continuous-time
linear system. Our system identification method allows us to explore more
efficiently, enabling the swift detection of ineffective policies. We achieve a
regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ over a single $T$-time horizon in a
controllable system, requiring only $\mathcal{O}(T)$ observations of the
system.

Abstract: Addressing the uncertainty introduced by increasing renewable integration is
crucial for secure power system operation, yet capturing it while preserving
the full nonlinear physics of the grid remains a significant challenge. This
paper presents a stochastic security constrained optimal power flow model with
chance constraints supporting nonlinear AC power flow equations and non
Gaussian uncertainties. We use general polynomial chaos expansion to model
arbitrary uncertainties of finite variance, enabling accurate moment
computations and robust prediction of system states across diverse operating
scenarios. The chance constraints probabilistically limit inequality
violations, providing a more flexible representation of controllable variables
and the consequent power system operation. Case studies validate the proposed
models effectiveness in satisfying operational constraints and capturing
uncertainty with high fidelity. Compared to the deterministic formulation, it
also uncovers a wider set of unsecure contingencies, highlighting improved
uncertainty capture and operational insight.

Abstract: The capacity market provides economic guidance for generation investment and
ensures the adequacy of generation capability for power systems. With the
rapidly increasing proportion of renewable energy, the adequacy of flexibility
and resilience becomes more crucial for the secure operation of power systems.
In this context, this paper incorporates the flexibility and resilience demand
into the capacity market by formulating the capacity demand curves for ramping
capability, inertia and recovery capabilities besides the generation
capability. The guidance on generation investment of the capacity market is
also taken into account by solving the generation investment equilibrium among
generation companies with a Nash Cournot model employing an equivalent
quadratic programming formulation. The overall problem is established as a
trilevel game and an iterative algorithm is devised to formulate the capacity
demand curves in the upper level based on Genco's investment acquired from the
middle and lower levels. The case study further demonstrates that to
incorporate flexibility and resilience demand into the capacity market could
stimulate proper generation investment and ensure the adequacy of flexibility
and resilience in power systems.

Conclusion: IA-LBE方法为传递函数无法显式表达的电磁系统提供了一种有效的灵敏度分析工具，能够可靠地确定系统响应的性能边界。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for the sensitivity analysis of
electromagnetic (EM) systems whose transfer function (TF), that is the
input-output (I/O) relationship between the input parameters affected by
tolerance and the system response (i.e., the arising EM performance of
interest), is not available in closed (or explicit) form. The method is a
generalized analytic technique based on the Interval Analysis (IA). First, an
analytic surrogate model (SM) of the TF is defined by means of a
learning-by-example (LBE) approach starting from a set of available I/O
examples. Then, the LBE-derived SM is extended to intervals through IA to yield
inclusive, yet finite, performance bounds of the output system response when
the control parameters are affected by unknown, but bounded, tolerances. A set
of representative numerical examples is reported to validate the proposed
IA-LBE method as well as to assess its effectiveness and reliability when
dealing with realistic EM systems (e.g., antennas) for which the TF is not
explicitly known.

Abstract: Machine learning has become a fundamental approach for modeling, prediction,
and control, enabling systems to learn from data and perform complex tasks.
Reservoir computing is a machine learning tool that leverages high-dimensional
dynamical systems to efficiently process temporal data for prediction and
observation tasks. Traditionally, the connectivity of a reservoir computer (RC)
is generated at random, lacking a principled design. Here, we focus on
optimizing the topology of a linear RC to improve its performance and
interpretability, which we achieve by decoupling the RC dynamics into a number
of independent modes. We then proceed to optimize each one of these modes to
perform a given task, which corresponds to selecting an optimal RC connectivity
in terms of a given set of eigenvalues of the RC adjacency matrix. Simulations
on networks of varying sizes show that the optimized RC significantly
outperforms randomly constructed reservoirs in both the training and testing
phases and also often surpasses nonlinear reservoirs of comparable size. This
approach provides both practical performance advantages and theoretical
guidelines for designing efficient, task-specific, and analytically transparent
RC architectures.

Conclusion: 所提出的风险约束设计不仅能有效应对大通信延迟，还能同样有效地解决其他通信问题和网络扰动，提高了广域阻尼控制的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Non-ideal communication links, especially delays, critically affect fast
networked controls in power systems, such as the wide-area damping control
(WADC). Traditionally, a delay estimation and compensation approach is adopted
to address this cyber-physical coupling, but it demands very high accuracy for
the fast WADC and cannot handle other cyber concerns like link failures or
{cyber perturbations}. Hence, we propose a new risk-constrained framework that
can target the communication delays, yet amenable to general uncertainty under
the cyber-physical couplings. Our WADC model includes the synchronous
generators (SGs), and also voltage source converters (VSCs) for additional
damping capabilities. To mitigate uncertainty, a mean-variance risk constraint
is introduced to the classical optimal control cost of the linear quadratic
regulator (LQR). Unlike estimating delays, our approach can effectively
mitigate large communication delays by improving the worst-case performance. A
reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm, namely, stochastic
gradient-descent with max-oracle (SGDmax), is developed to solve the
risk-constrained problem. We further show its guaranteed convergence to
stationarity at a high probability, even using the simple zero-order policy
gradient (ZOPG). Numerical tests on the IEEE 68-bus system not only verify
SGDmax's convergence and VSCs' damping capabilities, but also demonstrate that
our approach outperforms conventional delay compensator-based methods under
estimation error. While focusing on performance improvement under large delays,
our proposed risk-constrained design can effectively mitigate the worst-case
oscillations, making it equally effective for addressing other communication
issues and cyber perturbations.

Abstract: For electrifying the transportation sector, deploying a strategically planned
and efficient charging infrastructure is essential. This paper presents a
two-phase approach for electric vehicle (EV) charger deployment that integrates
spatial point-of-interest analysis and maximum coverage optimization over an
integrated spatial power grid. Spatial-focused studies in the literature often
overlook electrical grid constraints, while grid-focused work frequently
considers statistically modeled EV charging demand. To address these gaps, a
new framework is proposed that combines spatial network planning with
electrical grid considerations. This study approaches EV charger planning from
a perspective of the distribution grid, starting with an estimation of EV
charging demand and the identification of optimal candidate locations. It
ensures that the capacity limits of newly established chargers are maintained
within the limits of the power grid. This framework is applied in a test case
for the Dallas area, integrating the existing EV charger network with an
8500-bus distribution system for comprehensive planning.

Abstract: Electric vehicles and renewable energy systems need batteries that charge
quickly, last many years and still store a lot of energy, but current
chemistries struggle to deliver all three. Inspired by electric fish that
deliver bursts of current and birds that sleep with half their brains, we
propose a hybrid battery concept called SwiftPulse. It combines sodium-ion
cells that provide energy with niobium-oxide cells that accept high-power
pulses. A pulse-based charger and a battery-management strategy rotate clusters
of cells into rest so they can recover. We derive simple models of energy
density, diffusion and capacity fade to show that a pack made mostly of
sodium-ion modules with a smaller fraction of niobium-oxide modules could
exceed 175 Wh per kg, endure more than ten thousand charge-discharge cycles and
recharge to eighty percent in less than ten minutes. Simulations suggest that
pulsed charging reduces ion buildup at the surface and slows degradation. We
outline a roadmap for cell-level and module-level experiments and suggest
integrating machine learning to adapt pulse parameters and rest scheduling. By
blending ideas from biology, electrochemistry and data-driven control, this
work points toward batteries that are safer, faster to charge and longer
lasting.

Motivation: 传统方程自由方法依赖精细尺度模拟器作为黑盒时间步进器，但重复模拟计算成本高昂，且微观时间步进器可能不可用，只有数据可用。

Method: 使用在时空微观/介观数据上训练的局部神经算子获得高效短时解算子，结合Krylov子空间方法计算粗粒度稳态和非稳态，提供无矩阵Jacobian信息。

Conclusion: 该方法为无法获得显式粗粒度方程的高维分布式参数系统提供了一种有效的数据驱动控制替代方案。

Abstract: The control of high-dimensional distributed parameter systems (DPS) remains a
challenge when explicit coarse-grained equations are unavailable. Classical
equation-free (EF) approaches rely on fine-scale simulators treated as
black-box timesteppers. However, repeated simulations for steady-state
computation, linearization, and control design are often computationally
prohibitive, or the microscopic timestepper may not even be available, leaving
us with data as the only resource. We propose a data-driven alternative that
uses local neural operators, trained on spatiotemporal microscopic/mesoscopic
data, to obtain efficient short-time solution operators. These surrogates are
employed within Krylov subspace methods to compute coarse steady and
unsteady-states, while also providing Jacobian information in a matrix-free
manner. Krylov-Arnoldi iterations then approximate the dominant eigenspectrum,
yielding reduced models that capture the open-loop slow dynamics without
explicit Jacobian assembly. Both discrete-time Linear Quadratic Regulator
(dLQR) and pole-placement (PP) controllers are based on this reduced system and
lifted back to the full nonlinear dynamics, thereby closing the feedback loop.

Abstract: Heat pumps have the capability for fast adjustments in power consumption with
potential connections to large heating-inertia district heating networks, and
are thus a very important resource for providing frequency support in
low-inertia power systems. Nevertheless, the coupling of power networks with
district heating systems renders the underlying dynamics much more involved. It
is therefore important to ensure that system stability and appropriate power
sharing are maintained. In this paper, we consider the problem of leveraging
district heating systems as ancillary services for primary frequency control in
power networks via heat pumps. We propose a novel power sharing scheme for
heating systems based on the average temperature. This enables an optimal power
allocation among diverse energy sources without requiring load disturbances
information. We then discuss two approaches for heating systems to contribute
to frequency regulation in power networks. We show that both approaches ensure
stability in the combined heat and power network and facilitate optimal power
allocation among the different energy sources. We also discuss how various
generation dynamics can be incorporated into our framework with guaranteed
stability and optimality. Finally, we conduct simulations that demonstrate
various tradeoffs in the transient response and the practical potential of the
proposed approaches.

Conclusion: 所提出的制导律能够有效处理多个防御者的对抗环境，通过几何方式表征威胁并确保拦截器安全，同时考虑输入约束保持系统稳定性。

Abstract: This paper presents an input-constrained nonlinear guidance law to address
the problem of intercepting a stationary target in contested environments with
multiple defending agents. Contrary to prior approaches that rely on explicit
knowledge of defender strategies or utilize conservative safety conditions
based on a defender's range, our work characterizes defender threats
geometrically through engagement zones that delineate inevitable interception
regions. Outside these engagement zones, the interceptor remains invulnerable.
The proposed guidance law switches between a repulsive safety maneuver near
these zones and a pursuit maneuver outside their influence. To deal with
multiple engagement zones, we employ a smooth minimum function
(log-sum-exponent approximation) that aggregates threats from all the zones
while prioritizing the most critical threats. Input saturation is modeled and
embedded in the non-holonomic vehicle dynamics so the controller respects
actuator limits while maintaining stability. Numerical simulations with several
defenders demonstrate the proposed method's ability to avoid engagement zones
and achieve interception across diverse initial conditions.

Abstract: Rising global energy demand from population growth raises concerns about the
sustainability of fossil fuels. Consequently, the energy sector has
increasingly transitioned to renewable energy sources like solar and wind,
which are naturally abundant. However, the periodic and unpredictable nature of
these resources pose significant challenges for power system reliability.
Accurate forecasting is essential to ensure grid stability and optimize energy
management. But due to the high variability in weather conditions which
directly affected wind and solar energy, achieving precise predictions remains
difficult. Advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly in
Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL), offer promising solutions to
improve forecasting accuracy. The study highlights three widely used algorithms
for solar and wind energy prediction: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Random
Forest (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). These models are capable
of learning complex patterns from historical and environmental data, enabling
more accurate forecasts and contributing to the enhanced efficiency and
reliability of renewable energy systems. This review aims to provide an
overview on RF, XGBoost, and LSTM by conducting a comparative analysis across
three essential criteria: research prevalence, model complexity, and
computational execution time.

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is widely used for controlling
high-speed robotic systems such as quadrotors. However, its significant
computational demands often hinder real-time feasibility and reliability,
particularly in environments requiring robust obstacle avoidance. This paper
proposes a novel SDC-Based Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, which
preserves the high-precision performance of NMPC while substantially reducing
computational complexity by over 30%. By reformulating the nonlinear quadrotor
dynamics through the State-Dependent Coefficient (SDC) method, the original
nonlinear program problem is transformed into a sequential quadratic
optimization problem. The controller integrates an integral action to eliminate
steady-state tracking errors and imposes constraints for safety-critical
obstacle avoidance. Additionally, a disturbance estimator is incorporated to
enhance robustness against external perturbations. Simulation results
demonstrate that the SDC-Based MPC achieves comparable tracking accuracy to
NMPC, with greater efficiency in terms of computation times, thereby improving
its suitability for real-time applications. Theoretical analysis further
establishes the stability and recursive feasibility of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: 基于模型的先验正则化方法能有效解决多智能体强化学习中的不稳定问题，保证局部指数收敛到近似纳什均衡。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) optimizes strategic interactions in
non-cooperative dynamic games, where agents have misaligned objectives.
However, data-driven methods such as multi-agent policy gradients (MA-PG) often
suffer from instability and limit-cycle behaviors. Prior stabilization
techniques typically rely on entropy-based exploration, which slows learning
and increases variance. We propose a model-based approach that incorporates
approximate priors into the reward function as regularization. In linear
quadratic (LQ) games, we prove that such priors stabilize policy gradients and
guarantee local exponential convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium. We
then extend this idea to infinite-horizon nonlinear games by introducing
Multi-agent Guided Policy Search (MA-GPS), which constructs short-horizon local
LQ approximations from trajectories of current policies to guide training.
Experiments on nonlinear vehicle platooning and a six-player strategic
basketball formation show that MA-GPS achieves faster convergence and more
stable learning than existing MARL methods.

Result: 证明了在𝒦-PL条件和全局Lipschitz连续梯度下，随机梯度动力学具有小协方差NSS，轨迹以高概率收敛到最优解邻域；强化的𝒦∞-PL条件导致NSS，弱化的正定PL条件导致积分NSS。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为随机梯度系统的鲁棒性分析提供了理论基础，并成功应用于线性二次调节器(LQR)和逻辑回归的策略优化分析中。

Abstract: This paper studies gradient dynamics subject to additive random noise, which
may arise from sources such as stochastic gradient estimation, measurement
noise, or stochastic sampling errors. To analyze the robustness of such
stochastic gradient systems, the concept of small-covariance noise-to-state
stability (NSS) is introduced, along with a Lyapunov-based characterization.
Furthermore, the classical Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition on the objective
function is generalized to the $\mathcal{K}$-PL condition via comparison
functions, thereby extending its applicability to a broader class of
optimization problems. It is shown that the stochastic gradient dynamics
exhibit small-covariance NSS if the objective function satisfies the
$\mathcal{K}$-PL condition and possesses a globally Lipschitz continuous
gradient. This result implies that the trajectories of stochastic gradient
dynamics converge to a neighborhood of the optimum with high probability, with
the size of the neighborhood determined by the noise covariance. Moreover, if
the $\mathcal{K}$-PL condition is strengthened to a $\mathcal{K}_\infty$-PL
condition, the dynamics are NSS; whereas if it is weakened to a general
positive-definite-PL condition, the dynamics exhibit integral NSS. The results
further extend to objectives without globally Lipschitz gradients through
appropriate step-size tuning. The proposed framework is further applied to the
robustness analysis of policy optimization for the linear quadratic regulator
(LQR) and logistic regression.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel coverage control algorithm for multi-agent
systems, where each agent has no prior knowledge of the specific region to be
covered. The proposed method enables agents to autonomously detect the target
area and collaboratively achieve full coverage. Once an agent detects a part of
the target region within its sensor range, a dynamically constructed density
function is generated to attract nearby agents. By integrating this
density-driven mechanism with Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT), the agents
are guided to achieve optimal spatial distribution. Additionally, Control
Barrier Functions (CBFs) are employed to ensure collision avoidance and
maintain non-overlapping sensor coverage, enhancing both safety and efficiency.
Simulation results verify that agents can independently locate and effectively
cover the target area.

constraints based on the graph's spectral properties, complicating the design
of the coupling gains. This challenge intensifies for large-scale systems with
diverse graph Laplacian spectra. The proposed approach reformulates the dynamic
consensus problem with a prescribed convergence rate using a state-action value
function framework inspired by optimal control theory. Specifically, a
synthetic linear quadratic regulation (LQR) formulation is introduced to encode
the consensus objective, enabling its translation into a convex semidefinite
programming (SDP) problem. The resulting SDP is applicable in both model-based
and model-free settings for jointly designing the local feedback and coupling
gains. To handle the inherent non-convex feasibility conditions, a
convex-concave decomposition strategy is employed. Adaptation of the method in
a completely model-free set-up eliminates the need for system identification or
knowledge of the agents' dynamics. Instead, it relies on input-state data
collection and offers an entirely data-driven equivalent SDP formulation.
Finally, a new algorithm balancing feasibility, convergence rate, robustness,
and energy efficiency, is established to provide design flexibility. Numerical
simulations validate the method's effectiveness in various scenarios.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了分数阶微分方程周期解的稳定性，提出了Liouville-Weyl型FODEs框架以支持精确周期解，并分析了将Floquet理论和Hill矩阵方法扩展到分数阶系统的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典Caputo型分数阶微分方程不支持精确周期解，因此需要开发新的框架来研究分数阶系统的周期解稳定性。

Method: 提出Liouville-Weyl型FODEs作为Caputo型方程的扩展，支持精确周期解；通过局部线性化得到线性时变分数阶微分方程，并尝试扩展Floquet理论和Hill矩阵方法。

Result: 发现扩展的Floquet理论只能评估LTP-FODEs的指数增长解，无法处理衰减解；在时不变情况下也证实了这一局限性。

Conclusion: 分数阶系统的Floquet理论存在根本性限制，只能分析指数增长行为，无法处理代数衰减解，这一局限性在时变和时不变系统中都存在。

Abstract: This paper explores stability properties of periodic solutions of (nonlinear)
fractional-order differential equations (FODEs). As classical Caputo-type FODEs
do not admit exactly periodic solutions, we propose a framework of
Liouville-Weyl-type FODEs, which do admit exactly periodic solutions and are an
extension of Caputo-type FODEs. Local linearization around a periodic solution
results in perturbation dynamics governed by a linear time-periodic
differential equation. In the classical integer-order case, the perturbation
dynamics is therefore described by Floquet theory, i.e. the exponential growth
or decay of perturbations is expressed by Floquet exponents which can be
assessed using the Hill matrix approach. For fractional-order systems, however,
a rigorous Floquet theory is lacking. Here, we explore the limitations when
trying to extend Floquet theory and the Hill matrix method to linear
time-periodic fractional-order differential equations (LTP-FODEs) as local
linearization of nonlinear fractional-order systems. A key result of the paper
is that such an extended Floquet theory can only assess exponentially growing
solutions of LTP-FODEs. Moreover, we provide an analysis of linear
time-invariant fractional-order systems (LTI-FODEs) with algebraically decaying
solutions and show that the inaccessibility of decaying solutions through
Floquet theory is already present in the time-invariant case.

Conclusion: 基于耗散性的层次化控制方法能有效确保传播网络的稳定、耗散和网格稳定，为大规模复杂网络的控制提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Analyzing and controlling spreading processes are challenging problems due to
the involved non-linear node (subsystem) dynamics, unknown disturbances,
complex interconnections, and the large-scale and multi-level nature of the
problems. The dissipativity concept provides a practical framework for
addressing such concerns, thanks to the energy-based representation it offers
for subsystems and the compositional properties it provides for the analysis
and control of interconnected (networked) systems comprised of such subsystems.
Therefore, in this paper, we utilize the dissipativity concept to analyze and
control a spreading process that occurs over a hierarchy of nodes, groups, and
a network (i.e., a spreading network). We start by generalizing some existing
results on dissipativity-based topology design for networked systems. Next, we
model the considered spreading network as a networked system and establish the
dissipativity properties of its nodes. The generalized topology design method
is then applied at multiple levels of the considered spreading network to
formulate its analysis and control problems as Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI)
problems. We identify and enforce localized necessary conditions to support the
feasibility of the LMI problem solved at each subsequent hierarchical level of
the spreading network. Consequently, the proposed method does not involve
iterative multi-level optimization stages that are computationally inefficient.
The proposed control solution ensures that the spreading network is not only
stable but also dissipative and mesh-stable. Compared to conventional methods,
such as threshold pruning and high-degree edge removal, our approach offers
superior performance in terms of infection containment, control efficiency, and
disturbance robustness. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed technique.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于UWB的群体优化定位方法，利用所有节点间距离来提高定位精度，相比传统的三边测量方法有显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统UWB定位方法采用星型拓扑，忽略了节点间距离信息。群体拓扑能提供更多冗余距离估计，提高定位精度和一致性。现有研究缺乏对测量误差如何影响最终定位结果的分析。

Method: 提出UWB群体优化定位方法，利用所有可用的节点间距离。使用合成UWB数据进行验证，测试各种输入误差情况，并进行全面的误差敏感性分析。

Result: 在现实UWB距离输入估计下，提出方法的定位误差约为5.7厘米。在高噪声条件下，提出方法的误差比三边测量方法低约6厘米（三边测量误差约19厘米）。

Conclusion: 群体优化定位方法比传统星型三边测量方法更准确和一致，展示了其在定位估计中的普遍潜力。

Abstract: Ultra-wideband (UWB) is a promising technology for indoor position estimation
for various localization applications of object swarms, such as in 3D analysis
of human movement with multiple on-body sensors or a swarm of drones in an
indoor environment. However, most UWB-only position estimation methods are
based on a star topology, where the position of a mobile node is estimated
using distances from several fixed anchors. These approaches ignore the
valuable inter-node distance estimates, possible in a fully-connected 'Swarm'
topology, which could provide more redundancy in the set of available distance
estimates used for the position estimation. This would improve the accuracy and
consistency of the position estimates. Also, published studies do not analyze
how input measurement errors affect the final position estimates, which makes
it difficult to assess the reliability under varying conditions. Therefore,
this study first proposes a UWB swarm optimization-based position estimation
method that utilizes all available internode distances to enhance accuracy and
compare against the traditional trilateration method that utilizes the star
configuration. All validations were done with synthetic UWB data, to enable
testing all input error situations. The comprehensive error sensitivity
analysis was conducted to evaluate its robustness under varying noise
conditions. The proposed method consistently outperformed trilateration, with
position estimation error around 5.7 cm for realistic UWB distance input
estimates, while for higher noise conditions, the proposed method had errors
around 6 cm lower than the trilateration method, which had position estimation
errors around 19 cm. This study demonstrates the general potential of the Swarm
optimization-based method for position estimation as a more accurate and
consistent alternative to traditional star-based trilateration methods.

Result: 建立了相对于周期控制的理论性能界限，证明了闭环系统的稳定性，并通过数值示例验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效平衡控制性能和执行频率，在保证系统稳定性的同时减少执行次数。

Abstract: This paper presents a controller design method aiming to balance control
performance and actuation frequency. In this framework, actuation timings are
determined in an event-driven manner, resulting in intermittent control
actions. Control performance is measured by an infinite-horizon average cost,
and input sparsity is promoted through actuation-rate regularization. Since the
formulated optimal control problem has a combinatorial nature, we employ a
rollout algorithm to find a suboptimal solution. In the proposed scheme, the
event-triggering condition is derived through a multistage minimization
procedure using a receding-horizon approach. We establish theoretical
performance bounds with respect to periodic control and prove the stability of
the closed-loop system. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
demonstrated through a numerical example.

TL;DR: 本文比较了电力系统中协调规划与顺序规划两种方法，发现在PJM区域模型中，协调规划方法能减少67%的输电升级需求，总系统成本降低0.6%，同时保持相似的可靠性和气候目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前美国系统运营商通常采用顺序规划方法，先确定发电和储能容量，再根据现有电网进行调度模拟来识别输电约束。这种方法可能无法准确捕捉发电、储能和输电之间的相互作用。

Method: 开发了一个多阶段、多位置的规划模型，能够同时优化发电、储能和输电投资，同时满足可靠性约束以及州级能源和气候政策。使用PJM区域20区模型进行测试。

Result: 在保守模型规范下，协调规划方法估计的输电升级需求比顺序模型低67%，总系统成本降低0.6%，同时保持相似的可靠性和气候结果。敏感性分析显示协调规划能带来更大的输电和成本节约以及可靠性和气候效益。

Conclusion: 协调规划方法比传统的顺序规划方法更有效，能够显著降低输电升级需求和系统成本，同时满足可靠性和气候目标。

Abstract: Coordinated planning of generation, storage, and transmission more accurately
captures the interactions among these three capacity types necessary to meet
electricity demand, at least in theory. However, in practice, U.S. system
operators typically follow a sequential planning approach: They first determine
future generation and storage additions based on an assumed unconstrained
(`copper plate') system. Next, they perform dispatch simulations of this
projected generation and storage capacity mix on the existing transmission grid
to identify transmission constraint violations. These violations indicate the
need for transmission upgrades. We describe a multistage, multi-locational
planning model that co-optimizes generation, storage, and transmission
investments. The model respects reliability constraints as well as state energy
and climate policies. We test the two planning approaches using a current
stakeholder-informed 20-zone model of the PJM region, developed for the current
FERC Order No. 1920 compliance filing process. In our most conservative model
specification, we find that the co-optimized approach estimates 67% lower
transmission upgrade needs than the sequential model, leading to total system
costs that are .6% lower and similar reliability and climate outcomes. Our
sensitivities show larger transmission and cost savings and reliability and
climate benefits from co-optimized planning.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别向量场，为变步长线性多步方法提供理论保证，但完整证明需待期刊版本

Abstract: We study the identification of continuous-time vector fields from irregularly
sampled trajectories. We introduce Spectral Flow Learning (SFL), which learns
in a windowed flow space using a lag-linear label operator that aggregates
lagged Koopman actions. We provide finite-sample high-probability (FS-HP)
guarantees for the class of variable-step linear multistep methods (vLLM). The
FS-HP rates are constructed using spectral regularization with
qualification-controlled filters for flow predictors under standard source and
filter assumptions. A multistep observability inequality links flow error to
vector-field error and yields two-term bounds that combine a statistical rate
with an explicit discretization bias from vLMM theory.
  This preliminary preprint states the results and sketches proofs, with full
proofs and extensions deferred to a journal version.

Abstract: This paper details the implementation and experimental validation of a

Instruments TMS320F28379D microcontroller. The system integrates pulse-width
modulation (PWM) generation, analog-to-digital conversion (ADC),
digital-to-analog conversion (DAC), and quadrature encoder feedback to
facilitate precise control under various strategies. A current sensing solution
based on the AMC1301 isolation amplifier and shunt resistor ensures accurate

parameter tuning and data visualization are achieved using GUI Composer,
enabling efficient system debugging and interaction. Experimental results
demonstrate smooth speed reversal, fast dynamic response, and stable
performance under both step and multi-step inputs. While GUI Composer
effectively supports general monitoring and control, limitations in signal

confirm the robustness and effectiveness of the implemented control strategies
for high-performance induction motor applications.

Conclusion: 该方法计算效率高，适用于嵌入式应用，能够防止意外系统故障。

Abstract: Output capacitors are among the most critical components in power electronic
converters, as their degradation directly affects system stability and
reliability. A key indicator of capacitor health is the Equivalent Series
Resistance (ESR), whose progressive increase is strongly correlated with aging
and imminent failure. This paper presents a real-time technique for estimating
the ESR of output capacitors in boost converters, with the aim of enabling
early fault prediction and condition-based maintenance. The proposed method
leverages online parameter estimation to extract ESR values without
interrupting converter operation. The estimation algorithm has been implemented
on a low-cost STM32 Nucleo platform, demonstrating both computational
efficiency and suitability for embedded applications. Experimental validation
confirms that the approach provides accurate ESR tracking under varying load

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的框架，用于评估线性时不变系统对恶意虚假数据注入传感器攻击的弹性。该框架利用稀疏可观测性概念，在模型未知的情况下通过攻击前数据或中毒数据来评估系统弹性。


<details>

Motivation: 传统方法需要系统模型来评估攻击弹性，但在实际中模型往往未知。本文旨在开发不依赖系统模型的数据驱动方法，仅使用运行数据来评估系统对传感器攻击的弹性。

Method: 基于稀疏可观测性概念，提出数据驱动的弹性度量。首先使用无攻击数据推导必要充分条件，然后扩展到仅能获得中毒数据的情况。在两种场景下都提供了多项式时间算法来评估系统弹性。

Result: 当获得满足特定秩条件的无攻击数据时，可以在模型未知情况下精确评估攻击弹性水平。对于仅能获得中毒数据的情况，只能保守评估系统弹性。数值实验验证了框架的有效性和局限性。

Conclusion: 该数据驱动框架能够在模型未知情况下评估系统对传感器攻击的弹性，为实际系统的安全评估提供了实用工具，特别是在无法获得准确系统模型的应用场景中。

Abstract: We present a data-driven framework for assessing the attack resilience of
linear time-invariant systems against malicious false data injection sensor
attacks. Based on the concept of sparse observability, data-driven resilience
metrics are proposed. First, we derive a data-driven necessary and sufficient
condition for assessing the system's resilience against sensor attacks, using
data collected without any attacks. If we obtain attack-free data that satisfy
a specific rank condition, we can exactly evaluate the attack resilience level
even in a model-free setting. We then extend this analysis to a scenario where
only poisoned data are available. Given the poisoned data, we can only
conservatively assess the system's resilience. In both scenarios, we also
provide polynomial-time algorithms to assess the system resilience under
specific conditions. Finally, numerical examples illustrate the efficacy and
limitations of the proposed framework.

Abstract: The increasing decentralization of power systems driven by a large number of
renewable energy sources poses challenges in power flow optimization. Partially
unknown power line properties can render model-based approaches unsuitable.
With increasing deployment of sensors, data-driven methods rise as a promising
alternative. They offer the flexibility to adapt to varying grid structures and
unknown line properties. In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven
representation of nonlinear power flow equations for radial grids based on
Willems' Fundamental Lemma. The approach allows for direct integration of
input/output data into power flow optimisation, enabling cost minimization and
constraint enforcement without requiring explicit knowledge of the electrical
properties or the topology of the grid. Moreover, we formulate a convex
relaxation to ensure compatibility with state-of-the-art solvers. In a
numerical case study, we demonstrate that the novel approach performs similar
to state-of-the-art methods, without the need for an explicit system
identification step.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法主要关注奖励最大化，缺乏对多维上下文（排队延迟、链路质量、共存强度和切换稳定性）的联合感知和推理，难以在带宽受限的NR侧行链路网络中实现高效的频段分配。

Method: 采用代理式双深度Q网络（DDQN）调度器，通过感知和推理多维上下文信息，结合容量感知和QoS约束的奖励函数，实现目标导向的调度而非静态阈值策略。

Result: 在带宽受限条件下，相比阈值策略，所提设计将阻塞率降低了高达87.5%，同时保持了吞吐量性能。

Conclusion: 上下文驱动的决策在共存受限的NR侧行链路网络中具有重要价值，所提出的调度器是专门为网络边缘任务特定、资源高效操作设计的具身代理。

Abstract: In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler
for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL)
networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the
agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly
captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching
stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns
the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under
constrained bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5%
versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value
of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL networks. The proposed
scheduler is an embodied agent (E-agent) tailored for task-specific,
resource-efficient operation at the network edge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际多智能体系统中，智能体通常具有多样化目标，这使得系统更加复杂，因为每个智能体在多个标准上的性能取决于所有智能体的联合行动，产生了复杂的战略权衡。

Method: 引入多目标马尔可夫博弈（MOMG）框架，提出帕累托-纳什均衡（PNE）作为解决方案概念，证明PNE的存在性，并建立PNE与对应线性标量化博弈纳什均衡的等价关系。开发了两阶段、无偏好的算法，将探索与规划解耦。

Conclusion: MOMG框架为多智能体多目标强化学习提供了理论基础，PNE作为核心解决方案概念，虽然计算具有挑战性，但通过提出的算法可以高效计算任意偏好配置下的PNE，完整刻画了帕累托-纳什前沿。

Abstract: In practical multi-agent systems, agents often have diverse objectives, which
makes the system more complex, as each agent's performance across multiple
criteria depends on the joint actions of all agents, creating intricate
strategic trade-offs. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Objective Markov
Game (MOMG), a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning with multiple
objectives. We propose the Pareto-Nash Equilibrium (PNE) as the primary
solution concept, where no agent can unilaterally improve one objective without
sacrificing performance on another. We prove existence of PNE, and establish an
equivalence between the PNE and the set of Nash Equilibria of MOMG's
corresponding linearly scalarized games, enabling solutions of MOMG by
transferring to a standard single-objective Markov game. However, we note that
computing a PNE is theoretically and computationally challenging, thus we
propose and study weaker but more tractable solution concepts. Building on
these foundations, we develop online learning algorithm that identify a single
solution to MOMGs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase, preference-free
algorithm that decouples exploration from planning. Our algorithm enables
computation of a PNE for any given preference profile without collecting new
samples, providing an efficient methodological characterization of the entire
Pareto-Nash front.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems are prevalent in a wide range of domains including power
systems, vehicular networks, and robotics. Two important problems to solve in
these types of systems are how the intentions of non-coordinating agents can be
determined to predict future behavior and how the agents can achieve their
objectives under resource constraints without significantly sacrificing
performance. To study this, we develop a model where an autonomous agent
observes the environment within a safety radius of observation, determines the
state of a surrounding agent of interest (within the observation radius),
estimates future actions to be taken, and acts in an optimal way. In the
absence of observations, agents are able to utilize an estimation algorithm to
predict the future actions of other agents based on historical trajectory. The
use of the proposed estimation algorithm introduces uncertainty, which is
managed via risk analysis. The proposed approach in this study is validated
using two different learning-based decision making frameworks: reinforcement
learning and game theoretic algorithms.

often struggle with scalability and consistency in such settings. We propose
PartnerMAS, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes evaluation
into three layers: a Planner Agent that designs strategies, Specialized Agents
that perform role-specific assessments, and a Supervisor Agent that integrates
their outputs. To support systematic evaluation, we also introduce a curated
benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments, featuring diverse firm
attributes and ground-truth syndicates. Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS
consistently outperforms single-agent and debate-based multi-agent baselines,
achieving up to 10--15\% higher match rates. Analysis of agent reasoning shows
that planners are most responsive to domain-informed prompts, specialists
produce complementary feature coverage, and supervisors play an important role
in aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that structured collaboration among
LLM agents can generate more robust outcomes than scaling individual models,
highlighting PartnerMAS as a promising framework for high-dimensional
decision-making in data-rich domains.

TL;DR: CORRECT是一个轻量级、无需训练的多智能体系统错误识别框架，通过在线缓存错误模式知识库，实现跨请求的错误结构识别和知识迁移，显著提升错误定位精度且几乎零开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统依赖复杂的协调、工具使用和长程推理，使得错误识别特别困难。微小错误会在智能体间传播，导致任务失败并产生难以调试的长执行轨迹。

Method: 提出CORRECT框架，利用在线缓存存储提炼的错误模式知识库，在推理时进行针对性错误定位，无需昂贵重训练，适应动态部署。

Result: 在七个多样化MAS应用上的实验表明，CORRECT将步骤级错误定位精度提升高达19.8%，且几乎零开销，显著缩小自动化与人类级错误识别之间的差距。

Conclusion: CORRECT通过重用错误结构知识，为多智能体系统提供了高效、轻量级的错误识别解决方案，能够适应动态部署环境。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly capable of tackling complex
real-world tasks, yet their reliance on inter-agent coordination, tool use, and
long-horizon reasoning makes error recognition particularly challenging. Minor
errors can propagate across agents, escalating into task failures while
producing long, intertwined execution trajectories that impose significant
costs for both human developers and automated systems to debug and analyze. Our
key insight is that, despite surface differences in failure trajectories (e.g.,
logs), MAS errors often recur with similar structural patterns. This paper
presents CORRECT, the first lightweight, training-free framework that leverages
an online cache of distilled error schemata to recognize and transfer knowledge
of failure structures across new requests. This cache-based reuse allows LLMs
to perform targeted error localization at inference time, avoiding the need for
expensive retraining while adapting to dynamic MAS deployments in subseconds.
To support rigorous study in this domain, we also introduce CORRECT-Error, a
large-scale dataset of over 2,000 annotated trajectories collected through a
novel error-injection pipeline guided by real-world distributions, and further
validated through human evaluation to ensure alignment with natural failure
patterns. Experiments across seven diverse MAS applications show that CORRECT
improves step-level error localization up to 19.8% over existing advances while
at near-zero overhead, substantially narrowing the gap between automated and
human-level error recognition.

TL;DR: MAS²是一个基于递归自生成原则的多智能体系统范式，能够自主为不同问题架构定制化多智能体系统。它通过生成器-实现器-修正器三智能体团队动态组合和自适应修正目标智能体系统，在复杂场景中比现有方法性能提升高达19.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动多智能体系统大多采用"一次性生成部署"的刚性范式，导致系统脆弱且无法适应现实环境的动态性和不确定性。需要超越这一限制，实现能够自主演化和适应的多智能体系统。

Method: 设计生成器-实现器-修正器三智能体团队，能够根据实时任务需求动态组合和自适应修正目标智能体系统。提出协作树优化方法来训练和专业化这些元智能体。

Result: 在7个基准测试中，MAS²在深度研究和代码生成等复杂场景中比最先进的多智能体系统性能提升高达19.6%。同时展现出优异的跨骨干网络泛化能力，使用未见过的LLM也能获得15.1%的改进。这些改进没有带来过高的token成本，始终位于成本-性能权衡的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: MAS²通过递归自生成范式成功克服了现有多智能体系统的刚性限制，实现了动态适应和自主演化，在保持成本效率的同时显著提升了复杂任务的处理能力。

Abstract: The past two years have witnessed the meteoric rise of Large Language Model
(LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS), which harness collective intelligence
and exhibit a remarkable trajectory toward self-evolution. This paradigm has
rapidly progressed from manually engineered systems that require bespoke
configuration of prompts, tools, roles, and communication protocols toward
frameworks capable of automated orchestration. Yet, dominant automatic
multi-agent systems, whether generated by external modules or a single LLM
agent, largely adhere to a rigid ``\textit{generate-once-and-deploy}''
paradigm, rendering the resulting systems brittle and ill-prepared for the
dynamism and uncertainty of real-world environments. To transcend this
limitation, we introduce MAS$^2$, a paradigm predicated on the principle of
recursive self-generation: a multi-agent system that autonomously architects
bespoke multi-agent systems for diverse problems. Technically, we devise a
``\textit{generator-implementer-rectifier}'' tri-agent team capable of
dynamically composing and adaptively rectifying a target agent system in
response to real-time task demands. Collaborative Tree Optimization is proposed
to train and specialize these meta-agents. Extensive evaluation across seven
benchmarks reveals that MAS$^2$ achieves performance gains of up to $19.6\%$
over state-of-the-art MAS in complex scenarios such as deep research and code
generation. Moreover, MAS$^2$ exhibits superior cross-backbone generalization,
effectively leveraging previously unseen LLMs to yield improvements of up to
$15.1\%$. Crucially, these gains are attained without incurring excessive token
costs, as MAS$^2$ consistently resides on the Pareto frontier of
cost-performance trade-offs. The source codes are available at

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: MARLIN是一个受椋鸟群智能启发的去中心化水库管理框架，通过整合生物启发规则与多智能体强化学习，在不确定条件下实现有效的全局协调，显著提升了洪水响应速度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候变化加剧极端天气事件，水灾害对全球社区构成日益严重的威胁。传统集中式优化方法计算复杂度高，无法有效处理现实世界中的不确定性，而现有的多智能体强化学习方法在不确定性下难以实现有效协调。

Method: MARLIN框架整合生物启发的对齐、分离和凝聚规则与多智能体强化学习，使单个水库能够做出局部决策，同时实现涌现的全局协调。此外，使用LLM提供实时奖励塑造信号，指导智能体适应环境变化和人类定义的偏好。

Result: 在美国地质调查局真实数据上的实验表明，MARLIN将不确定性处理能力提高了23%，计算量减少了35%，洪水响应速度加快了68%，表现出超线性协调能力，复杂度从400个节点扩展到10,000个节点时仅增加5.4倍。

Conclusion: MARLIN通过智能、可扩展的水资源管理，展示了在灾害预防和社区保护方面的巨大潜力，为应对气候变化带来的水资源管理挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose
growing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management
critical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security.
Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading
uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These
uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental
variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons
downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional
centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational
complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while
existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve
effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we
present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by
starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment,
separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs
to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In
addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to
adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on
real-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\%,
cuts computation by 35\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\%, exhibiting
super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000
nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and
protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.

Conclusion: 传感器融合方法通过结合IPS和轮式里程计的优势，为移动机器人提供了更准确可靠的室内定位解决方案，有效克服了单一方法的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate localization is crucial for effectively operating mobile robots in
indoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to mobile
robot localization by integrating an ultrasound-based indoor positioning system
(IPS) with wheel odometry data via sensor fusion techniques. The fusion
methodology leverages the strengths of both IPS and wheel odometry,
compensating for the individual limitations of each method. The Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) fusion method combines the data from the IPS sensors and the
robot's wheel odometry, providing a robust and reliable localization solution.
Extensive experiments in a controlled indoor environment reveal that the
fusion-based localization system significantly enhances accuracy and precision
compared to standalone systems. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in trajectory tracking, with the EKF-based approach reducing
errors associated with wheel slippage and sensor noise.

Abstract: This paper introduces a proposed control method for autonomous personal
mobility vehicles, specifically the Single-passenger Electric Autonomous
Transporter (SEATER), using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The
proposed method leverages a single-shooting approach to solve the optimal
control problem (OCP) via non-linear programming (NLP). The proposed NMPC is
implemented to a non-holonomic vehicle with a differential drive system, using
odometry data as localization feedback to guide the vehicle towards its target
pose while achieving objectives and adhering to constraints, such as obstacle
avoidance. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a number of
simulations have been conducted in both obstacle-free and static obstacle
environments. The SEATER model and testing environment have been developed in
the Gazebo Simulation and the NMPC are implemented within the Robot Operating
System (ROS) framework. The simulation results demonstrate that the NMPC-based
approach successfully controls the vehicle to reach the desired target location
while satisfying the imposed constraints. Furthermore, this study highlights
the robustness and real-time effectiveness of NMPC with a single-shooting
approach for autonomous vehicle control in the evaluated scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非结构化环境中的机器人操作需要生成鲁棒的长时程轨迹级策略，SE(3)-等变扩散模型具有数据效率优势，但存在推理时间成本高的问题。

Method: 将整流流引入SE(3)-等变扩散模型，提出ReSeFlow方法，使用SE(3)-等变网络保持旋转和平移对称性，实现测地线一致的快速策略生成。

Result: 在模拟基准测试中，ReSeFlow仅需一步推理即可达到比基线方法更好的性能，在绘画任务中误差降低48.5%，在旋转三角形任务中降低21.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了SE(3)等变性和整流流的优势，为生成式策略学习模型在真实世界应用中提供了数据和推理效率。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires the generation of
robust and long-horizon trajectory-level policy with conditions of perceptual
observations and benefits from the advantages of SE(3)-equivariant diffusion
models that are data-efficient. However, these models suffer from the inference
time costs. Inspired by the inference efficiency of rectified flows, we
introduce the rectification to the SE(3)-diffusion models and propose the
ReSeFlow, i.e., Rectifying SE(3)-Equivariant Policy Learning Flows, providing
fast, geodesic-consistent, least-computational policy generation. Crucially,
both components employ SE(3)-equivariant networks to preserve rotational and
translational symmetry, enabling robust generalization under rigid-body
motions. With the verification on the simulated benchmarks, we find that the
proposed ReSeFlow with only one inference step can achieve better performance
with lower geodesic distance than the baseline methods, achieving up to a 48.5%
error reduction on the painting task and a 21.9% reduction on the rotating
triangle task compared to the baseline's 100-step inference. This method takes
advantages of both SE(3) equivariance and rectified flow and puts it forward
for the real-world application of generative policy learning models with the
data and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Intelligent agents often require collaborative strategies to achieve complex
tasks beyond individual capabilities in real-world scenarios. While existing
audio-visual navigation (AVN) research mainly focuses on single-agent systems,
their limitations emerge in dynamic 3D environments where rapid multi-agent
coordination is critical, especially for time-sensitive applications like
emergency response. This paper introduces MASTAVN (Multi-Agent Scalable
Transformer Audio-Visual Navigation), a scalable framework enabling two agents
to collaboratively localize and navigate toward an audio target in shared 3D
environments. By integrating cross-agent communication protocols and joint
audio-visual fusion mechanisms, MASTAVN enhances spatial reasoning and temporal
synchronization. Through rigorous evaluation in photorealistic 3D simulators
(Replica and Matterport3D), MASTAVN achieves significant reductions in task
completion time and notable improvements in navigation success rates compared
to single-agent and non-collaborative baselines. This highlights the essential
role of spatiotemporal coordination in multi-agent systems. Our findings
validate MASTAVN's effectiveness in time-sensitive emergency scenarios and
establish a paradigm for advancing scalable multi-agent embodied intelligence
in complex 3D environments.

Abstract: Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) have emerged as a promising
solution to the scaling limits of two-dimensional designs, offering higher
integration density, shorter interconnects, and improved performance. As design
complexity increases, effective space planning becomes essential to reduce dead
space and ensure layout quality. This study investigates the use of large
language models (LLMs) for 3D IC space planning through a post-order slicing
tree representation, which guarantees legal space plans while aiming to
minimize dead space. Open-source LLMs were fine-tuned on large-scale synthetic
datasets and further evaluated on MCNC-derived 3D benchmarks. Experimental
results indicate that the proposed framework achieves a favorable balance
between runtime efficiency, legality, and dead-space reduction, with
zero-dead-space layouts obtained in a significant portion of test cases under
practical runtime budgets. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, the method generalizes
to MCNC cases such as ami33 and ami49, though larger and irregular instances
remain challenging. The approach also shows potential for cross-domain
applications, including logistics and 3D object placement, where spatial
efficiency is critical. Overall, the results suggest that LLM-based space
planning can serve as a data-driven complement to traditional electronic design
automation (EDA) methods, providing new insights for scalable 3D layout
generation.

Motivation: 现有方法要么只关注几何元素，要么将交通规则视为临时分类，无法在交通标志不可见时保持规则的持续有效性，这对安全自动驾驶至关重要。

Method: 提出PAMR框架，包含两个关键机制：Map-Rule Co-Construction用于处理时间片段的驾驶场景，Map-Rule Cache用于跨片段保持规则一致性。

Result: 在联合向量-规则映射任务中表现出优越性能，能够在扩展驾驶序列中保持规则的持续有效性。

Conclusion: PAMR框架成功实现了车道几何和交通规则的协同构建与持续维护，为安全自动驾驶提供了重要支撑。

Abstract: Safe autonomous driving requires both accurate HD map construction and
persistent awareness of traffic rules, even when their associated signs are no
longer visible. However, existing methods either focus solely on geometric
elements or treat rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their
persistent effectiveness across extended driving sequences. In this paper, we
present PAMR (Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules), a novel
framework that performs autoregressive co-construction of lane vectors and
traffic rules from visual observations. Our approach introduces two key
mechanisms: Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal
segments, and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across these
segments. To properly evaluate continuous and consistent map generation, we
develop MapDRv2, featuring improved lane geometry annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PAMR achieves superior performance in joint
vector-rule mapping tasks, while maintaining persistent rule effectiveness
throughout extended driving sequences.

Abstract: Ensuring safe and effective collaboration between humans and autonomous
legged robots is a fundamental challenge in shared autonomy, particularly for
teleoperated systems navigating cluttered environments. Conventional
shared-control approaches often rely on fixed blending strategies that fail to
capture the dynamics of legged locomotion and may compromise safety. This paper
presents a teleoperator-aware, safety-critical, adaptive nonlinear model
predictive control (ANMPC) framework for shared autonomy of quadrupedal robots
in obstacle-avoidance tasks. The framework employs a fixed arbitration weight
between human and robot actions but enhances this scheme by modeling the human
input with a noisily rational Boltzmann model, whose parameters are adapted
online using a projected gradient descent (PGD) law from observed joystick
commands. Safety is enforced through control barrier function (CBF) constraints
integrated into a computationally efficient NMPC, ensuring forward invariance
of safe sets despite uncertainty in human behavior. The control architecture is
hierarchical: a high-level CBF-based ANMPC (10 Hz) generates blended
human-robot velocity references, a mid-level dynamics-aware NMPC (60 Hz)
enforces reduced-order single rigid body (SRB) dynamics to track these
references, and a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (500 Hz) imposes
the full-order dynamics via quadratic programming to track the mid-level
trajectories. Extensive numerical and hardware experiments, together with a
user study, on a Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot validate the framework,
demonstrating real-time obstacle avoidance, online learning of human intent
parameters, and safe teleoperator collaboration.

Result: SePar在各种MAPF任务中持续优于现有学习方法，在未见环境中泛化良好

Conclusion: 序列建模方法为MAPD提供了有效的解决方案，Transformer架构能显著降低决策复杂度，模仿学习在复杂地图中具有必要性

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is a challenging extension of
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), where agents are required to sequentially
complete tasks with fixed-location pickup and delivery demands. Although
learning-based methods have made progress in MAPD, they often perform poorly in
warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways and long corridors when
relying only on local observations for distributed decision-making.
Communication learning can alleviate the lack of global information but
introduce high computational complexity due to point-to-point communication. To
address this challenge, we formulate MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and
prove that path-finding policies under sequence modeling possess
order-invariant optimality, ensuring its effectiveness in MAPD. Building on
this, we propose the Sequential Pathfinder (SePar), which leverages the
Transformer paradigm to achieve implicit information exchange, reducing
decision-making complexity from exponential to linear while maintaining
efficiency and global awareness. Experiments demonstrate that SePar
consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across various MAPF
tasks and their variants, and generalizes well to unseen environments.
Furthermore, we highlight the necessity of integrating imitation learning in
complex maps like warehouses.

Abstract: Accurate parameter identification of a subject-specific human musculoskeletal
model is crucial to the development of safe and reliable physically
collaborative robotic systems, for instance, assistive exoskeletons.
Electromyography (EMG)-based parameter identification methods have demonstrated
promising performance for personalized musculoskeletal modeling, whereas their
applicability is limited by the difficulty of measuring deep muscle EMGs
invasively. Although several strategies have been proposed to reconstruct deep
muscle EMGs or activations for parameter identification, their reliability and
robustness are limited by assumptions about the deep muscle behavior. In this
work, we proposed an approach to simultaneously identify the bone and
superficial muscle parameters of a human arm musculoskeletal model without
reconstructing the deep muscle EMGs. This is achieved by only using the
least-squares solution of the deep muscle forces to calculate a loss gradient
with respect to the model parameters for identifying them in a framework of
differentiable optimization. The results of extensive comparative simulations
manifested that our proposed method can achieve comparable estimation accuracy
compared to a similar method, but with all the muscle EMGs available.

*Arman Barghi,Hamed Hosseini,Seraj Ghasemi,Mehdi Tale Masouleh,Ahmad Kalhor*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出动态缓冲区规划原语，通过形成可移动的临时堆栈来改进杂乱桌面环境中的物体重排规划，在密集和大规模场景中分别减少11.89%和5.69%的机械臂移动成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划器在杂乱桌面环境中效率低下，使用固定缓冲区（如空闲桌面区域或静态堆栈）会导致高成本规划。静态堆栈一旦形成，基础物体无法移动，限制了效率。

Method: 引入动态缓冲区规划原语，受人类分组策略启发，允许机器人形成可移动的临时堆栈，整个堆栈可以作为一个单元运输。

Result: 与最先进的重排规划器相比，在密集场景中减少11.89%的机械臂移动成本，在大型低密度场景中减少5.69%的成本。在Delta并联机器人和二指夹爪上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 动态缓冲是成本高效和鲁棒重排规划的关键原语。

Abstract: Rearranging objects in cluttered tabletop environments remains a
long-standing challenge in robotics. Classical planners often generate
inefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed
buffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to
resolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense
scenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from
reaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra
buffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports
another, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these
issues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced.
Inspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary,
movable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both
feasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in
large-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art
rearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89%
in dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density
settings with a mobile manipulator. Practicality is validated through
experiments on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper. These findings
establish dynamic buffering as a key primitive for cost-efficient and robust
rearrangement planning.

*Brandon Vu,Shameek Ganguly,Pushkar Joshi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Empart是一个交互式工具，允许用户为3D网格的不同区域指定不同的简化容差，从而在保持关键区域精度的同时提高仿真性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的网格简化方法使用统一的误差容差，导致在非关键区域过度细化或在关键区域精度不足，无法满足机器人应用中不同区域对几何精度的差异化需求。

Method: 利用现有凸分解算法作为子程序，采用新颖的并行化框架处理区域特定约束，提供带有视觉反馈的用户友好界面进行迭代优化。

Result: 与V-HACD相比，在固定误差阈值下显著减少了凸部分数量，仿真时间减少了69%。

Conclusion: 交互式、区域特定的网格简化方法对于高性能机器人应用具有重要价值，能够在保持必要精度的同时大幅提升仿真效率。

Abstract: Simplifying complex 3D meshes is a crucial step in robotics applications to
enable efficient motion planning and physics simulation. Common methods, such
as approximate convex decomposition, represent a mesh as a collection of simple
parts, which are computationally inexpensive to simulate. However, existing
approaches apply a uniform error tolerance across the entire mesh, which can
result in a sub-optimal trade-off between accuracy and performance. For
instance, a robot grasping an object needs high-fidelity geometry in the
vicinity of the contact surfaces but can tolerate a coarser simplification
elsewhere. A uniform tolerance can lead to excessive detail in non-critical
areas or insufficient detail where it's needed most.
  To address this limitation, we introduce Empart, an interactive tool that
allows users to specify different simplification tolerances for selected
regions of a mesh. Our method leverages existing convex decomposition
algorithms as a sub-routine but uses a novel, parallelized framework to handle
region-specific constraints efficiently. Empart provides a user-friendly
interface with visual feedback on approximation error and simulation
performance, enabling designers to iteratively refine their decomposition. We
demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of convex parts
compared to a state-of-the-art method (V-HACD) at a fixed error threshold,
leading to substantial speedups in simulation performance. For a robotic
pick-and-place task, Empart-generated collision meshes reduced the overall
simulation time by 69% compared to a uniform decomposition, highlighting the
value of interactive, region-specific simplification for performant robotics
applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个使用自然语言提示多机器人团队执行高级任务的框架，将语言模型的推理能力与机器人协作决策相结合，通过RNN编码任务逻辑和GNN控制策略实现去中心化实时操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用最近语言模型在理解人类意图表达和任务分解方面的推理能力，将其重新用于多机器人协作和决策制定。关键挑战在于集体中个体行为难以指定和解释，需要持续适应其他机器人的动作。

Method: 将任务表示为确定性有限自动机(DFA)，使用RNN编码多个自动机，将语言模型获得的逻辑和子任务顺序分解提炼到RNN中，并使其内部状态与任务语义对齐。训练基于RNN隐藏状态和语言嵌入的GNN控制策略。

Result: 开发了一个轻量级可解释模型，在各种模拟和真实世界的多机器人任务中进行了评估，这些任务需要团队的顺序和协作行为。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将自然语言理解与多机器人协作相结合，通过将任务逻辑编码到RNN中并使用GNN控制策略，实现了机器人在去中心化方式下执行任务相关动作的能力。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with
high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use
the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in
understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these
for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an
individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and
must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework
that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and
semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time
operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented
as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and
sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an
RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By
training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the
hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots
to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present
evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various
simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and
collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段多机器人框架，用于在非均匀时空环境中估计时空场，通过变差函数驱动的规划器学习区域特定的空间长度尺度，并基于不确定性重新分配机器人以更新时间长度尺度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯过程方法通常假设全局长度尺度或仅周期性更新，有些允许空间变化但忽略时间变化，导致不确定性估计不准确。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用变差函数驱动的规划器学习区域特定的空间长度尺度；第二阶段采用基于当前不确定性的分配策略重新分配机器人，并在细化时间长度尺度时更新采样。

Result: 在多样化环境中评估了所提方法，提供了空间长度尺度估计的收敛性分析，以及量化与oracle分配序列差距的动态遗憾边界。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理非均匀时空环境中的场估计问题，通过分别学习空间和时间长度尺度来提高不确定性估计的准确性。

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed to estimate spatiotemporal fields
(e.g., wind, temperature, gas concentration) that vary across space and time.
We consider environments divided into non-overlapping regions with distinct
spatial and temporal dynamics, termed non-uniform spatiotemporal environments.
Gaussian Processes (GPs) can be used to estimate these fields. The GP model
depends on a kernel that encodes how the field co-varies in space and time,
with its spatial and temporal lengthscales defining the correlation. Hence,
when these lengthscales are incorrect or do not correspond to the actual field,
the estimates of uncertainty can be highly inaccurate. Existing GP methods
often assume one global lengthscale or update only periodically; some allow
spatial variation but ignore temporal changes. To address these limitations, we
propose a two-phase framework for multi-robot field estimation. Phase 1 uses a
variogram-driven planner to learn region-specific spatial lengthscales. Phase 2
employs an allocation strategy that reassigns robots based on the current
uncertainty, and updates sampling as temporal lengthscales are refined. For
encoding uncertainty, we utilize clarity, an information metric from our
earlier work. We evaluate the proposed method across diverse environments and
provide convergence analysis for spatial lengthscale estimation, along with
dynamic regret bounds quantifying the gap to the oracle's allocation sequence.

*Yanwei Du,Jing-Chen Peng,Patricio A. Vela*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Good Weights算法通过自适应融合视觉SLAM和航位推算，在视觉特征弱时增加航位推算权重，在视觉特征强时减少航位推算权重，提高SLAM系统的鲁棒性和连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉SLAM在纹理缺失或视觉退化环境中表现不佳，而机器人通常配备的航位推算传感器短期性能良好但长期不可靠，需要一种自适应融合方法来提高SLAM系统的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Good Weights算法框架，自适应地融合航位推算与被动视觉SLAM，修改SLAM系统中所有模块以整合航位推算，根据视觉跟踪可靠性动态调整航位推算权重。

Result: 在收集的数据集和实际部署中的实验表明，Good Weights算法能够提高视觉SLAM的性能和鲁棒性，保持姿态跟踪的连续性。

Conclusion: Good Weights为移动导航提供了一个实用的解决方案，通过自适应权重调整机制有效改善了视觉SLAM在挑战性环境中的表现。

Abstract: Given that Visual SLAM relies on appearance cues for localization and scene
understanding, texture-less or visually degraded environments (e.g., plain
walls or low lighting) lead to poor pose estimation and track loss. However,
robots are typically equipped with sensors that provide some form of dead
reckoning odometry with reasonable short-time performance but unreliable
long-time performance. The Good Weights (GW) algorithm described here provides
a framework to adaptively integrate dead reckoning (DR) with passive visual
SLAM for continuous and accurate frame-level pose estimation. Importantly, it
describes how all modules in a comprehensive SLAM system must be modified to
incorporate DR into its design. Adaptive weighting increases DR influence when
visual tracking is unreliable and reduces when visual feature information is
strong, maintaining pose track without overreliance on DR. Good Weights yields
a practical solution for mobile navigation that improves visual SLAM
performance and robustness. Experiments on collected datasets and in real-world
deployment demonstrate the benefits of Good Weights.

Method: 集成自我中心手部追踪、增强现实机器人叠加和实时深度感知，确保碰撞感知、运动学可行的演示。统一模仿学习管道将人类和虚拟机器人轨迹视为可互换的。

Conclusion: ARMimic能够实现安全、无缝的野外数据收集，为多样化真实世界环境中的可扩展机器人学习提供了巨大潜力。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a powerful paradigm for robot skill acquisition, yet
conventional demonstration methods--such as kinesthetic teaching and
teleoperation--are cumbersome, hardware-heavy, and disruptive to workflows.
Recently, passive observation using extended reality (XR) headsets has shown
promise for egocentric demonstration collection, yet current approaches require
additional hardware, complex calibration, or constrained recording conditions
that limit scalability and usability. We present ARMimic, a novel framework
that overcomes these limitations with a lightweight and hardware-minimal setup
for scalable, robot-free data collection using only a consumer XR headset and a
stationary workplace camera. ARMimic integrates egocentric hand tracking,
augmented reality (AR) robot overlays, and real-time depth sensing to ensure
collision-aware, kinematically feasible demonstrations. A unified imitation
learning pipeline is at the core of our method, treating both human and virtual
robot trajectories as interchangeable, which enables policies that generalize
across different embodiments and environments. We validate ARMimic on two
manipulation tasks, including challenging long-horizon bowl stacking. In our
experiments, ARMimic reduces demonstration time by 50% compared to
teleoperation and improves task success by 11% over ACT, a state-of-the-art
baseline trained on teleoperated data. Our results demonstrate that ARMimic
enables safe, seamless, and in-the-wild data collection, offering great
potential for scalable robot learning in diverse real-world settings.

Conclusion: 该方法能够从全局演示中学习到鲁棒的分布式控制器，无需专家动作或机载测量数据。

Abstract: Learning control policies for multi-robot systems (MRS) remains a major
challenge due to long-term coordination and the difficulty of obtaining
realistic training data. In this work, we address both limitations within an
imitation learning framework. First, we shift the typical role of Curriculum
Learning in MRS, from scalability with the number of robots, to focus on
improving long-term coordination. We propose a curriculum strategy that
gradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training,
stabilizing learning and enhancing the accuracy of long-term behaviors. Second,
we introduce a method to approximate the egocentric perception of each robot
using only third-person global state demonstrations. Our approach transforms
idealized trajectories into locally available observations by filtering
neighbors, converting reference frames, and simulating onboard sensor
variability. Both contributions are integrated into a physics-informed
technique to produce scalable, distributed policies from observations. We
conduct experiments across two tasks with varying team sizes and noise levels.
Results show that our curriculum improves long-term accuracy, while our
perceptual estimation method yields policies that are robust to realistic
uncertainty. Together, these strategies enable the learning of robust,
distributed controllers from global demonstrations, even in the absence of
expert actions or onboard measurements.

Conclusion: 基于差分贝叶斯滤波的轨迹合成方法在自主赛车超车任务中表现出色，能够处理复杂约束而不依赖简化假设。

Abstract: A significant challenge in autonomous racing is to generate overtaking
maneuvers. Racing agents must execute these maneuvers on complex racetracks
with little room for error. Optimization techniques and graph-based methods
have been proposed, but these methods often rely on oversimplified assumptions
for collision-avoidance and dynamic constraints. In this work, we present an
approach to trajectory synthesis based on an extension of the Differential
Bayesian Filtering framework. Our approach for collision-free trajectory
synthesis frames the problem as one of Bayesian Inference over the space of
Composite Bezier Curves. Our method is derivative-free, does not require a
spherical approximation of the vehicle footprint, linearization of constraints,
or simplifying upper bounds on collision avoidance. We conduct a closed-loop
analysis of DBF-MA and find it successfully overtakes an opponent in 87% of
tested scenarios, outperforming existing methods in autonomous overtaking.

Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive controller is designed for the synchronization of
the trajectory of a robot with unknown kinematics and dynamics to that of the
current human trajectory in the task space using the delayed human trajectory
information. The communication time delay may be a result of various factors
that arise in human-robot collaboration tasks, such as sensor processing or
fusion to estimate trajectory/intent, network delays, or computational
limitations. The developed adaptive controller uses Barrier Lyapunov Function
(BLF) to constrain the Cartesian coordinates of the robot to ensure safety, an
ICL-based adaptive law to account for the unknown kinematics, and a
gradient-based adaptive law to estimate unknown dynamics. Barrier
Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) functionals are used for the stability analysis to
show that the synchronization and parameter estimation errors remain
semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The simulation results
based on a human-robot synchronization scenario with time delay are provided to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed synchronization controller with
safety constraints.

prototype selection strategy that automatically adjusts the number of
prototypes to match task complexity, ensuring scalable and efficient
representation; (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through
extensive experiments in both simulation environments and real-world robotic

Abstract: End-of-Life (EoL) phones significantly exacerbate global e-waste challenges
due to their high production volumes and short lifecycles. Disassembly is among
the most critical processes in EoL phone recycling. However, it relies heavily
on human labor due to product variability. Consequently, the manual process is
both labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a low-cost,
easily deployable automated and selective disassembly and sorting system for
EoL phones, consisting of three subsystems: an adaptive cutting system, a
vision-based robotic sorting system, and a battery removal system. The system
can process over 120 phones per hour with an average disassembly success rate
of 98.9%, efficiently delivering selected high-value components to downstream
processing. It provides a reliable and scalable automated solution to the
pressing challenge of EoL phone disassembly. Additionally, the automated system
can enhance disassembly economics, converting a previously unprofitable process
into one that yields a net profit per unit weight of EoL phones.

articulated mechanisms due to contact-rich dynamics and under-modeled joint
phenomena such as friction, stiction, backlash, and clearances. We address this
challenge through dexterous in-hand manipulation of articulated tools using a
robotic hand with reduced articulation and kinematic redundancy relative to the
human hand. Our controller augments a simulation-trained base policy with a
sensor-driven refinement learned from hardware demonstrations, conditioning on
proprioception and target articulation states while fusing whole-hand tactile
and force feedback with the policy's internal action intent via
cross-attention-based integration. This design enables online adaptation to
instance-specific articulation properties, stabilizes contact interactions,
regulates internal forces, and coordinates coupled-link motion under
perturbations. We validate our approach across a diversity of real-world
examples, including scissors, pliers, minimally invasive surgical tools, and
staplers. We achieve robust transfer from simulation to hardware, improved
disturbance resilience, and generalization to previously unseen articulated
tools, thereby reducing reliance on precise physical modeling in contact-rich
settings.

TL;DR: 提出ST-OVSG方法，通过时空开放词汇场景图解决远程操作中的传输延迟问题，增强规划鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程操作中传输延迟导致远程感知状态与操作者意图不匹配，造成命令误解和执行错误

Method: 构建时空开放词汇场景图，包含时间动态性和轻量级延迟标注，通过匈牙利算法进行时间匹配，并采用任务导向子图过滤策略

Result: 在Replica基准测试中达到74%节点准确率，优于ConceptGraph；在延迟鲁棒性实验中，规划成功率达到70.5%

Conclusion: ST-OVSG能够泛化到新类别，无需微调即可增强对传输延迟的规划鲁棒性

Abstract: Teleoperation via natural-language reduces operator workload and enhances
safety in high-risk or remote settings. However, in dynamic remote scenes,
transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between
remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command
misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the
Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that
enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight
latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D
object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian
assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal
scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to
retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state
mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and
highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering
strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to
novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency
without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74
percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph.
Notably, in the latency-robustness experiment, the LVLM planner assisted by
ST-OVSG achieved a planning success rate of 70.5 percent.

Abstract: In Industry 4.0 applications, dynamic environmental interference induces
highly nonlinear and strongly coupled interactions between the environmental
state and robotic behavior. Effectively representing dynamic environmental
states through multimodal sensor data fusion remains a critical challenge in
current robotic datasets. To address this, an industrial-grade multimodal
interference dataset is presented, designed for robotic perception and control
under complex conditions. The dataset integrates multi-dimensional interference
features including size, color, and lighting variations, and employs
high-precision sensors to synchronously collect visual, torque, and joint-state
measurements. Scenarios with geometric similarity exceeding 85\% and
standardized lighting gradients are included to ensure real-world
representativeness. Microsecond-level time-synchronization and
vibration-resistant data acquisition protocols, implemented via the Robot
Operating System (ROS), guarantee temporal and operational fidelity.
Experimental results demonstrate that the dataset enhances model validation
robustness and improves robotic operational stability in dynamic,
interference-rich environments. The dataset is publicly available

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态模仿学习策略，将动作分块变换器与力和扭矩感知相结合，用于解决零售环境中饮料瓶抓取和重定向任务中的接触丰富边缘情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在零售环境中，机械臂机器人越来越多地被部署，但接触丰富的边缘情况仍然需要昂贵的人工远程操作。特别是直立放置的饮料瓶，纯视觉线索通常不足以解决精确操作所需的微妙接触事件。

Method: 开发了多模态模仿学习策略，将动作分块变换器（ACT）与力和扭矩感知相结合，实现了对图像、关节状态以及力和扭矩的端到端学习。在Telexistence公司的Ghost单臂平台上部署，通过检测和利用按压和放置过程中的接触转换来改进抓取和重定向瓶子的任务。

Result: 硬件实验表明，与匹配ACT观察空间的基线相比，该方法在任务成功率上有显著提升。实验表明，在视觉可观测性受限的按压和放置阶段，力和扭矩信号特别有益。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，通过将现代模仿学习架构与轻量级力和扭矩感知相结合，为扩展零售操作提供了一条实用路径，支持将交互力作为接触丰富技能的补充模态。

Abstract: Manipulator robots are increasingly being deployed in retail environments,
yet contact rich edge cases still trigger costly human teleoperation. A
prominent example is upright lying beverage bottles, where purely visual cues
are often insufficient to resolve subtle contact events required for precise
manipulation. We present a multimodal Imitation Learning policy that augments
the Action Chunking Transformer with force and torque sensing, enabling
end-to-end learning over images, joint states, and forces and torques. Deployed
on Ghost, single-arm platform by Telexistence Inc, our approach improves
Pick-and-Reorient bottle task by detecting and exploiting contact transitions
during pressing and placement. Hardware experiments demonstrate greater task
success compared to baseline matching the observation space of ACT as an
ablation and experiments indicate that force and torque signals are beneficial
in the press and place phases where visual observability is limited, supporting
the use of interaction forces as a complementary modality for contact rich
skills. The results suggest a practical path to scaling retail manipulation by
combining modern imitation learning architectures with lightweight force and
torque sensing.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合Wi-Fi RSSI指纹识别、LiDAR SLAM和IMU的多传感器室内定位导航框架，通过EKF滤波有效抑制噪声和漂移误差，显著提升定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Wi-Fi RSSI指纹定位精度不足，而LiDAR方案成本高且复杂，需要一种兼顾精度和实用性的室内定位解决方案。

Method: 使用DNN进行Wi-Fi RSSI粗定位，结合Gmapping SLAM生成地图和姿态估计，通过EKF预测-更新融合多传感器信息，抑制Wi-Fi噪声和IMU漂移。

Result: 在真实环境测试中，该框架平均2D误差为0.2449-0.3781米，远优于Wi-Fi RSSI（最高1.3404米）和LiDAR/IMU（0.6233-2.8803米）的单独方案。

Conclusion: 多传感器融合框架能够有效抑制单一方法的局限性，在所有路径配置下提供稳定的高精度定位性能。

Abstract: Conventional Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting
cannot meet the growing demand for accurate indoor localization and navigation
due to its lower accuracy, while solutions based on light detection and ranging
(LiDAR) can provide better localization performance but is limited by their
higher deployment cost and complexity. To address these issues, we propose a
novel indoor localization and navigation framework integrating Wi-Fi RSSI
fingerprinting, LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and
inertial measurement unit (IMU) navigation based on an extended Kalman filter
(EKF). Specifically, coarse localization by deep neural network (DNN)-based
Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting is refined by IMU-based dynamic positioning using a
Gmapping-based SLAM to generate an occupancy grid map and output high-frequency
attitude estimates, which is followed by EKF prediction-update integrating
sensor information while effectively suppressing Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU
drift errors. Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building
at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed
multi-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual
approaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations
with mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m. In
contrast, the mean 2D errors of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting reach up to 1.3404 m
in areas with severe signal interference, and those of LiDAR/IMU localization
are between 0.6233 m and 2.8803 m due to cumulative drift.

TL;DR: LAGEA框架利用视觉语言模型的语言反馈来指导机器人强化学习，通过总结尝试、定位关键时刻、对齐视觉状态，将语言反馈转化为密集的塑形奖励，显著提升操作任务的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人操作虽然受益于基础模型描述目标，但缺乏从自身错误中学习的系统方法。研究探索自然语言是否能作为反馈信号，帮助具身智能体诊断错误并纠正行为。

Method: 提出LAGEA框架：使用VLM生成情景化反思，总结每次尝试、定位轨迹中的决定性时刻，将反馈与视觉状态对齐，并将目标进展和反馈一致性转化为有界的逐步塑形奖励，通过自适应失败感知系数调节影响。

Result: 在Meta-World MT10基准测试中，LAGEA比最先进方法在随机目标上平均成功率提升9.0%，在固定目标上提升5.3%，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 当语言被结构化并在时间上接地时，是教导机器人自我反思错误并做出更好选择的有效机制。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation benefits from foundation models that describe goals, but
today's agents still lack a principled way to learn from their own mistakes. We
ask whether natural language can serve as feedback, an error reasoning signal
that helps embodied agents diagnose what went wrong and correct course. We
introduce LAGEA (Language Guided Embodied Agents), a framework that turns
episodic, schema-constrained reflections from a vision language model (VLM)
into temporally grounded guidance for reinforcement learning. LAGEA summarizes
each attempt in concise language, localizes the decisive moments in the
trajectory, aligns feedback with visual state in a shared representation, and
converts goal progress and feedback agreement into bounded, step-wise shaping
rewardswhose influence is modulated by an adaptive, failure-aware coefficient.
This design yields dense signals early when exploration needs direction and
gracefully recedes as competence grows. On the Meta-World MT10 embodied
manipulation benchmark, LAGEA improves average success over the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 9.0% on random goals and 5.3% on fixed
goals, while converging faster. These results support our hypothesis: language,
when structured and grounded in time, is an effective mechanism for teaching
robots to self-reflect on mistakes and make better choices. Code will be
released soon.

Conclusion: 该框架成功桥接了离线合成和在线操作，实现了四足机器人在动态未知地形上的鲁棒运动控制。

Abstract: We present an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over
dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing methods often depend on
heuristics for real-time foothold selection-limiting robustness and
adaptability-or rely on computationally intensive trajectory optimization
across complex terrains and long horizons. In contrast, our approach combines
reactive synthesis for generating correct-by-construction symbolic-level
controllers with mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and
physically feasible footstep planning during each symbolic transition. To
reduce the reliance on costly MICP solves and accommodate specifications that
may be violated due to physical infeasibility, we adopt a symbolic repair
mechanism that selectively generates only the required symbolic transitions.
During execution, real-time MICP replanning based on actual terrain data,
combined with runtime symbolic repair and delay-aware coordination, enables
seamless bridging between offline synthesis and online operation. Through
extensive simulation and hardware experiments, we validate the framework's
ability to identify missing locomotion skills and respond effectively in
safety-critical environments, including scattered stepping stones and rebar
scenarios.

Result: 在四足、双足和四旋翼机器人上的广泛实验表明，CE-Nav实现了最先进的性能，同时大幅降低了适应成本。真实世界部署验证了该方法的有效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: CE-Nav提供了一个高效且可扩展的解决方案，用于构建可泛化的导航系统，成功解决了跨机器人形态的导航策略泛化问题。

Abstract: Generalizing local navigation policies across diverse robot morphologies is a
critical challenge. Progress is often hindered by the need for costly and
embodiment-specific data, the tight coupling of planning and control, and the
"disastrous averaging" problem where deterministic models fail to capture
multi-modal decisions (e.g., turning left or right). We introduce CE-Nav, a
novel two-stage (IL-then-RL) framework that systematically decouples universal
geometric reasoning from embodiment-specific dynamic adaptation. First, we
train an embodiment-agnostic General Expert offline using imitation learning.
This expert, a conditional normalizing flow model named VelFlow, learns the
full distribution of kinematically-sound actions from a large-scale dataset
generated by a classical planner, completely avoiding real robot data and
resolving the multi-modality issue. Second, for a new robot, we freeze the
expert and use it as a guiding prior to train a lightweight, Dynamics-Aware
Refiner via online reinforcement learning. This refiner rapidly learns to
compensate for the target robot's specific dynamics and controller
imperfections with minimal environmental interaction. Extensive experiments on
quadrupeds, bipeds, and quadrotors show that CE-Nav achieves state-of-the-art
performance while drastically reducing adaptation cost. Successful real-world
deployments further validate our approach as an efficient and scalable solution
for building generalizable navigation systems.

Motivation: 多机器人团队主动信息采集的目标是保持各区域相对不确定性在同一水平，以确保所有区域具有相同的采集质量（如一致的目标检测）。虽然可以使用遍历覆盖根据观测质量分配采样次数，但噪声水平对机器人未知，且初始估计不可靠且波动大。

Method: 使用模拟退火生成目标采样分布，从均匀分布开始，通过变化玻尔兹曼分布的温度参数，以估计的采样熵作为能量，逐渐转向估计的最优分布。

Result: 仿真结果显示，与均匀搜索和直接遍历搜索相比，该方法在瞬态熵和渐近熵方面都有显著改进。通过TurtleBot群系统演示验证了算法的物理适用性。

Conclusion: 提出的模拟退火方法能够有效处理噪声水平估计的不确定性，在多机器人信息采集中实现更好的不确定性均衡和采集质量一致性。

Abstract: One of the goals of active information acquisition using multi-robot teams is
to keep the relative uncertainty in each region at the same level to maintain
identical acquisition quality (e.g., consistent target detection) in all the
regions. To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the
number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise
levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this
noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and
can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use
simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from
uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying
the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling
entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both
transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic
searches. Finally, a demonstration is performed with a TurtleBot swarm system
to validate the physical applicability of the algorithm.

TL;DR: GLUE是一个用于模仿学习的全局-局部统一编码框架，通过关键补丁跟踪来解决复杂OOD环境中的视觉表示问题，显著提升了策略的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂OOD环境中，全局视觉表示的注意力会被稀释或干扰，导致策略性能下降。局部表示对任务相关对象的不变性提供了解决方案。

Method: 使用文本引导机制选择和跟踪关键补丁作为局部表示，通过全局补丁特征查询局部补丁来提取关键信息，生成具有低异质性的细粒度局部特征。

Result: 在仿真环境中比最强基线提升17.6%，在真实环境中提升36.3%，在真实世界泛化设置中提升58.3%。

Conclusion: GLUE通过将训练和测试分布映射到相似且任务信息丰富的特征空间，有效增强了模仿学习策略的鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, visual representation learning has gained widespread
attention in robotic imitation learning. However, in complex
Out-of-Distribution(OOD) settings characterized by clutter and occlusion, the
attention of global visual representations can be diluted or interfered,
leading to degraded policy performance. The invariance of local representations
for task-relevant objects offers a solution. By efficiently utilizing these
local representations, training and testing data can be mapped to a more
similar feature space, thereby mitigating the covariate shift problem.
Accordingly, we propose GLUE, a global-local unified encoding framework for
imitation learning based on key-patch tracking. GLUE selects and tracks
key-patches as critical local representations by employing a text-guided
mechanism. It features a novel fusion framework where global patch features
query local patches to distill essential information, yielding fine-grained
local features with low heterogeneity relative to the global context. This
fused representation steers the robot's visual attention toward task-relevant
objects and preserves precise global context, which together align the training
and testing distributions into a similar and task-informative feature space,
ultimately enhancing the robustness of the imitation learning policy.
Experiments demonstrate that GLUE achieves strong performance across diverse
tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, outperforming the strongest
baseline by 17.6% in simulation, 36.3% in real-world environments, and 58.3% on
real-world generalization settings. The project website of GLUE is available at

Result: 该框架使四足机器人能够在严重外部扰动下同时实现力柔顺和鲁棒安全性。

Conclusion: 提出的切换策略框架成功解决了四足机器人在大扰动下的柔顺控制和安全性问题。

Abstract: Quadruped robots are designed to achieve agile locomotion by mimicking legged
animals. However, existing control methods for quadrupeds often lack one of the
key capabilities observed in animals: adaptive and adjustable compliance in
response to external disturbances. Most locomotion controllers do not provide
tunable compliance and tend to fail under large perturbations. In this work, we
propose a switched policy framework for compliant and safe quadruped
locomotion. First, we train a force compliant policy with adjustable compliance
levels using a teacher student reinforcement learning framework, eliminating
the need for explicit force sensing. Next, we develop a safe policy based on
the capture point concept to stabilize the robot when the compliant policy
fails. Finally, we introduce a recoverability network that predicts the
likelihood of failure and switches between the compliant and safe policies.
Together, this framework enables quadruped robots to achieve both force
compliance and robust safety when subjected to severe external disturbances.

TL;DR: 提出A2C2方法，通过轻量级的实时动作块校正头来改善VLA模型在推理延迟和长时域下的响应性，无需重新训练基础策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型预测动作块虽然提高了效率和时序一致性，但在推理延迟和长时域下会损害响应性。

Method: 设计异步动作块校正头，结合最新观测、VLA预测动作、位置特征和基础策略特征，输出每步校正量。

Result: 在动态Kinetix任务套件和LIBERO Spatial上，相比RTC方法分别提升23%和7%的成功率，在零延迟长时域下也提高了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: A2C2是一种有效的即插即用机制，可在实时控制中部署高容量分块策略，且开销极小。

Abstract: To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms
reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous
Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk
correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction
to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest
observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature
that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features
from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the
base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The
approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to
asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic
Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent
success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23%
point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves
robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the
correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the
inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an
effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in
real-time control.

Conclusion: gr-libs和gr-envs框架为目标识别研究提供了统一的开发、评估和比较平台，有助于推动该领域的标准化发展。

Abstract: Goal Recognition (GR) is the task of inferring an agent's intended goal from
partial observations of its behavior, typically in an online and one-shot
setting. Despite recent advances in model-free GR, particularly in applications
such as human-robot interaction, surveillance, and assistive systems, the field
remains fragmented due to inconsistencies in benchmarks, domains, and
evaluation protocols.
  To address this, we introduce gr-libs
(https://github.com/MatanShamir1/gr_libs) and gr-envs
(https://github.com/MatanShamir1/gr_envs), two complementary open-source
frameworks that support the development, evaluation, and comparison of GR
algorithms in Gym-compatible environments. gr-libs includes modular
implementations of MDP-based GR baselines, diagnostic tools, and evaluation
utilities. gr-envs provides a curated suite of environments adapted for dynamic
and goal-directed behavior, along with wrappers that ensure compatibility with
standard reinforcement learning toolkits. Together, these libraries offer a
standardized, extensible, and reproducible platform for advancing GR research.
Both packages are open-source and available on GitHub and PyPI.

Motivation: 大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在机器人环境中部署时容易受到越狱攻击，绕过安全机制导致现实世界中的不安全行为。现有的基于数据驱动的防御方法在专业领域数据集稀缺的情况下泛化能力不足。

Method: J-DAPT框架整合文本和视觉嵌入来捕捉语义意图和环境基础，同时将通用越狱数据集与领域特定的参考数据进行对齐，采用注意力融合和领域适应技术。

Result: 在自动驾驶、海洋机器人和四足机器人导航等领域的评估显示，J-DAPT将检测准确率提升至接近100%，且开销极小。

Conclusion: J-DAPT为机器应用中视觉语言模型的安全防护提供了一个实用的防御方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are
increasingly deployed in robotic environments but remain vulnerable to
jailbreaking attacks that bypass safety mechanisms and drive unsafe or
physically harmful behaviors in the real world. Data-driven defenses such as
jailbreak classifiers show promise, yet they struggle to generalize in domains
where specialized datasets are scarce, limiting their effectiveness in robotics
and other safety-critical contexts. To address this gap, we introduce J-DAPT, a
lightweight framework for multimodal jailbreak detection through
attention-based fusion and domain adaptation. J-DAPT integrates textual and
visual embeddings to capture both semantic intent and environmental grounding,
while aligning general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific
reference data. Evaluations across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and
quadruped navigation show that J-DAPT boosts detection accuracy to nearly 100%
with minimal overhead. These results demonstrate that J-DAPT provides a
practical defense for securing VLMs in robotic applications. Additional
materials are made available at: https://j-dapt.github.io.

Abstract: Autonomous technology, which has become widespread today, appears in many
different configurations such as mobile robots, manipulators, and drones. One
of the most important tasks of these vehicles during autonomous operations is
path planning. In the literature, path planners are generally divided into two
categories: probabilistic and deterministic methods. In the analysis of
probabilistic methods, the common problem of almost all methods is observed in
narrow passage environments. In this paper, a novel sampler is proposed that
deterministically identifies narrow passage environments using occupancy grid
maps and accordingly increases the amount of sampling in these regions. The
codes of the algorithm is provided as open source. To evaluate the performance
of the algorithm, benchmark studies are conducted in three distinct categories:
specific and random simulation environments, and a real-world environment. As a
result, it is observed that our algorithm provides higher performance in
planning time and number of milestones compared to the baseline samplers.

Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained models based on natural language has
breathed new life into robotics development. Extensive research has integrated
large models with robots, utilizing the powerful semantic understanding and
generation capabilities of large models to facilitate robot control through
natural language instructions gradually. However, we found that robots that
strictly adhere to human instructions, especially those containing misleading
information, may encounter errors during task execution, potentially leading to
safety hazards. This resembles the concept of counterfactuals in natural
language processing (NLP), which has not yet attracted much attention in
robotic research. In an effort to highlight this issue for future studies, this
paper introduced directive counterfactuals (DCFs) arising from misleading human
directives. We present DynaMIC, a framework for generating robot task flows to
identify DCFs and relay feedback to humans proactively. This capability can
help robots be sensitive to potential DCFs within a task, thus enhancing the
reliability of the execution process. We conducted semantic-level experiments
and ablation studies, showcasing the effectiveness of this framework.

Result: 通过MATLAB仿真验证了算法的有效性和优越性，相比标准方法表现更佳。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法框架能够有效平衡覆盖搜索和高精度主动跟踪，为复杂环境中的多机器人协同任务提供了解决方案。

Abstract: In unknown non-convex environments, such as indoor and underground spaces,
deploying a fleet of robots to explore the surroundings while simultaneously
searching for and tracking targets of interest to maintain high-precision data
collection represents a fundamental challenge that urgently requires resolution
in applications such as environmental monitoring and rescue operations. Current
research has made significant progress in addressing environmental exploration,
information search, and target tracking problems, but has yet to establish a
framework for simultaneously optimizing these tasks in complex environments. In
this paper, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm framework that
integrates three control strategies: a frontier-based exploration strategy, a
guaranteed coverage strategy based on Lloyd's algorithm, and a sensor-based
multi-target tracking strategy. By incorporating these three strategies, the
proposed algorithm balances coverage search and high-precision active tracking
during exploration. Our approach is validated through a series of MATLAB
simulations, demonstrating validity and superiority over standard approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents the framework \textbf{GUARD} (\textbf{G}uided robot
control via \textbf{U}ncertainty attribution and prob\textbf{A}bilistic kernel
optimization for \textbf{R}isk-aware \textbf{D}ecision making) that combines
traditional control with an uncertainty-aware perception technique using active
learning with real-time capability for safe robot collision avoidance. By doing
so, this manuscript addresses the central challenge in robotics of finding a
reasonable compromise between traditional methods and learning algorithms to
foster the development of safe, yet efficient and flexible applications. By
unifying a reactive model predictive countouring control (RMPCC) with an
Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that enables the attribution of
uncertainty sources online using active learning with real-time capability via
a probabilistic kernel optimization technique, \emph{GUARD} inherently handles
the existing ambiguity of the term \textit{safety} that exists in robotics
literature. Experimental studies indicate the high performance of \emph{GUARD},
thereby highlighting the relevance and need to broaden its applicability in
future.

Abstract: The growing ambition for space exploration demands robust autonomous systems
that can operate in unstructured environments under extreme extraterrestrial
conditions. The adoption of robot learning in this domain is severely hindered
by the prohibitive cost of technology demonstrations and the limited
availability of data. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Space Robotics
Bench, an open-source simulation framework for robot learning in space. It
offers a modular architecture that integrates on-demand procedural generation
with massively parallel simulation environments to support the creation of vast
and diverse training distributions for learning-based agents. To ground
research and enable direct comparison, the framework includes a comprehensive
suite of benchmark tasks that span a wide range of mission-relevant scenarios.
We establish performance baselines using standard reinforcement learning
algorithms and present a series of experimental case studies that investigate
key challenges in generalization, end-to-end learning, adaptive control, and
sim-to-real transfer. Our results reveal insights into the limitations of
current methods and demonstrate the utility of the framework in producing
policies capable of real-world operation. These contributions establish the
Space Robotics Bench as a valuable resource for developing, benchmarking, and
deploying the robust autonomous systems required for the final frontier.

Conclusion: 成功将TRIAD算法的次优特性整合到流形扩展卡尔曼滤波中，有效减轻了磁力计干扰对姿态确定的影响

Abstract: The manifold extended Kalman filter (Manifold EKF) has found extensive
application for attitude determination. Magnetometers employed as sensors for
such attitude determination are easily prone to disturbances by their
sensitivity to calibration and external magnetic fields. The TRIAD (Tri-Axial
Attitude Determination) algorithm is well known as a sub-optimal attitude
estimator. In this article, we incorporate this sub-optimal feature of the
TRIAD in mitigating the influence of the magnetometer reading in the pitch and
roll axis determination in the Manifold EKF algorithm. We substantiate our
results with experiments.

<details>

Motivation: 传统特征拼接方法在多模态融合中存在不足：视觉等主导模态会淹没触觉等稀疏但关键的信号，且单一架构无法灵活处理新模态或缺失模态而无需重新训练。

Method: 将策略分解为一组扩散模型，每个模型专门处理单一表示（如视觉或触觉），使用路由器网络学习共识权重来自适应组合各模态贡献，支持新表示的增量集成。

Result: 在RLBench模拟操作任务和真实世界任务（遮挡物体抓取、手内勺子重定向、拼图插入）中显著优于特征拼接基线，对物理扰动和传感器损坏具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态推理场景中表现出色，扰动重要性分析揭示了模态间的自适应切换，证明了分解策略方法的有效性。

Abstract: Effectively integrating diverse sensory modalities is crucial for robotic
manipulation. However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often
suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but
critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures
cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our
method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized
for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router
network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their
contributions, enabling incremental of new representations. We evaluate our
approach on simulated manipulation tasks in {RLBench}, as well as real-world
tasks such as occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, and puzzle
insertion, where it significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines
on scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning. Our policy further demonstrates
robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption. We further conduct
perturbation-based importance analysis, which reveals adaptive shifts between
modalities.

Motivation: 随着机器人在仓储等领域的部署增加，需要异构机器人团队之间无缝协作来解决意外冲突，但现有方法往往缺乏灵活性和效率。

Method: 使用LLM检测冲突并决定是否需要外部帮助，通过自然语言广播请求；帮助机器人使用基于STL的LLM推理，通过BNF语法确保有效的NL-to-STL转换，并使用MILP求解；请求机器人基于系统级任务完成时间增量选择帮助者。

Result: 实验表明，考虑多个帮助提议的方法能够最小化增加的完工时间，显著优于选择最近可用候选机器人的启发式方法，性能接近集中式"Oracle"基准但信息需求更低。

Conclusion: 该去中心化框架通过LLM和形式化方法的结合，实现了高效的机器人协作，在最小化信息需求的同时达到了接近最优的性能。

Abstract: Increased robot deployment, such as in warehousing, has revealed a need for
seamless collaboration among heterogeneous robot teams to resolve unforeseen
conflicts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decentralized
framework that enables robots to request and provide help. The process begins
when a robot detects a conflict and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to decide
whether external assistance is required. If so, it crafts and broadcasts a
natural language (NL) help request. Potential helper robots reason over the
request and respond with offers of assistance, including information about the
effect on their ongoing tasks. Helper reasoning is implemented via an LLM
grounded in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) using a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar,
ensuring syntactically valid NL-to-STL translations, which are then solved as a
Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Finally, the requester robot selects a
helper by reasoning over the expected increase in system-level total task
completion time. We evaluated our framework through experiments comparing
different helper-selection strategies and found that considering multiple
offers allows the requester to minimize added makespan. Our approach
significantly outperforms heuristics such as selecting the nearest available
candidate helper robot, and achieves performance comparable to a centralized
"Oracle" baseline but without heavy information demands.

Conclusion: 逻辑网络流框架通过创新的网络流建模和变量消元技术，显著提升了时序逻辑规划的计算效率，适用于复杂动态环境下的实时机器人规划。

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization-based task and motion planning framework,
named "Logic Network Flow", that integrates temporal logic specifications into
mixed-integer programs for efficient robot planning. Inspired by the
Graph-of-Convex-Sets formulation, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron
constraints on each edge of a network flow model, instead of as constraints
between nodes in traditional Logic Tree formulations. We further propose a
network-flow-based Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure that removes
continuous flow variables while preserving convex relaxation tightness, leading
to provably tighter convex relaxations and fewer constraints than Logic Tree
formulations. For temporal logic motion planning with piecewise-affine dynamic
systems, comprehensive experiments across vehicle routing, multi-robot
coordination, and temporal logic control on dynamical systems using point mass
and linear inverted pendulum models demonstrate computational speedups of up to
several orders of magnitude. Hardware demonstrations with quadrupedal robots
validate real-time replanning capabilities under dynamically changing
environmental conditions. The project website is at

Conclusion: 这是首次使用两个连续软体臂实现强力六自由度全身操作，证明了高速仿真结合运动基元引导在软体机器人控制中的有效性

Abstract: Whole-body manipulation is a powerful yet underexplored approach that enables
robots to interact with large, heavy, or awkward objects using more than just
their end-effectors. Soft robots, with their inherent passive compliance, are
particularly well-suited for such contact-rich manipulation tasks, but their
uncertainties in kinematics and dynamics pose significant challenges for
simulation and control. In this work, we address this challenge with a
simulation that can run up to 350x real time on a single thread in MuJoCo and
provide a detailed analysis of the critical tradeoffs between speed and
accuracy for this simulation. Using this framework, we demonstrate a successful
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of a learned whole-body manipulation policy,
achieving an 88% success rate on the Baloo hardware platform. We show that
guiding RL with a simple motion primitive is critical to this success where
standard reward shaping methods struggled to produce a stable and successful
policy for whole-body manipulation. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the
learned policy does not simply mimic the motion primitive. It exhibits
beneficial reactive behavior, such as re-grasping and perturbation recovery. We
analyze and contrast this learned policy against an open-loop baseline to show
that the policy can also exhibit aggressive over-corrections under
perturbation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of forceful,
six-DoF whole-body manipulation using two continuum soft arms on a large-scale
platform (10 kg payloads), with zero-shot policy transfer.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved notable success but often
struggle with limited generalizations. To address this, integrating generalized
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as assistants to VLAs has emerged as a popular
solution. However, current approaches often combine these models in rigid,
sequential structures: using VLMs primarily for high-level scene understanding
and task planning, and VLAs merely as executors of lower-level actions, leading
to ineffective collaboration and poor grounding challenges. In this paper, we
propose an embodied agent framework, PhysiAgent, tailored to operate
effectively in physical environments. By incorporating monitor, memory,
self-reflection mechanisms, and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes, PhysiAgent
offers an autonomous scaffolding framework to prompt VLMs to organize different
components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs to maximally
exploit VLAs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks,
showcasing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and
adaptive evolution of the framework during execution. PhysiAgent makes
practical and pioneering efforts to integrate VLMs and VLAs, effectively
grounding embodied agent frameworks in real-world settings.

Abstract: Quasi-direct-drive (QDD) actuation is transforming legged and manipulator
robots by eliminating high-ratio gearboxes, yet it demands motors that deliver
very high torque at low speed within a thin, disc-shaped joint envelope.
Axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machines meet these geometric and torque
requirements, but scaling them below a 20mm outer diameter is hampered by poor
copper fill in conventional wound stators, inflating resistance and throttling
continuous torque. This paper introduces a micro-scale AFPM motor that
overcomes these limitations through printed-circuit-board (PCB) windings
fabricated with advanced IC-substrate high-density interconnect (HDI)
technology. The resulting 48-layer stator-formed by stacking four 12-layer HDI
modules-achieves a record 45\% copper fill in a package only 5mm thick and 19mm
in diameter. We perform comprehensive electromagnetic and thermal analyses to
inform the motor design, then fabricate a prototype whose performance
characteristics are experimentally verified.

Abstract: Recent trends in humanoid robot control have successfully employed imitation
learning to enable the learned generation of smooth, human-like trajectories
from human data. While these approaches make more realistic motions possible,
they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate
prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its
interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to
divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability.
We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages
the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we
encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote
trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying
a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We
validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid
robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple
controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and
physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.

Abstract: Aerial outdoor semantic navigation requires robots to explore large,
unstructured environments to locate target objects. Recent advances in semantic
navigation have demonstrated open-set object-goal navigation in indoor
settings, but these methods remain limited by constrained spatial ranges and
structured layouts, making them unsuitable for long-range outdoor search. While
outdoor semantic navigation approaches exist, they either rely on reactive
policies based on current observations, which tend to produce short-sighted
behaviors, or precompute scene graphs offline for navigation, limiting
adaptability to online deployment. We present RAVEN, a 3D memory-based,
behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor
environments. It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as
persistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive
behaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to
scale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to
suggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These
components are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches
behaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor
simulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object
search, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes.
Results show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and
demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot
in outdoor field tests.

providing a rich foundation for training human-like grasp strategies. Building
upon this dataset, we perform geometry-based clustering to group objects by
shape, enabling a two-stage Geometry-based Expert Selection (GES) framework
that selects among specialized experts for grasping diverse object geometries,
thereby enhancing adaptability to diverse shapes and generalization across

success rates of 99.4\% and 96.3\% on the train and test sets, respectively,
showcasing strong generalization and high-quality grasp execution.

*Da Saem Lee,Akash Karthikeyan,Yash Vardhan Pant,Sebastian Fischmeister*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了Path Diffuser（PD），一种基于扩散模型的两阶段方法，无需历史轨迹信息即可生成符合道路的多样化交通场景，在分布指标、常识指标和道路合规性方面显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的规划器缺乏多样性和真实性，而基于学习的模拟器依赖历史轨迹数据，难以生成新场景且在处理OOD地图场景时会产生不切实际的轨迹。需要一种不依赖历史上下文的方法来生成多样化且符合道路的交通场景。

Method: 提出两阶段扩散模型Path Diffuser：第一阶段生成智能体姿态初始化，第二阶段生成对应轨迹，仅以地图为条件。结合基于运动基元的先验，利用Frenet框架候选轨迹增强多样性并确保道路合规性。探索了多种复杂多智能体交互建模的设计选择。

Result: 在Argoverse2数据集上的广泛实验表明，Path Diffuser在分布指标上比基线方法提升1.92倍，在常识指标上提升1.14倍，在道路合规性上提升1.62倍。在OOD地图变体上也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Path Diffuser提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在不依赖历史轨迹信息的情况下生成多样化且符合道路的交通场景，显著优于现有方法，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Simulating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios is critical for developing
and testing autonomous planning. Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity
and realism, while learning-based simulators often replay, forecast, or edit
scenarios using historical agent trajectories. However, they struggle to
generate new scenarios, limiting scalability and diversity due to their
reliance on fully annotated logs and historical data. Thus, a key challenge for
a learning-based simulator's performance is that it requires agents' past
trajectories and pose information in addition to map data, which might not be
available for all agents on the road.Without which, generated scenarios often
produce unrealistic trajectories that deviate from drivable areas, particularly
under out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes (e.g., curved roads). To address
this, we propose Path Diffuser (PD): a two-stage, diffusion model for
generating agent pose initializations and their corresponding trajectories
conditioned on the map, free of any historical context of agents' trajectories.
Furthermore, PD incorporates a motion primitive-based prior, leveraging Frenet
frame candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compliant
trajectory generation. We also explore various design choices for modeling
complex multi-agent interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through extensive experiments on the Argoverse2 Dataset and additionally
evaluate the generalizability of the approach on OOD map variants. Notably,
Path Diffuser outperforms the baseline methods by 1.92x on distribution
metrics, 1.14x on common-sense metrics, and 1.62x on road compliance from
adversarial benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有的分层粗到细策略在机器人3D操作任务中虽然提高了样本效率和操作精度，但即使结合预训练模型仍面临泛化问题，难以适应新指令和环境变化。

Method: CLAP框架包含三个关键组件：任务分解、VLM微调用于3D关键点预测、3D感知表示，通过语言对齐提升泛化能力。

Result: 在GemBench基准测试中，比SOTA方法平均成功率提高12%，仅使用1/5的训练轨迹；真实实验中，仅用10个演示样本就能成功泛化到新指令和环境。

Conclusion: CLAP框架有效解决了分层策略的泛化问题，在模拟和真实机器人实验中均表现出优异的泛化性能，显著提升了样本效率。

Abstract: Hierarchical coarse-to-fine policy, where a coarse branch predicts a region
of interest to guide a fine-grained action predictor, has demonstrated
significant potential in robotic 3D manipulation tasks by especially enhancing
sample efficiency and enabling more precise manipulation. However, even
augmented with pre-trained models, these hierarchical policies still suffer
from generalization issues. To enhance generalization to novel instructions and
environment variations, we propose Coarse-to-fine Language-Aligned manipulation
Policy (CLAP), a framework that integrates three key components: 1) task
decomposition, 2) VLM fine-tuning for 3D keypoint prediction, and 3) 3D-aware
representation. Through comprehensive experiments in simulation and on a real
robot, we demonstrate its superior generalization capability. Specifically, on
GemBench, a benchmark designed for evaluating generalization, our approach
achieves a 12\% higher average success rate than the SOTA method while using
only 1/5 of the training trajectories. In real-world experiments, our policy,
trained on only 10 demonstrations, successfully generalizes to novel
instructions and environments.

Motivation: 随着软体机器人向实际应用发展，需要明确定义安全性概念。软体机器人通过变形实现功能，但材料模型精度限制和失效风险是所有软体机器人固有的挑战。

Conclusion: 该工作为软体机器人提供了形式化的安全定义和强制执行机制，解决了材料模型精度和失效风险带来的安全挑战。

Abstract: Until recently, the concept of soft robot safety was an informal notion,
often attributed solely to the fact that soft robots are less likely to damage
their operating environment than rigid robots. As the field moves toward
feedback control for practical applications, it becomes increasingly important
to define what safety means and to characterize how soft robots can become
unsafe. The unifying theme of soft robotics is to achieve useful functionality
through deformation. Consequently, limitations in constitutive model accuracy
and risks of material failure are inherent to all soft robots and pose a key
challenge in designing provably safe controllers. This work introduces a formal
definition of material safety based on strain energy functions and provides a
controller that enforces it. We characterize safe and unsafe sets of an
incompressible hyperelastic material and demonstrate that safety can be
enforced using a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) with quadratic
program-based feedback control. As a case study, we consider a pressurized
hyperelastic tube with inertial effects, first-order viscous effects, and
full-state feedback. Simulation results verify that the proposed methodology
can enforce the material safety specification.

Motivation: 视觉信息易受遮挡、反射和光照变化影响，导致机器人运动不稳定。受动物感觉运动整合启发，需要结合本体感觉的稳定性和视觉的环境感知能力。

Method: 提出KiVi框架，分离本体感觉和视觉空间推理路径，使用本体感觉作为稳定主干，选择性整合视觉进行地形感知和避障，结合记忆增强注意力机制。

Conclusion: KiVi框架通过模态平衡的集成设计，有效提升了腿式机器人在真实世界中的运动稳定性和适用性。

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion has shown great promise in enabling legged robots to
perceive and adapt to complex environments. However, visual information is
inherently fragile, being vulnerable to occlusions, reflections, and lighting
changes, which often cause instability in locomotion. Inspired by animal
sensorimotor integration, we propose KiVi, a Kinesthetic-Visuospatial
integration framework, where kinesthetics encodes proprioceptive sensing of
body motion and visuospatial reasoning captures visual perception of
surrounding terrain. Specifically, KiVi separates these pathways, leveraging
proprioception as a stable backbone while selectively incorporating vision for
terrain awareness and obstacle avoidance. This modality-balanced, yet
integrative design, combined with memory-enhanced attention, allows the robot
to robustly interpret visual cues while maintaining fallback stability through
proprioception. Extensive experiments show that our method enables quadruped
robots to stably traverse diverse terrains and operate reliably in unstructured
outdoor environments, remaining robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) visual
noise and occlusion unseen during training, thereby highlighting its
effectiveness and applicability to real-world legged locomotion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人在真实环境中推动与自身重量相当的物体时的挑战，需要足够的操纵力和保持稳定性，特别是对于重型或不规则物体

Method: 采用分层框架：高层规划器规划推动行为和目标物体姿态，低层控制器维持运动稳定性并生成动态一致的关节动作；利用冗余接触点和高自由度实现接触力动态重分配

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中验证有效性，能够稳定推动不同尺寸和未知物理属性的箱子到指定目标姿态，无需额外微调即可从仿真部署到真实机器人

Conclusion: HeLoM框架成功实现了六足机器人对重物的稳定推动操作，展示了协调多肢体控制在非抓取操纵中的优势

Abstract: Robots in real-world environments are often required to move/manipulate
objects comparable in weight to their own bodies. Compared to grasping and
carrying, pushing provides a more straightforward and efficient non-prehensile
manipulation strategy, avoiding complex grasp design while leveraging direct
contact to regulate an object's pose. Achieving effective pushing, however,
demands both sufficient manipulation forces and the ability to maintain
stability, which is particularly challenging when dealing with heavy or
irregular objects. To address these challenges, we propose HeLoM, a
learning-based hierarchical whole-body manipulation framework for a hexapod
robot that exploits coordinated multi-limb control. Inspired by the cooperative
strategies of multi-legged insects, our framework leverages redundant contact
points and high degrees of freedom to enable dynamic redistribution of contact
forces. HeLoM's high-level planner plans pushing behaviors and target object
poses, while its low-level controller maintains locomotion stability and
generates dynamically consistent joint actions. Our policies trained in
simulation are directly deployed on real robots without additional fine-tuning.
This design allows the robot to maintain balance while exerting continuous and
controllable pushing forces through coordinated foreleg interaction and
supportive hind-leg propulsion. We validate the effectiveness of HeLoM through
both simulation and real-world experiments. Results show that our framework can
stably push boxes of varying sizes and unknown physical properties to
designated goal poses in the real world.

TL;DR: 提出Oat-VLA方法，通过对象-智能体中心化标记化方案，大幅减少视觉标记数量，实现高效VLA训练，在保持性能的同时显著提升收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在适应机器人领域时计算成本过高，主要归因于视觉输入的标记化方案效率低下。

Method: 基于对象中心表示学习，引入对场景对象和智能体自身视觉信息的归纳偏置，提出对象-智能体中心化标记化方法。

Result: Oat-VLA仅需少量视觉标记即可保持性能，在LIBERO套件上收敛速度至少比OpenVLA快两倍，在真实世界拾放任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 对象-智能体中心化标记化是提升VLA训练效率的有效方法，能显著减少计算成本而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a pivotal approach to learning
robotic manipulation at scale by repurposing large pre-trained
Vision-Language-Models (VLM) to output robotic actions. However, adapting VLMs
for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which
we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim
to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric
Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric
representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene
objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that
Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens
without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least
twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in
diverse real-world pick and place tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于迹约束半定规划的机器人问题求解框架，通过固定迹约束和梯度优化方法有效恢复秩1解，并在多个机器人应用中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人学中的许多非凸问题可以通过半定规划松弛为凸问题，但实际解的质量依赖于获得秩1矩阵，这通常需要额外的紧化处理。迹约束不仅捕捉重要结构特性，还便于使用一阶方法恢复秩1解。

Method: 引入定制化的固定迹变量和约束来表示机器人量（如旋转和平移），开发基于梯度的精化过程将松弛的SDP解投影到秩1、低成本的候选解，并通过对偶问题进行全局最优性认证。

Result: 展示了该框架在PnP估计、手眼标定和双机器人系统标定等任务中的有效性，并引入了模块化的"虚拟机器人"抽象来简化不同问题设置下的建模。

Conclusion: 迹约束SDP框架为机器人问题提供了一种有效的求解方法，能够获得高质量的秩1解，并通过模块化抽象支持更广泛的应用。

Abstract: Many nonconvex problems in robotics can be relaxed into convex formulations
via semidefinite programming (SDP), which offers the advantage of global
optimality. The practical quality of these solutions, however, critically
depends on achieving rank-1 matrices, a condition that typically requires
additional tightening. In this work, we focus on trace-constrained SDPs, where
the decision variables are positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices with fixed
trace values. These additional constraints not only capture important
structural properties but also facilitate first-order methods for recovering
rank-1 solutions. We introduce customized fixed-trace variables and constraints
to represent common robotic quantities such as rotations and translations,
which can be exactly recovered when the corresponding variables are rank-1. To
further improve practical performance, we develop a gradient-based refinement
procedure that projects relaxed SDP solutions toward rank-1, low-cost
candidates, which can then be certified for global optimality via the dual
problem. We demonstrate that many robotics tasks can be expressed within this
trace-constrained SDP framework, and showcase its effectiveness through
simulations in perspective-n-point (PnP) estimation, hand-eye calibration, and
dual-robot system calibration. To support broader use, we also introduce a
modular ``virtual robot'' abstraction that simplifies modeling across different
problem settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多机器人覆盖路径规划方法假设机器人以固定速度移动，这在现实应用中不切实际，导致机器人间工作量分配不平衡和覆盖任务完成时间增加。

Method: 使用高斯混合模型动态估计每个机器人的剩余工作量，通过容量约束Voronoi图分配覆盖区域，并开发了分布式实现用于范围受限的机器人网络。

Result: 仿真结果表明MDCPP相比现有扫描算法具有定性改进和优越性能，通信范围对覆盖效率有可量化的影响。

Conclusion: MDCPP算法能有效解决多机器人覆盖路径规划中的动态负载平衡问题，提高覆盖效率。

Abstract: Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) addresses the problem of computing
paths for multiple robots to effectively cover a large area of interest.
Conventional approaches to MCPP typically assume that robots move at fixed
velocities, which is often unrealistic in real-world applications where robots
must adapt their speeds based on the specific coverage tasks assigned to
them.Consequently, conventional approaches often lead to imbalanced workload
distribution among robots and increased completion time for coverage tasks. To
address this, we introduce a novel Multi-robot Dynamic Coverage Path Planning
(MDCPP) algorithm for complete coverage in two-dimensional environments. MDCPP
dynamically estimates each robot's remaining workload by approximating the
target distribution with Gaussian mixture models, and assigns coverage regions
using a capacity-constrained Voronoi diagram. We further develop a distributed
implementation of MDCPP for range-constrained robotic networks. Simulation
results validate the efficacy of MDCPP, showing qualitative improvements and
superior performance compared to an existing sweeping algorithm, and a
quantifiable impact of communication range on coverage efficiency.

Conclusion: DA-MMP成功学习了轨迹-动态映射，为复杂动态操作任务提供了有效的运动生成框架。

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation is a key capability for advancing robot performance,
enabling skills such as tossing. While recent learning-based approaches have
pushed the field forward, most methods still rely on manually designed action
parameterizations, limiting their ability to produce the highly coordinated
motions required in complex tasks. Motion planning can generate feasible
trajectories, but the dynamics gap-stemming from control inaccuracies, contact
uncertainties, and aerodynamic effects-often causes large deviations between
planned and executed trajectories. In this work, we propose Dynamics-Aware
Motion Manifold Primitives (DA-MMP), a motion generation framework for
goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation, and instantiate it on a challenging
real-world ring-tossing task. Our approach extends motion manifold primitives
to variable-length trajectories through a compact parametrization and learns a
high-quality manifold from a large-scale dataset of planned motions. Building
on this manifold, a conditional flow matching model is trained in the latent
space with a small set of real-world trials, enabling the generation of
throwing trajectories that account for execution dynamics. Experiments show
that our method can generate coordinated and smooth motion trajectories for the
ring-tossing task. In real-world evaluations, it achieves high success rates
and even surpasses the performance of trained human experts. Moreover, it
generalizes to novel targets beyond the training range, indicating that it
successfully learns the underlying trajectory-dynamics mapping.

Abstract: Modern locomotion controllers are manually tuned for specific embodiments. We
present LocoFormer, a generalist omni-bodied locomotion model that can control
previously unseen legged and wheeled robots, even without precise knowledge of
their kinematics. LocoFormer is able to adapt to changes in morphology and
dynamics at test time. We find that two key choices enable adaptation. First,
we train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive
domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous policies that are myopic
with short context lengths, we extend context by orders of magnitude to span
episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied robots and show
robust control even with large disturbances such as weight change and motor
failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes,
LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in
later ones. We believe that this simple, yet general recipe can be used to
train foundation models for other robotic skills in the future. Videos at

Abstract: To address the need for high-precision localization of climbing robots in

localization scenarios and the problem model are analyzed. An integrated
architecture of Attention Mechanism-based Fusion Algorithm (AMFA) incorporating
planar array Ultra-Wideband (UWB), GPS, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and
barometer is designed to handle challenges such as GPS occlusion and UWB
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) problem. Then, End-to-end neural network inference
models for UWB and barometer are developed, along with a multimodal attention
mechanism for adaptive data fusion. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is applied
to refine the trajectory, improving accuracy and robustness. Finally,
real-world experiments show that the method achieves 0.48 m localization
accuracy and lower MAX error of 1.50 m, outperforming baseline algorithms such
as GPS/INS-EKF and demonstrating stronger robustness.

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is critical for advancing robot capabilities in
real-world applications, yet diverse and high-quality datasets remain scarce.
Existing data collection methods either rely on human teleoperation or require
significant human engineering, or generate data with limited diversity, which
restricts their scalability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce
DexFlyWheel, a scalable data generation framework that employs a self-improving
cycle to continuously enrich data diversity. Starting from efficient seed
demonstrations warmup, DexFlyWheel expands the dataset through iterative
cycles. Each cycle follows a closed-loop pipeline that integrates Imitation
Learning (IL), residual Reinforcement Learning (RL), rollout trajectory
collection, and data augmentation. Specifically, IL extracts human-like
behaviors from demonstrations, and residual RL enhances policy generalization.
The learned policy is then used to generate trajectories in simulation, which
are further augmented across diverse environments and spatial configurations
before being fed back into the next cycle. Over successive iterations, a
self-improving data flywheel effect emerges, producing datasets that cover
diverse scenarios and thereby scaling policy performance. Experimental results
demonstrate that DexFlyWheel generates over 2,000 diverse demonstrations across
four challenging tasks. Policies trained on our dataset achieve an average
success rate of 81.9\% on the challenge test sets and successfully transfer to

TL;DR: 提出MAD-PINN框架，通过物理信息神经网络解决多智能体状态约束最优控制问题，实现安全性与性能的协同优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如多智能体强化学习、安全过滤或模型预测控制缺乏严格安全保证、过于保守或难以扩展。

Method: 采用基于epigraph的SC-OCP重构，使用物理信息神经网络近似解，通过降维训练和分散部署实现扩展性，引入HJ可达性邻居选择策略和滚动时域策略执行。

Result: 在多智能体导航任务中，MAD-PINN实现了优越的安全-性能权衡，保持扩展性，并持续优于最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: MAD-PINN为大规模多智能体系统提供了可扩展且严格安全的最优控制解决方案。

Abstract: Co-optimizing safety and performance in large-scale multi-agent systems
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches based on multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), safety filtering, or Model Predictive Control
(MPC) either lack strict safety guarantees, suffer from conservatism, or fail
to scale effectively. We propose MAD-PINN, a decentralized physics-informed
machine learning framework for solving the multi-agent state-constrained
optimal control problem (MASC-OCP). Our method leverages an epigraph-based
reformulation of SC-OCP to simultaneously capture performance and safety, and
approximates its solution via a physics-informed neural network. Scalability is
achieved by training the SC-OCP value function on reduced-agent systems and
deploying them in a decentralized fashion, where each agent relies only on
local observations of its neighbours for decision-making. To further enhance
safety and efficiency, we introduce an Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based
neighbour selection strategy to prioritize safety-critical interactions, and a
receding-horizon policy execution scheme that adapts to dynamic interactions
while reducing computational burden. Experiments on multi-agent navigation
tasks demonstrate that MAD-PINN achieves superior safety-performance
trade-offs, maintains scalability as the number of agents grows, and
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

*Vignesh Ramanathan,Michael Milford,Tobias Fischer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Flash是一个轻量级的视觉位置识别系统，使用事件相机在亚毫秒级时间内预测位置，通过编码活跃像素位置并使用快速位运算计算相似度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件相机的VPR方法依赖密集表示且需要数十到数百毫秒的事件数据，而Flash旨在打破这一范式，实现更快速的位置识别。

Method: 基于活跃像素位置提供强判别特征的观察，Flash使用高效的二进制帧编码这些位置，并通过快速位运算计算相似度，然后根据查询和参考帧中的相对事件活动进行归一化。

Result: 在室内QCR-Event-Dataset上Recall@1提高了11.33倍，在8公里Brisbane-Event-VPR数据集上提高了5.92倍。同时减少了机器人无位置感知的运行时间。

Conclusion: 这是首个使用事件相机实现亚毫秒级VPR的工作，显著提高了识别速度和准确性。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables systems to identify previously visited
locations within a map, a fundamental task for autonomous navigation. Prior
works have developed VPR solutions using event cameras, which asynchronously
measure per-pixel brightness changes with microsecond temporal resolution.
However, these approaches rely on dense representations of the inherently
sparse camera output and require tens to hundreds of milliseconds of event data
to predict a place. Here, we break this paradigm with Flash, a lightweight VPR
system that predicts places using sub-millisecond slices of event data. Our
method is based on the observation that active pixel locations provide strong
discriminative features for VPR. Flash encodes these active pixel locations
using efficient binary frames and computes similarities via fast bitwise
operations, which are then normalized based on the relative event activity in
the query and reference frames. Flash improves Recall@1 for sub-millisecond VPR
over existing baselines by 11.33x on the indoor QCR-Event-Dataset and 5.92x on
the 8 km Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset. Moreover, our approach reduces the
duration for which the robot must operate without awareness of its position, as
evidenced by a localization latency metric we term Time to Correct Match (TCM).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate
sub-millisecond VPR using event cameras.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于粒子祖先树拓扑结构的线性时间多样性维护方法，通过聚类密切相关的粒子来防止多模态环境中的过早收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态环境中，粒子滤波器容易过早收敛，需要有效的多样性维护机制来保持对多个可能状态的探索能力。

Method: 基于粒子祖先树拓扑结构进行聚类：将祖先树中密切相关的粒子分组，结合簇内适应度共享和保护未聚类粒子，无需空间或领域特定度量。

Result: 在多模态机器人仿真和真实世界室内环境中验证，相比确定性重采样和粒子高斯混合等算法，实现了高成功率且对紧凑性影响很小。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同领域和挑战性初始条件下表现出特别鲁棒性，能有效防止过早收敛同时保持估计紧凑性。

Abstract: We propose a method for linear-time diversity maintenance in particle
filtering. It clusters particles based on ancestry tree topology: closely
related particles in sufficiently large subtrees are grouped together. The main
idea is that the tree structure implicitly encodes similarity without the need
for spatial or other domain-specific metrics. This approach, when combined with
intra-cluster fitness sharing and the protection of particles not included in a
cluster, effectively prevents premature convergence in multimodal environments
while maintaining estimate compactness. We validate our approach in a
multimodal robotics simulation and a real-world multimodal indoor environment.
We compare the performance to several diversity maintenance algorithms from the
literature, including Deterministic Resampling and Particle Gaussian Mixtures.
Our algorithm achieves high success rates with little to no negative effect on
compactness, showing particular robustness to different domains and challenging
initial conditions.

Motivation: 解决主动视觉中视点规划的两个主要挑战：相机位置和图像提取中的噪声影响，以及在未知相似农业环境中的泛化能力，避免重新优化或重新训练的需求。

Method: 采用基于重建质量的优化框架，利用运动结构重建3D环境，通过贝叶斯优化方法高效执行视点规划，仅需少量函数评估即可处理不同噪声情况。

Conclusion: 所提出的视点规划框架能够高效优化相机布局，使用较少但信息丰富的图像实现准确的3D重建，并具备良好的噪声鲁棒性和环境泛化能力。

Abstract: Active vision (AV) has been in the spotlight of robotics research due to its
emergence in numerous applications including agricultural tasks such as
precision crop monitoring and autonomous harvesting to list a few. A major AV
problem that gained popularity is the 3D reconstruction of targeted
environments using 2D images from diverse viewpoints. While collecting and
processing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in
many practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the
placement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more
informative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective
reconstruction of the environment of interest. This process termed as view
planning (VP), can be markedly challenged (i) by noise emerging in the location
of the cameras and/or in the extracted images, and (ii) by the need to
generalize well in other unknown similar agricultural environments without need
for re-optimizing or re-training. To cope with these challenges, the present
work presents a novel VP framework that considers a reconstruction
quality-based optimization formulation that relies on the notion of
`structure-from-motion' to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sought
environment from the selected 2D images. With no analytic expression of the
optimization function and with costly function evaluations, a Bayesian
optimization approach is proposed to efficiently carry out the VP process using
only a few function evaluations, while accounting for different noise cases.
Numerical tests on both simulated and real agricultural settings signify the
benefits of the advocated VP approach in efficiently estimating the optimal
camera placement to accurately reconstruct 3D environments of interest, and
generalize well on similar unknown environments.

TL;DR: SPARTA是一个统一的机器人操作框架，专门处理物体状态变化任务（如捣碎、涂抹、切片等），通过空间渐进式物体变化分割图来感知可操作区域与已变换区域，生成结构化策略观察和密集奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数机器人操作研究关注物体的运动状态变化（拾取、放置等），但现实世界中许多任务涉及物体物理和视觉状态的渐进式变化，这类任务缺乏统一的处理框架。

Method: SPARTA整合了空间渐进式物体变化分割图，通过视觉技能感知特定任务中的可操作区域与已变换区域，生成结构化策略观察和密集奖励。提供两种策略变体：强化学习用于精细控制，贪婪控制用于快速部署。

Result: 在真实机器人上验证了3个具有挑战性的任务，涉及10种不同的真实物体，相比稀疏奖励和视觉目标条件基线，在训练时间和准确性方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 基于进度感知的视觉表示为更广泛的物体状态操作任务提供了通用基础，SPARTA框架为该类任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects:
picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of
real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state
change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and
visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We
present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state
change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common
structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes
that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a
transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially
progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive
actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to
generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance
variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time.
These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for
fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control
for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three
challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant
improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual
goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual
representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object
state manipulation tasks. Project website:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的3D运动规划建模方法和快速算法，适用于固定翼无人机，考虑完整车辆方向（滚转、俯仰、偏航角）和双控制输入，生成满足运动约束的最短路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅考虑俯仰和/或航向角，无法唯一确定方向；且大多依赖单一输入（如路径曲率），无法准确建模3D运动学。需要更完整的姿态建模和更精确的控制输入表示。

Method: 使用旋转最小化框架描述车辆配置及其演化，通过在球面、圆柱面或平面上连接最优Dubins路径来构建路径，采用双控制输入表示有界俯仰和偏航速率。

Result: 数值模拟显示该方法平均在10秒内生成可行路径，在大多数情况下比现有方法产生更短的路径。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理完整3D姿态约束，提供更准确的运动规划，计算效率高且路径质量优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new modeling approach and a fast algorithm for 3D
motion planning, applicable for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. The goal
is to construct the shortest path connecting given initial and final
configurations subject to motion constraints. Our work differs from existing
literature in two ways. First, we consider full vehicle orientation using a
body-attached frame, which includes roll, pitch, and yaw angles. However,
existing work uses only pitch and/or heading angle, which is insufficient to
uniquely determine orientation. Second, we use two control inputs to represent
bounded pitch and yaw rates, reflecting control by two separate actuators. In
contrast, most previous methods rely on a single input, such as path curvature,
which is insufficient for accurately modeling the vehicle's kinematics in 3D.
We use a rotation minimizing frame to describe the vehicle's configuration and
its evolution, and construct paths by concatenating optimal Dubins paths on
spherical, cylindrical, or planar surfaces. Numerical simulations show our
approach generates feasible paths within 10 seconds on average and yields
shorter paths than existing methods in most cases.

TL;DR: MTP框架利用来自不同环境的成功控制代码作为程序知识，通过检索和上下文适应实现LLM驱动的机器人规划，无需更新模型参数即可提升跨环境适应性和成功率。


<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM机器人操作方法难以适应新环境，需要环境特定的策略训练或依赖固定提示，导致可迁移性差且需要手动重新调优。

Method: MTP框架：(i)使用LLM生成初始计划和代码，(ii)从代码记忆中检索相关成功示例，(iii)将检索到的代码上下文适应到目标设置中进行重新规划。

Result: 在RLBench、CALVIN和物理机器人上的评估显示，MTP相比固定提示代码生成、简单检索和无记忆重新规划，持续提高了成功率和适应性。仿真构建的记忆在硬件实验中同样有效。

Conclusion: MTP提供了一种实用方法，利用程序知识实现跨多样化机器人操作场景的鲁棒LLM规划，增强了对新环境的适应性并弥合了仿真与现实部署之间的差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored in robot manipulation,
but many existing methods struggle to adapt to new environments. Many systems
require either environment-specific policy training or depend on fixed prompts
and single-shot code generation, leading to limited transferability and manual
re-tuning. We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that
leverages successful control-code examples from different environments as
procedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven
planning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs,
(ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii)
contextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning
without updating model parameters. We evaluate MTP on RLBench, CALVIN, and a
physical robot, demonstrating effectiveness beyond simulation. Across these
settings, MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability compared with
fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning.
Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in
simulation proved effective. MTP provides a practical approach that exploits
procedural knowledge to realize robust LLM-based planning across diverse
robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments
and bridging simulation and real-world deployment.

<details>

Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在机器人规划中缺乏对物体物理属性（如重量、稳定性）的知识，导致在长时程堆叠任务中效果不佳。

Method: 使用多模态LLM作为高级规划器，创建包含堆叠偏好（重量、稳定性、尺寸、占地面积）的自定义数据集来微调模型。

Result: 相比仅使用提示调优的预训练LLM，经过自定义数据集微调的LLM在堆叠完成度上有显著提升，并在真实人形机器人上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM结合物理属性微调能够有效提升长时程机器人堆叠任务的规划能力，在仿真和真实环境中均表现出色。

Abstract: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) can work as high-level robotic
planners by reasoning over abstract task descriptions and natural language
instructions, etc. However, they have shown a lack of knowledge and
effectiveness in planning long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks where the
physical properties of the objects are essential. An example is the stacking of
containers with hidden objects inside, which involves reasoning over hidden
physics properties such as weight and stability. To this end, this paper
proposes to use multimodal LLMs as high-level planners for such long-horizon
robotic stacking tasks. The LLM takes multimodal inputs for each object to
stack and infers the current best stacking sequence by reasoning over stacking
preferences. Furthermore, in order to enable the LLM to reason over multiple
preferences at the same time without giving explicit instructions, we propose
to create a custom dataset considering stacking preferences including weight,
stability, size, and footprint, to fine-tune the LLM. Compared to the
pretrained LLM with prompt tuning, we demonstrate the improved stacking
completion of the LLM fine-tuned with our custom dataset via large-scale
simulation evaluation. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for the long-horizon stacking task on a real humanoid robot
in an online manner.

Motivation: 传统强化学习和模仿学习的机器人适应新任务较慢，而大语言模型和视觉语言模型虽然能从少量数据中规划，但存在符号计划缺乏场景几何基础和执行可靠性不足的问题。

Method: 提出ViReSkill框架，包含视觉基础的重规划和技能记忆系统。失败时根据当前场景重新规划动作序列，成功时将执行计划存储为可重用技能，后续遇到相同情况时直接回放而不需要重新调用大模型。

Conclusion: ViReSkill通过反馈循环实现了自主持续学习，每次尝试都能扩展技能集并稳定后续执行，为解决大模型在机器人运动规划中的落地问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Robots trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Imitation Learning (IL)
often adapt slowly to new tasks, whereas recent Large Language Models (LLMs)
and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promise knowledge-rich planning from minimal
data. Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key
obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object
physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining
execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs
vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When
a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on
the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed
plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without
additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual
learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes
subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and
RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently
outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust
sim-to-real generalization.

Motivation: 当前RGB-D SLAM系统在相机经历大视角变化、快速运动或突然抖动时容易失败。基于优化的方法精度高但对大运动的初始化敏感，基于学习的方法鲁棒但稠密重建精度不足。

Conclusion: 结合简单而原则性的技术可以同时实现不稳定运动的鲁棒性和稠密重建的精度。

Abstract: Real-time dense scene reconstruction during unstable camera motions is
crucial for robotics, yet current RGB-D SLAM systems fail when cameras
experience large viewpoint changes, fast motions, or sudden shaking. Classical
optimization-based methods deliver high accuracy but fail with poor
initialization during large motions, while learning-based approaches provide
robustness but lack sufficient accuracy for dense reconstruction. We address
this challenge through a combination of learning-based initialization with
optimization-based refinement. Our method employs a camera pose regression
network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames,
which serve as reliable starting points for a randomized optimization algorithm
that further aligns depth images with the scene geometry. Extensive experiments
demonstrate promising results: our approach outperforms the best competitor on
challenging benchmarks, while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion
sequences. The system operates in real-time, showcasing that combining simple
and principled techniques can achieve both robustness for unstable motions and
accuracy for dense reconstruction. Project page:

TL;DR: SafeFlowMatcher结合流匹配和屏障函数，通过预测-校正积分器实现实时高效且安全认证的路径规划，避免分布漂移和局部陷阱问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流匹配的生成规划器虽然能快速生成高质量路径，但缺乏正式的安全保证，在约束附近可能产生不完整路径。

Method: 使用两阶段预测-校正积分器：预测阶段集成学习到的流匹配获得候选路径；校正阶段通过时间缩放向量场和基于屏障函数的二次规划对路径进行最小扰动修正。

Result: 在迷宫导航和运动基准测试中，SafeFlowMatcher比基于扩散和流匹配的基线方法获得更快、更平滑、更安全的路径。

Conclusion: SafeFlowMatcher框架成功实现了实时效率和认证安全的平衡，通过屏障证书确保了鲁棒安全集的前向不变性和有限时间收敛性。

Abstract: Generative planners based on flow matching (FM) can produce high-quality
paths in one or a few ODE steps, but their sampling dynamics offer no formal
safety guarantees and can yield incomplete paths near constraints. We present
SafeFlowMatcher, a planning framework that couples FM with control barrier
functions (CBFs) to achieve both real-time efficiency and certified safety.
SafeFlowMatcher uses a two-phase prediction-correction (PC) integrator: (i) a
prediction phase integrates the learned FM once (or a few steps) to obtain a
candidate path without intervention; (ii) a correction phase refines this path
with a vanishing time-scaled vector field and a CBF-based quadratic program
that minimally perturbs the vector field. We prove a barrier certificate for
the resulting flow system, establishing forward invariance of a robust safe set
and finite-time convergence to the safe set. By enforcing safety only on the
executed path (rather than on all intermediate latent paths), SafeFlowMatcher
avoids distributional drift and mitigates local trap problems. Across maze
navigation and locomotion benchmarks, SafeFlowMatcher attains faster, smoother,
and safer paths than diffusion- and FM-based baselines. Extensive ablations
corroborate the contributions of the PC integrator and the barrier certificate.

Conclusion: 该方法消除了全面环境训练的需求，同时在不同条件下保持鲁棒性能，显著提高了自适应控制器的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Adaptive controllers on quadrotors typically rely on estimation of
disturbances to ensure robust trajectory tracking. Estimating disturbances
across diverse environmental contexts is challenging due to the inherent
variability and uncertainty in the real world. Such estimators require
extensive fine-tuning for a specific scenario, which makes them inflexible and
brittle to changing conditions. Machine-learning approaches, such as training a
neural network to tune the estimator's parameters, are promising. However,
collecting data across all possible environmental contexts is impossible. It is
also inefficient as the same estimator parameters could work for "nearby"
contexts. In this paper, we present a sequential decision making strategy that
decides which environmental contexts, using Bayesian Optimization with a
Gaussian Process, to collect data from in order to ensure robust performance
across a wide range of contexts. Our method, Contextual NeuroMHE, eliminates
the need for exhaustive training across all environments while maintaining
robust performance under different conditions. By enabling the neural network
to adapt its parameters dynamically, our method improves both efficiency and
generalization. Experimental results in various real-world settings demonstrate
that our approach outperforms the prior work by 20.3\% in terms of maximum
absolute position error and can capture the variations in the environment with
a few carefully chosen contexts.

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning is a well-established approach in autonomous
driving, valued for its modularity and analytical tractability. In complex
urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many
infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid
framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and
evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent
guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield
feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by
deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler
with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both
variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent
representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation
environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction
of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and
collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable
decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer
and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints. Code and trained

Abstract: Understanding human instructions and accomplishing Vision-Language Navigation
tasks in unknown environments is essential for robots. However, existing
modular approaches heavily rely on the quality of training data and often
exhibit poor generalization. Vision-Language Model based methods, while
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities, tend to perform
unsatisfactorily when semantic cues are weak. To address these issues, this
paper proposes SONAR, an aggregated reasoning approach through a cross modal
paradigm. The proposed method integrates a semantic map based target prediction
module with a Vision-Language Model based value map module, enabling more
robust navigation in unknown environments with varying levels of semantic cues,
and effectively balancing generalization ability with scene adaptability. In
terms of target localization, we propose a strategy that integrates multi-scale
semantic maps with confidence maps, aiming to mitigate false detections of
target objects. We conducted an evaluation of the SONAR within the Gazebo
simulator, leveraging the most challenging Matterport 3D (MP3D) dataset as the
experimental benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that SONAR achieves a
success rate of 38.4% and an SPL of 17.7%.

TL;DR: AdaNav是一个基于不确定性的自适应推理框架，通过动态触发推理来提升视觉语言导航性能，在少量训练数据下显著超越大规模训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言导航需要代理根据自然语言指令在长序列视觉观察中进行导航。固定步长的推理会导致性能不佳和计算浪费，因此需要自适应推理机制。

Method: 提出AdaNav框架，核心是不确定性自适应推理块(UAR)，使用动作熵作为策略先验，并通过启发式到强化学习的训练方法逐步优化推理策略。

Result: 仅用6K训练样本，在R2R val-unseen上成功率提升20%，在RxR-CE上提升11.7%，在真实场景中提升11.4%，显著超越百万级数据训练的闭源模型。

Conclusion: AdaNav证明了自适应推理在视觉语言导航中的有效性，能够在数据受限的具身任务中学习难度感知的推理策略，实现高效导航。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language
instructions by grounding them in sequential visual observations over long
horizons. Explicit reasoning could enhance temporal consistency and perception
action alignment, but reasoning at fixed steps often leads to suboptimal
performance and unnecessary computation. To address this, we propose AdaNav, an
uncertainty-based adaptive reasoning framework for VLN. At its core is the
Uncertainty Adaptive Reasoning Block (UAR), a lightweight plugin that
dynamically triggers reasoning. We introduce Action Entropy as a policy prior
for UAR and progressively refine it through a Heuristics to RL training method,
enabling agents to learn difficulty aware reasoning policies under the strict
data limitations of embodied tasks. Results show that with only 6K training
samples, AdaNav achieves substantial gains over closed source models trained on
million scale data, improving success rate by 20% on R2R val-unseen, 11.7% on
RxR-CE, and 11.4% in real world scenes. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索游戏理论作为研究人机混合群体中合作与信任的方法，了解机器人在促进群体信任和凝聚力方面的作用。

Method: 使用改进的公共物品博弈，让三名人类参与者与人形机器人iCub进行游戏，测试不同机器人策略（总是合作、总是搭便车、以牙还牙）对参与者合作倾向的影响。

Result: 初步分析表明，尽管参与者认为机器人是慷慨的，但他们仍然倾向于不向公共池投资。

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发能够促进人机混合群体中信任与合作的社会机器人提供了有价值的见解和潜力。

Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of Game Theory as a means to
investigate cooperation and trust in human-robot mixed groups. Particularly, we
introduce the Public Good Game (PGG), a model highlighting the tension between
individual self-interest and collective well-being. In this work, we present a
modified version of the PGG, where three human participants engage in the game
with the humanoid robot iCub to assess whether various robot game strategies
(e.g., always cooperate, always free ride, and tit-for-tat) can influence the
participants' inclination to cooperate. We test our setup during a pilot study
with nineteen participants. A preliminary analysis indicates that participants
prefer not to invest their money in the common pool, despite they perceive the
robot as generous. By conducting this research, we seek to gain valuable
insights into the role that robots can play in promoting trust and cohesion
during human-robot interactions within group contexts. The results of this
study may hold considerable potential for developing social robots capable of
fostering trust and cooperation within mixed human-robot groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于PPO的模仿学习方法优先考虑稳定性但牺牲了样本效率和策略泛化能力，需要更高效的算法框架

Method: 将对抗运动先验(AMP)与离策略软演员-评论者(SAC)算法结合，利用回放驱动学习和熵正则化探索

Result: 在四足机器人步态实验中，AMP+SAC不仅保持稳定任务执行，还比AMP+PPO获得更高的模仿奖励

Conclusion: 离策略模仿学习框架在机器人运动生成方面具有重要潜力，能提高数据效率和鲁棒性

Abstract: Learning-based methods have enabled robots to acquire bio-inspired movements
with increasing levels of naturalness and adaptability. Among these, Imitation
Learning (IL) has proven effective in transferring complex motion patterns from
animals to robotic systems. However, current state-of-the-art frameworks
predominantly rely on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), an on-policy
algorithm that prioritizes stability over sample efficiency and policy
generalization. This paper proposes a novel IL framework that combines
Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) with the off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
algorithm to overcome these limitations. This integration leverages
replay-driven learning and entropy-regularized exploration, enabling
naturalistic behavior and task execution, improving data efficiency and
robustness. We evaluate the proposed approach (AMP+SAC) on quadruped gaits
involving multiple reference motions and diverse terrains. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework not only maintains stable task
execution but also achieves higher imitation rewards compared to the widely
used AMP+PPO method. These findings highlight the potential of an off-policy IL
formulation for advancing motion generation in robotics.

TL;DR: 提出U-DiT策略，一种基于U形扩散Transformer的机器人控制框架，结合U-Net的多尺度特征融合优势和Transformer的全局上下文建模能力，在仿真和真实机器人任务中均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的机器人控制方法主要采用U-Net架构（DP-U），存在全局上下文建模能力有限和过度平滑伪影的问题，需要改进表示能力和策略表达能力。

Method: 提出U-DiT策略框架，在U-Net架构中集成Transformer，保留多尺度特征融合优势的同时增强全局上下文建模能力。

Result: 在仿真任务中平均性能提升10%，比使用AdaLN块的Transformer扩散策略（DP-T）高6%；在真实机器人任务中平均提升22.5%，在干扰和光照变化下表现出更好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: U-DiT策略作为基于扩散的机器人操作的新基础框架，展现了有效性和实际潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have been acknowledged as a powerful paradigm for
end-to-end visuomotor control in robotics. Most existing approaches adopt a
Diffusion Policy in U-Net architecture (DP-U), which, while effective, suffers
from limited global context modeling and over-smoothing artifacts. To address
these issues, we propose U-DiT Policy, a novel U-shaped Diffusion Transformer
framework. U-DiT preserves the multi-scale feature fusion advantages of U-Net
while integrating the global context modeling capability of Transformers,
thereby enhancing representational power and policy expressiveness. We evaluate
U-DiT extensively across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation
tasks. In simulation, U-DiT achieves an average performance gain of 10\% over
baseline methods and surpasses Transformer-based diffusion policies (DP-T) that
use AdaLN blocks by 6\% under comparable parameter budgets. On real-world
robotic tasks, U-DiT demonstrates superior generalization and robustness,
achieving an average improvement of 22.5\% over DP-U. In addition, robustness
and generalization experiments under distractor and lighting variations further
highlight the advantages of U-DiT. These results highlight the effectiveness
and practical potential of U-DiT Policy as a new foundation for diffusion-based
robotic manipulation.

Result: 在DREAM数据集上达到最先进的姿态估计精度和实时性能；在Libero-Object操作任务中显著提高成功率，即使在严格离线设置下。

Conclusion: PoseDiff为具身AI中的感知、规划和控制提供了可扩展、准确且高效的桥梁。

Abstract: We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state
estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps
raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or
joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage
pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff
extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on
sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and
continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy.
This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception
and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation
tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics
modules, even under strict offline settings. Together, these results show that
PoseDiff provides a scalable, accurate, and efficient bridge between
perception, planning, and control in embodied AI. The video visualization

Abstract: Cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis refers to adaptively generating
and optimizing grasps for various robotic hands with different morphologies.
This capability is crucial for achieving versatile robotic manipulation in
diverse environments and requires substantial amounts of reliable and diverse
grasp data for effective model training and robust generalization. However,
existing approaches either rely on physics-based optimization that lacks
human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection
processes that are limited to anthropomorphic structures. In this paper, we
propose CEDex, a novel cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method at
scale that bridges human grasping kinematics and robot kinematics by aligning
robot kinematic models with generated human-like contact representations. Given
an object's point cloud and an arbitrary robotic hand model, CEDex first
generates human-like contact representations using a Conditional Variational
Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data. It then performs kinematic human
contact alignment through topological merging to consolidate multiple human
hand parts into unified robot components, followed by a signed distance
field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints. Using CEDex, we
construct the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset to date, comprising 500K
objects across four gripper types with 20M total grasps. Extensive experiments
show that CEDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and our dataset
benefits cross-embodiment grasp learning with high-quality diverse grasps.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视人类交接后的动作，依赖限制泛化性的假设，需要解决这一差距以实现任务导向的交接。

Method: 结合LLM推理和部件分割，根据RGB-D图像和任务描述推断相关物体部件，选择优化交接后可用性的抓取方式。

Result: 在零样本设置下实现83%的成功率，用户研究中86%的参与者更偏好该方法，证明其能实现更直观、上下文感知的交接。

Conclusion: LLM-Handover框架通过集成语言模型和视觉感知，显著提升了机器人-人手交接的性能和用户体验。

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration depends on task-oriented handovers, where
robots present objects in ways that support the partners intended use. However,
many existing approaches neglect the humans post-handover action, relying on
assumptions that limit generalizability. To address this gap, we propose
LLM-Handover, a novel framework that integrates large language model
(LLM)-based reasoning with part segmentation to enable context-aware grasp
selection and execution. Given an RGB-D image and a task description, our
system infers relevant object parts and selects grasps that optimize
post-handover usability. To support evaluation, we introduce a new dataset of
60 household objects spanning 12 categories, each annotated with detailed part
labels. We first demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of the
used state-of-the-art part segmentation method, in the context of robot-human
handovers. Next, we show that LLM-Handover achieves higher grasp success rates
and adapts better to post-handover task constraints. During hardware
experiments, we achieve a success rate of 83% in a zero-shot setting over
conventional and unconventional post-handover tasks. Finally, our user study
underlines that our method enables more intuitive, context-aware handovers,
with participants preferring it in 86% of cases.

Abstract: Reliable onboard perception is critical for quadruped robots navigating
dynamic environments, where obstacles can emerge from any direction under
strict reaction-time constraints. Single-sensor systems face inherent
limitations: LiDAR provides omnidirectional coverage but lacks rich texture
information, while cameras capture high-resolution detail but suffer from
restricted field of view. We introduce APREBot (Active Perception System for
Reflexive Evasion Robot), a novel framework that integrates reflexive evasion
with active hierarchical perception. APREBot strategically combines LiDAR-based
omnidirectional scanning with camera-based active focusing, achieving
comprehensive environmental awareness essential for agile obstacle avoidance in
quadruped robots. We validate APREBot through extensive sim-to-real experiments
on a quadruped platform, evaluating diverse obstacle types, trajectories, and
approach directions. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines in both safety metrics and operational efficiency,
highlighting APREBot's potential for dependable autonomy in safety-critical

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SSR-ZSON是一种基于空间语义相对关系的零样本物体导航方法，通过结合平衡空间覆盖和语义密度的视点生成策略与基于LLM的全局引导机制，解决了零样本物体导航中的语义引导不足和空间记忆受限问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本物体导航中的两个关键限制：语义引导不足导致探索效率低下，以及环境结构导致的有限空间记忆使智能体陷入局部区域。

Method: 基于TARE分层探索框架，集成视点生成策略（平衡空间覆盖和语义密度）和基于LLM的全局引导机制。视点生成策略优先选择可遍历子区域内语义密度高的区域，基于LLM的机制评估语义关联以引导导航。

Result: 在Matterport3D和Habitat-Matterport3D数据集上，相比最先进方法，成功率分别提高18.5%和11.2%，路径长度加权成功率分别提高0.181和0.140。在混合Habitat-Gazebo仿真和物理平台上实现实时操作和优越性能。

Conclusion: SSR-ZSON通过创新的视点生成策略和LLM全局引导机制，有效解决了零样本物体导航中的探索效率和局部陷阱问题，在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation in unknown environments presents significant
challenges, mainly due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic guidance
leads to inefficient exploration, while limited spatial memory resulting from
environmental structure causes entrapment in local regions. To address these
issues, we propose SSR-ZSON, a spatial-semantic relative zero-shot object
navigation method based on the TARE hierarchical exploration framework,
integrating a viewpoint generation strategy balancing spatial coverage and
semantic density with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism. The performance
improvement of the proposed method is due to two key innovations. First, the
viewpoint generation strategy prioritizes areas of high semantic density within
traversable sub-regions to maximize spatial coverage and minimize invalid
exploration. Second, coupled with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism, it
assesses semantic associations to direct navigation toward high-value spaces,
preventing local entrapment and ensuring efficient exploration. Deployed on
hybrid Habitat-Gazebo simulations and physical platforms, SSR-ZSON achieves
real-time operation and superior performance. On Matterport3D and
Habitat-Matterport3D datasets, it improves the Success Rate(SR) by 18.5\% and
11.2\%, and the Success weighted by Path Length(SPL) by 0.181 and 0.140,
respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言动作模型由于需要输出适合机器人控制速率的动作，限制了其语言模型的规模，从而影响了处理复杂语言指令的能力，特别是在需要根据相对位置识别目标对象等任务中。

Method: 提出IA-VLA框架，使用大型视觉语言模型作为预处理阶段，生成增强的上下文信息来改进VLA的输入，专门针对视觉重复对象（视觉上无法区分的对象）等语义复杂任务。

Result: 实验表明，增强后的VLA在处理需要从演示中推断概念的复杂语言指令时表现更好，特别是在面对视觉重复对象的场景中。

Conclusion: 利用大型视觉语言模型增强VLA输入的方法能有效提升模型处理复杂语义任务的能力，特别是在需要语言理解推断的场景中。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have become an increasingly popular
approach for addressing robot manipulation problems in recent years. However,
such models need to output actions at a rate suitable for robot control, which
limits the size of the language model they can be based on, and consequently,
their language understanding capabilities. Manipulation tasks may require
complex language instructions, such as identifying target objects by their
relative positions, to specify human intention. Therefore, we introduce IA-VLA,
a framework that utilizes the extensive language understanding of a large
vision language model as a pre-processing stage to generate improved context to
augment the input of a VLA. We evaluate the framework on a set of semantically
complex tasks which have been underexplored in VLA literature, namely tasks
involving visual duplicates, i.e., visually indistinguishable objects. A
dataset of three types of scenes with duplicate objects is used to compare a
baseline VLA against two augmented variants. The experiments show that the VLA
benefits from the augmentation scheme, especially when faced with language
instructions that require the VLA to extrapolate from concepts it has seen in
the demonstrations. For the code, dataset, and videos, see

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用机器人策略在大规模视觉同质数据集上训练容易陷入捷径学习，影响分布外泛化。传统生成式数据增强方法虽然引入多样性，但可能牺牲信息保真度。

Method: 提出CIFT框架，将数据组合视为优化问题，基于数据集特征空间几何定义信息保真度代理指标，识别训练稳定性下降的解相干点。使用MVAug生成因果解缠的数据谱进行调优。

Result: 在π₀和Diffusion Policy等策略架构上应用CIFT，分布外成功率提升超过54%。

Conclusion: 信息保真度感知的数据组合是开发鲁棒通用机器人的重要组成部分，而不仅仅是数据合成本身。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale, visually homogeneous
datasets can be susceptible to shortcut learning, which impairs their
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While generative data augmentation is
a common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data
composition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning
signal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of
information fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on
principled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information
Fidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an
optimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity
based on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the
identification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where
training stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine,
Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled
data spectrum for this tuning process. Applying CIFT to policy architectures
such as $\pi_0$ and Diffusion Policy improves OOD success rates by over 54\%.
These results indicate that fidelity-aware composition, beyond data synthesis
alone, is an important component for developing robust, general-purpose robots.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a key imaging modality for cardiac assessment but remains
highly operator-dependent, and access to trained sonographers is limited in

as a solution; however, clinical studies report longer examination times than
manual procedures, increasing diagnostic delays and operator workload.
Automating non-expert tasks, such as automatically moving the probe to an ideal
starting pose, offers a pathway to reduce this burden. Prior vision- and
depth-based approaches to estimate an initial probe pose are sensitive to
lighting, texture, and anatomical variability. We propose a robot-mounted 2D
LiDAR-based approach that reconstructs the chest surface in 3D and estimates
the initial probe pose automatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first demonstration of robot-mounted 2D LiDAR used for 3D reconstruction of a
human body surface. Through plane-based extrinsic calibration, the
transformation between the LiDAR and robot base frames was estimated with an
overall root mean square (RMS) residual of 1.8 mm and rotational uncertainty
below 0.2{\deg}. The chest front surface, reconstructed from two linear LiDAR
sweeps, was aligned with non-rigid templates to identify an initial probe pose.
A mannequin-based study assessing reconstruction accuracy showed mean surface
errors of 2.78 +/- 0.21 mm. Human trials (N=5) evaluating the proposed approach
found probe initial points typically 20-30 mm from the clinically defined
initial point, while the variation across repeated trials on the same subject
was less than 4 mm.

TL;DR: JuggleRL是首个基于强化学习的空中杂耍系统，通过大规模仿真学习闭环策略，在真实四旋翼上实现零样本部署，平均能连续击球311次，远超基于模型的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空中机器人与物体交互需要在不确定性下执行精确的接触式操作，空中球类杂耍任务需要准确的时机把握、稳定控制和持续适应能力。

Method: 使用系统性校准四旋翼和球体动力学来减小仿真到现实的差距，通过奖励塑造鼓励球拍中心击球和持续杂耍，并进行球位置和恢复系数的领域随机化以增强鲁棒性和可迁移性。

Result: 在真实世界中平均连续击球311次，最高达462次，远超基于模型基线（最多14次，平均3.1次）。还能泛化到未见过的条件，成功杂耍5克轻球，平均145.9次。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够赋予空中机器人在动态交互任务中强大而稳定的控制能力。

Abstract: Aerial robots interacting with objects must perform precise, contact-rich
maneuvers under uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of aerial ball
juggling using a quadrotor equipped with a racket, a task that demands accurate
timing, stable control, and continuous adaptation. We propose JuggleRL, the
first reinforcement learning-based system for aerial juggling. It learns
closed-loop policies in large-scale simulation using systematic calibration of
quadrotor and ball dynamics to reduce the sim-to-real gap. The training
incorporates reward shaping to encourage racket-centered hits and sustained
juggling, as well as domain randomization over ball position and coefficient of
restitution to enhance robustness and transferability. The learned policy
outputs mid-level commands executed by a low-level controller and is deployed
zero-shot on real hardware, where an enhanced perception module with a
lightweight communication protocol reduces delays in high-frequency state
estimation and ensures real-time control. Experiments show that JuggleRL
achieves an average of $311$ hits over $10$ consecutive trials in the real
world, with a maximum of $462$ hits observed, far exceeding a model-based
baseline that reaches at most $14$ hits with an average of $3.1$. Moreover, the
policy generalizes to unseen conditions, successfully juggling a lighter $5$ g
ball with an average of $145.9$ hits. This work demonstrates that reinforcement
learning can empower aerial robots with robust and stable control in dynamic
interaction tasks.

Conclusion: DRCP框架有效解决了协作感知中的硬检测案例问题，为自动驾驶车辆提供了更可靠的情境感知能力。

Abstract: Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything communication has
shown great promise in enhancing situational awareness for autonomous vehicles
and other mobile robotic platforms. Despite recent advances in perception
backbones and multi-agent fusion, real-world deployments remain challenged by
hard detection cases, exemplified by partial detections and noise accumulation
which limit downstream detection accuracy. This work presents Diffusion on
Reinforced Cooperative Perception (DRCP), a real-time deployable framework
designed to address aforementioned issues in dynamic driving environments. DRCP
integrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent,
a cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages
camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and
adaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2)
Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a novel lightweight diffusion-based refinement
module that encourages robustness against feature perturbations and aligns
bird's-eye-view features closer to the task-optimal manifold. The proposed
system achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly
improving robustness under challenging conditions. Code will be released in
late 2025.

Motivation: 传统机器人系统通常只关注障碍物避让，忽视了实现无缝人机交互所需的社会线索，因此需要开发能够识别人类群体交互的社交感知导航系统。

Method: 使用单目RGB-D相机的彩色和深度帧估计3D人体关键点和位置，应用主成分分析(PCA)确定主导交互方向，使用鞋带公式计算兴趣点和参与区域。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别人类群体交互，并可作为ROS 2包轻松集成到现有导航系统中，为社交机器人提供社交感知导航能力。

Abstract: {Recognizing human interactions is essential for social robots as it enables
them to navigate safely and naturally in shared environments. Conventional
robotic systems however often focus on obstacle avoidance, neglecting social
cues necessary for seamless human-robot interaction. To address this gap, we
propose a framework to recognize human group interactions for socially aware
navigation. Our method utilizes color and depth frames from a monocular RGB-D
camera to estimate 3D human keypoints and positions. Principal component
analysis (PCA) is then used to determine dominant interaction directions. The
shoelace formula is finally applied to compute interest points and engagement
areas. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the validity of
the proposed method. The results show that our method is capable of recognizing
group interactions across different scenarios with varying numbers of
individuals. It also achieves high-speed performance, processing each frame in
approximately 4 ms on a single-board computer used in robotic systems. The
method is implemented as a ROS 2 package making it simple to integrate into
existing navigation systems. Source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层框架，结合代码生成视觉语言模型和低层扩散策略，通过将开源机器人API作为结构化监督源，实现机器人行为的模仿和泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人模仿学习在复杂长时程任务中常面临泛化能力有限和数据稀缺的问题，需要更有效的方法来分解和执行任务。

Method: 训练视觉语言模型将任务描述分解为可执行子程序，通过扩散策略模仿相应机器人行为，并引入记忆机制处理非马尔可夫任务。

Result: 该设计实现了可解释的策略分解，相比扁平策略提高了泛化能力，并能分别评估高层规划和低层控制。

Conclusion: 将机器人API作为结构化监督源的分层框架能有效解决模仿学习中的泛化和数据稀缺问题，提升任务执行性能。

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation often suffers from limited
generalization and data scarcity, especially in complex, long-horizon tasks. In
this work, we introduce a hierarchical framework that leverages code-generating
vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with low-level diffusion policies
to effectively imitate and generalize robotic behavior. Our key insight is to
treat open-source robotic APIs not only as execution interfaces but also as
sources of structured supervision: the associated subtask functions - when
exposed - can serve as modular, semantically meaningful labels. We train a VLM
to decompose task descriptions into executable subroutines, which are then
grounded through a diffusion policy trained to imitate the corresponding robot
behavior. To handle the non-Markovian nature of both code execution and certain
real-world tasks, such as object swapping, our architecture incorporates a
memory mechanism that maintains subtask context across time. We find that this
design enables interpretable policy decomposition, improves generalization when
compared to flat policies and enables separate evaluation of high-level
planning and low-level control.

Abstract: Drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), have become powerful tools across
domains-from industry to the arts. In documentary filmmaking, they offer
dynamic, otherwise unreachable perspectives, transforming how stories are told.
Wildlife documentaries especially benefit, yet drones also raise ethical
concerns: the risk of disturbing the animals they aim to capture. This paper
introduces CineWild, an autonomous UAV framework that combines robotics,
cinematography, and ethics. Built on model predictive control, CineWild
dynamically adjusts flight paths and camera settings to balance cinematic
quality with animal welfare. Key features include adaptive zoom for filming
from acoustic and visual safe distances, path-planning that avoids an animal's
field of view, and smooth, low-noise maneuvers. CineWild exemplifies
interdisciplinary innovation-bridging engineering, visual storytelling, and
environmental ethics. We validate the system through simulation studies and
will release the code upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出一种自适应贝叶斯算法，通过意图推断实现实时轨迹预测，能够处理目标意图和运动特性的未知变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实应用中，目标的意图和运动特性通常是未知且可能突然变化的，需要一种能够自适应处理这些变化的实时预测方法。

Method: 使用联合更新技术同时估计目标的当前意图（马尔可夫潜在状态）和意图参数，结合采样机制生成概率性轨迹预测。

Result: 数值实验和硬件演示表明，该方法显著优于非自适应和部分自适应方法，运行频率达270Hz，无需训练或先验知识。

Conclusion: 该算法具有实时性、鲁棒性和广泛适用性，适用于各种机器人系统。

Abstract: This work introduces an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory
prediction via intention inference, where a target's intentions and motion
characteristics are unknown and subject to change. The method concurrently
estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a
Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's
adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update
technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts
and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism
then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with
quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical
experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo
analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly
outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in
real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge
of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出World-Env框架，通过世界模型模拟器替代物理交互，解决VLA模型在数据稀缺场景下的性能下降问题，实现安全高效的强化学习后训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLA模型依赖大规模演示数据，在数据稀缺时性能显著下降；真实环境不可重置的特性限制了强化学习的应用，特别是在高风险工业自动化领域；现有方法缺乏任务完成检测机制，导致冗余动作。

Method: World-Env框架包含两个核心组件：基于视频的世界模拟器生成时间一致的未来视觉观察，以及VLM引导的即时反射器提供连续奖励信号并预测动作终止。

Result: 在复杂机器人操作任务上的实验表明，World-Env仅需每个任务5个专家演示就能获得显著性能提升，有效克服了传统VLA模型的数据低效、安全约束和执行效率问题。

Conclusion: World-Env为资源受限环境下的VLA模型后训练提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，通过虚拟模拟器实现安全探索和泛化能力提升。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer
from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their
reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its
application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of
real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk
domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state
changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA
approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to
redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these
challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that
replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual
simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world
simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and
(2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides
continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated
environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their
initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable
performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task.
Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env
effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and
inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world
interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in
resource-constrained settings.

Motivation: 生成式机器人策略如Flow Matching虽然灵活多模态，但样本效率低。现有物体中心策略未能有效解决此问题。

Method: MSG框架训练多个物体中心策略，在推理时进行组合。该方法与模型无关且仅在推理阶段操作，适用于各种生成式策略和训练范式。

Result: 仅需5个演示即可学习高质量生成式策略，演示需求减少95%，性能比单流方法提升89%。支持零样本物体实例迁移。

Conclusion: MSG框架显著提升生成式机器人策略的样本效率和性能，具有广泛适用性，为实际部署提供实用建议。

Abstract: Generative robot policies such as Flow Matching offer flexible, multi-modal
policy learning but are sample-inefficient. Although object-centric policies
improve sample efficiency, it does not resolve this limitation. In this work,
we propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition
framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at
inference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is
model-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various
generative policies and training paradigms. We perform extensive experiments
both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that our approach learns
high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, resulting
in a 95% reduction in demonstrations, and improves policy performance by 89
percent compared to single-stream approaches. Furthermore, we present
comprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide
practical recommendations for deployment. Finally, MSG enables zero-shot object
instance transfer. We make our code publicly available at

Abstract: Recent advances in one-shot imitation learning have enabled robots to acquire
new manipulation skills from a single human demonstration. While existing
methods achieve strong performance on single-step tasks, they remain limited in
their ability to handle long-horizon, multi-step tasks without additional model

setting provided a single demonstration without additional model training or
manual annotation. We evaluated our method on multi-step and single-step
manipulation tasks where our method achieves an average success rate of 82.5%
and 90%, respectively. Our method matches and exceeds the performance of the
baselines in both these cases. We also compare the performance and
computational efficiency of alternative pre-trained feature extractors within
our framework.

Abstract: As robots transition from controlled settings to unstructured human
environments, building generalist agents that can reliably follow natural
language instructions remains a central challenge. Progress in robust mobile
manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich

sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this
gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset
for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states,
six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a
novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for
hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469
episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is
fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile
manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa
provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of
Vision-Language-Action models. The first version of our dataset is now

Abstract: We present the AgriCruiser, an open-source over-the-row agricultural robot
developed for low-cost deployment and rapid adaptation across diverse crops and
row layouts. The chassis provides an adjustable track width of 1.42 m to 1.57
m, along with a ground clearance of 0.94 m. The AgriCruiser achieves compact
pivot turns with radii of 0.71 m to 0.79 m, enabling efficient headland
maneuvers. The platform is designed for the integration of the other
subsystems, and in this study, a precision spraying system was implemented to
assess its effectiveness in weed management. In twelve flax plots, a single
robotic spray pass reduced total weed populations (pigweed and Venice mallow)
by 24- to 42-fold compared to manual weeding in four flax plots, while also
causing less crop damage. Mobility experiments conducted on concrete, asphalt,
gravel, grass, and both wet and dry soil confirmed reliable traversal
consistent with torque sizing. The complete chassis can be constructed from
commodity T-slot extrusion with minimal machining, resulting in a bill of
materials costing approximately $5,000 - $6,000, which enables replication and
customization. The mentioned results demonstrate that low-cost, reconfigurable
over-the-row robots can achieve effective weed management with reduced crop
damage and labor requirements, while providing a versatile foundation for
phenotyping, sensing, and other agriculture applications. Design files and
implementation details are released to accelerate research and adoption of
modular agricultural robotics.

Conclusion: 重新设计田间几何结构以更好适应自主农业具有巨大潜力，机器人中心布局能显著提升导航效率和协调性能。

Abstract: Conventional linear crop layouts, optimised for tractors, hinder robotic
navigation with tight turns, long travel distances, and perceptual aliasing. We
propose a robot-centric square spiral layout with a central tramline, enabling
simpler motion and more efficient coverage. To exploit this geometry, we
develop a navigation stack combining DH-ResNet18 waypoint regression,
pixel-to-odometry mapping, A* planning, and model predictive control (MPC). In
simulations, the spiral layout yields up to 28% shorter paths and about 25%
faster execution for waypoint-based tasks across 500 waypoints than linear
layouts, while full-field coverage performance is comparable to an optimised
linear U-turn strategy. Multi-robot studies demonstrate efficient coordination
on the spirals rule-constrained graph, with a greedy allocator achieving 33-37%
lower batch completion times than a Hungarian assignment under our setup. These
results highlight the potential of redesigning field geometry to better suit
autonomous agriculture.

Result: 通过大量实验验证，该方法始终优于基线方法，实现了理论上的任务完成率保证。

Conclusion: 提出的规划器是首个能在无需传感器模型知识的情况下，为语义到达-避障任务提供用户指定完成率保证的方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses semantic planning problems in unknown environments under
perceptual uncertainty. The environment contains multiple unknown semantically
labeled regions or objects, and the robot must reach desired locations while
maintaining class-dependent distances from them. We aim to compute robot paths
that complete such semantic reach-avoid tasks with user-defined probability
despite uncertain perception. Existing planning algorithms either ignore
perceptual uncertainty - thus lacking correctness guarantees - or assume known
sensor models and noise characteristics. In contrast, we present the first
planner for semantic reach-avoid tasks that achieves user-specified mission
completion rates without requiring any knowledge of sensor models or noise.
This is enabled by quantifying uncertainty in semantic maps - constructed
on-the-fly from perceptual measurements - using conformal prediction in a
model- and distribution-free manner. We validate our approach and the
theoretical mission completion rates through extensive experiments, showing
that it consistently outperforms baselines in mission success rates.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了"粘性故事"的概念，通过具体、严重、令人惊讶、多样且相关的AI危害叙事，有效吸引非RAI倡导者参与负责任AI实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的负责任AI工具主要吸引RAI倡导者，但无法有效触及非倡导者群体，这些人通常将RAI视为官僚任务而忽视。

Method: 通过实地观察和访谈了解实践者对RAI的看法，基于理论推导设计原则，开发粘性故事，并使用复合AI系统生成和评估这些故事。

Result: 与常规故事相比，粘性故事显著增加了从业者在危害识别上花费的时间，拓宽了识别危害的范围，并促进了更深层次的反思。

Conclusion: 粘性故事是有效吸引非RAI倡导者参与负责任AI实践的有前景方法，能够改变他们对RAI相关性的认知。

Abstract: Responsible AI (RAI) tools -- checklists, templates, and governance processes
-- often engage RAI champions, individuals intrinsically motivated to advocate
ethical practices, but fail to reach non-champions, who frequently dismiss them
as bureaucratic tasks. To explore this gap, we shadowed meetings and
interviewed data scientists at an organization, finding that practitioners
perceived RAI as irrelevant to their work. Building on these insights and
theoretical foundations, we derived design principles for engaging
non-champions, and introduced sticky stories -- narratives of unexpected ML
harms designed to be concrete, severe, surprising, diverse, and relevant,
unlike widely circulated media to which practitioners are desensitized. Using a
compound AI system, we generated and evaluated sticky stories through human and
LLM assessments at scale, confirming they embodied the intended qualities. In a
study with 29 practitioners, we found that, compared to regular stories, sticky
stories significantly increased time spent on harm identification, broadened
the range of harms recognized, and fostered deeper reflection.

*Rayhan Rashed,Farnaz Jahanbakhsh*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: DIY-MOD是一个浏览器扩展，通过个性化内容转换而非内容删除来处理有害内容，提升用户控制感和安全感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式内容审核存在两个问题：无法考虑伤害的主观性，以及对有害内容采取生硬压制，即使这些内容可以被挽救。

Method: 通过形成性访谈了解内容伤害的主观性，开发DIY-MOD浏览器扩展，根据用户自定义的伤害定义实时转换敏感内容元素，提供从模糊化到艺术风格化等多种转换方式。

Result: 两阶段用户研究表明，这种方法增强了用户的控制感和安全感，使他们能够接触之前需要回避的内容和社区。

Conclusion: 个性化内容转换是比集中式内容删除更有效的替代方案，能更好地平衡内容安全和信息价值。

Abstract: Centralized content moderation paradigm both falls short and over-reaches: 1)
it fails to account for the subjective nature of harm, and 2) it acts with
blunt suppression in response to content deemed harmful, even when such content
can be salvaged. We first investigate this through formative interviews,
documenting how seemingly benign content becomes harmful due to individual life
experiences. Based on these insights, we developed DIY-MOD, a browser extension
that operationalizes a new paradigm: personalized content transformation.
Operating on a user's own definition of harm, DIY-MOD transforms sensitive
elements within content in real-time instead of suppressing the content itself.
The system selects the most appropriate transformation for a piece of content
from a diverse palette--from obfuscation to artistic stylizing--to match the
user's specific needs while preserving the content's informational value. Our
two-session user study demonstrates that this approach increases users' sense
of agency and safety, enabling them to engage with content and communities they
previously needed to avoid.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口面临被试间差异大和标记数据有限的问题，通常需要冗长的校准阶段，这限制了其实际应用。

Method: 使用轻量级卷积神经网络，通过被试身份进行条件建模，整合超参数优化策略处理类别不平衡，评估两种条件机制来适应未见被试。

Result: 在时间调制事件相关电位分类任务上，结果显示出改进的泛化能力和数据高效的校准，突显了被试自适应脑机接口的可扩展性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模被试依赖性，实现了更好的泛化性能和更少的数据需求，为脑机接口的实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) suffer from high inter-subject variability
and limited labeled data, often requiring lengthy calibration phases. In this
work, we present an end-to-end approach that explicitly models the subject
dependency using lightweight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) conditioned
on the subject's identity. Our method integrates hyperparameter optimization
strategies that prioritize class imbalance and evaluates two conditioning
mechanisms to adapt pre-trained models to unseen subjects with minimal
calibration data. We benchmark three lightweight architectures on a
time-modulated Event-Related Potentials (ERP) classification task, providing
interpretable evaluation metrics and explainable visualizations of the learned
representations. Results demonstrate improved generalization and data-efficient
calibration, highlighting the scalability and practicality of subject-adaptive
BCIs.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了角色扮演和素养干预在减少外貌线索对社交工程中信任和风险承担影响的效果，但发现干预后没有显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索如何减少外貌线索（如性别、年龄、种族、着装风格）在社交工程情境中对信任和风险承担决策的影响。

Method: 采用4（组别：控制组、素养组、说服者组、被说服者组）×2（时间：前测、后测）混合因子设计，对139名参与者进行为期两周的干预。控制组无干预，素养组学习行为与外貌无关的内容，说服者组学习利用外貌线索影响他人，被说服者组进行角色选择和反思练习。

Result: 干预前后没有发现显著的组内或组间差异，外貌线索对信任和风险承担的影响没有明显减少。

Conclusion: 研究结果对使用素养教育、角色扮演、排练、戏剧和模拟等方法进行去偏见干预的有效性提出了质疑，需要重新考虑这些方法的适用性。

Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of role-taking and literacy-based
interventions in reducing the influence of appearance cues, such as gender,
age, ethnicity, and clothing style, on trust and risk-taking in social
engineering contexts. A-4 (Group: Control, Literacy, Persuader, Persuadee) * 2
(Time: Pre, Post) mixed factorial design was implemented over two weeks with
139 participants. The control group received no material. The literacy group
attended two sessions focused on how behavior can be similar regardless of
appearance cues. The persuader group completed three sessions, learning how to
use such cues to influence others. The persuadee group attended three sessions
involving the selection, justification, and reflection on personas and
scenarios. Scenarios centered on financial and rental advice. A one-week gap
followed before post-intervention testing. In both pre- and post-tests,
participants assessed personas combining appearance cues, offering mobile
hotspots with potential risk. They rated trust and willingness to take the
risk. Validated measures and scenarios were used, including word-of-mouth and
issue involvement scales. It was expected that cue influence would diminish
post-intervention. However, no significant within- or between-group differences
emerged. Findings raise concerns about the effectiveness of debiasing efforts
and call for reconsideration of approaches using literacy, role-taking,
rehearsal, drama, and simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI增强系统在在线社区中广泛使用，但缺乏对该领域的综合梳理。需要清晰理解用户需求、设计决策和评估方法。

Method: 对77项研究进行系统综述，通过三个维度分析：系统要解决的挑战、设计功能性和评估策略，围绕社区参与的四个核心方面组织分析。

Result: 识别了常见的设计和评估模式，提炼出关键设计考虑因素，并突出了未来研究的机遇。

Conclusion: 该综述为AI增强在线社区系统的设计提供了系统性的分析框架，指出了该领域的研究现状和未来发展方向。

Abstract: AI-infused systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing
diverse human needs within online communities. Their widespread adoption has
shaped user experiences and community dynamics at scale. However, designing
such systems requires a clear understanding of user needs, careful design
decisions, and robust evaluation. While research on AI-infused systems for
online communities has flourished in recent years, a comprehensive synthesis of
this space remains absent. In this work, we present a systematic review of 77
studies, analyzing the systems they propose through three lenses: the
challenges they aim to address, their design functionalities, and the
evaluation strategies employed. The first two dimensions are organized around
four core aspects of community participation: contribution, consumption,
mediation, and moderation. Our analysis identifies common design and evaluation
patterns, distills key design considerations, and highlights opportunities for
future research on AI-infused systems in online communities.

*Yuanhao Zhang,Wenbo Li,Xiaoyu Wang,Kangyu Yuan,Shuai Ma,Xiaojuan Ma*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于LLM的AI代理，能够在异步在线讨论中促进知识共建的渐进式发展，通过任务导向和关系导向的干预策略有效推动讨论从浅层信息交换向深度综合发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI干预通常只针对知识共建的孤立阶段，缺乏推动渐进式知识共建的机制，且不同干预风格的影响尚不明确，需要研究如何设计AI代理来持续促进更具建设性的在线讨论。

Method: 通过设计研讨会探索AI干预策略，开发了基于LLM的代理，能够在整个知识共建过程中进行任务导向和/或关系导向的干预，并在60名参与者的组内研究中测试了五个连续异步讨论的效果。

Result: AI代理能够持续促进更深层次的知识发展，不同干预风格对讨论内容和参与者体验产生显著不同的影响。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计自适应AI代理提供了可行指导，能够维持更具建设性的在线讨论，推动知识共建的渐进式发展。

Abstract: Asynchronous online discussions enable diverse participants to co-construct
knowledge beyond individual contributions. This process ideally evolves through
sequential phases, from superficial information exchange to deeper synthesis.
However, many discussions stagnate in the early stages. Existing AI
interventions typically target isolated phases, lacking mechanisms to
progressively advance knowledge co-construction, and the impacts of different
intervention styles in this context remain unclear and warrant investigation.
To address these gaps, we conducted a design workshop to explore AI
intervention strategies (task-oriented and/or relationship-oriented) throughout
the knowledge co-construction process, and implemented them in an LLM-powered
agent capable of facilitating progression while consolidating foundations at
each phase. A within-subject study (N=60) involving five consecutive
asynchronous discussions showed that the agent consistently promoted deeper
knowledge progression, with different styles exerting distinct effects on both
content and experience. These findings provide actionable guidance for
designing adaptive AI agents that sustain more constructive online discussions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EMG手势识别中标记数据稀缺、跨用户差异大以及未见过手势泛化能力差的问题

Method: 提出条件序列生成对抗网络框架，包含角度编码器、双层级上下文编码器（含新颖Ang2Gist单元）、深度卷积EMG生成器和判别器，通过对抗学习联合优化

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的分类器准确率从57.77%降至55.71%；真实+合成数据训练准确率达60.53%，比仅真实数据训练提升2.76%，达到最先进水平

Conclusion: 该框架能有效增强EMG数据集多样性，提高手势识别性能，在神经机器人手控制、AI/AR眼镜和手势虚拟游戏系统等应用中具有重要价值

Abstract: Electromyography (EMG)-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising
approach for human-computer interaction. However, its performance is often
limited by the scarcity of labeled EMG data, significant cross-user
variability, and poor generalization to unseen gestures. To address these
challenges, we propose SeqEMG-GAN, a conditional, sequence-driven generative
framework that synthesizes high-fidelity EMG signals from hand joint angle
sequences. Our method introduces a context-aware architecture composed of an
angle encoder, a dual-layer context encoder featuring the novel Ang2Gist unit,
a deep convolutional EMG generator, and a discriminator, all jointly optimized
via adversarial learning. By conditioning on joint kinematic trajectories,
SeqEMG-GAN is capable of generating semantically consistent EMG sequences, even
for previously unseen gestures, thereby enhancing data diversity and
physiological plausibility. Experimental results show that classifiers trained
solely on synthetic data experience only a slight accuracy drop (from 57.77% to
55.71%). In contrast, training with a combination of real and synthetic data
significantly improves accuracy to 60.53%, outperforming real-only training by
2.76%. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework,also
achieves the state-of-art performance in augmenting EMG datasets and enhancing
gesture recognition performance for applications such as neural robotic hand
control, AI/AR glasses, and gesture-based virtual gaming systems.

Motivation: 众筹作为重要融资渠道面临信任问题和信息不对称的挑战，现有信任增强机制缺乏客观性和鲁棒性，使支持者容易受到偏见信号和项目失败的影响。

Method: 引入Double-Score Voting机制，包含两个维度：专家对项目潜力的细粒度评分投票，以及基于专家可信度和专业水平的加权评分。通过数学形式化并在CertiFund原型平台上实施验证。

Result: 研究发现Double-Score Voting机制能显著减轻信息不对称，提高项目可信度，为创作者和支持者建立更可信的生态系统。

Conclusion: Double-Score Voting机制为众筹平台提供了一种更细致、客观和可靠的项目评估方法，有效解决了信任和信息不对称问题。

Abstract: Crowdfunding has emerged as a vital alternative funding source, transforming
how creative projects and startups secure financing by directly connecting
creators to backers. However, persistent trust issues and information asymmetry
between creators and backers significantly hinder its growth and development.
Existing trust-enhancement mechanisms, such as third-party endorsements and
basic expert validation often lack objectivity and robustness, leaving backers
vulnerable to biased signals and project failures. This paper addresses these
limitations by introducing a novel trust-enhancement mechanism, referred to as
Double-Score Voting. This approach refines expert validation systems by
integrating two critical dimensions: firstly, a granular score-based vote from
experts on a project's potential, moving beyond simple binary approval; and
secondly, a weighted score representing the expert's credibility and level of
expertise. This dual-layered evaluation provides a more nuanced, objective, and
reliable assessment of project viability. The mechanism is formalised
mathematically, and its practical implementation is demonstrated through
CertiFund, a prototype crowdfunding platform developed to test and validate the
concept. The findings of this study demonstrate that the Double-Score Voting
mechanism can significantly mitigate information asymmetry, thereby increasing
the credibility of projects and fostering a more trustworthy ecosystem for both
creators and backers.

Motivation: 解决自闭症和神经典型个体之间因沟通风格差异导致的相互不理解问题，特别是改变目前主要由自闭症个体适应神经典型规范的不平衡状况。

Method: 构建NeuroBridge平台，使用LLMs模拟：(a)直接、字面化的自闭症沟通风格AI角色；(b)四个跨神经类型沟通场景，提供反馈驱动的对话体验。

Result: 12名神经典型参与者的用户研究表明，NeuroBridge提高了他们对自闭症沟通方式的理解，所有参与者都将自闭症视为需要他人理解的社会差异，并认为AI反馈具有建设性、逻辑性和非评判性。

Conclusion: 讨论了AI中残障表征的设计意义、个性化需求以及LLMs在模拟复杂社交场景中的局限性，强调用户可能轻易接受AI生成的对残障的（错误）表征。

Abstract: Communication challenges between autistic and neurotypical individuals stem
from a mutual lack of understanding of each other's distinct, and often
contrasting, communication styles. Yet, autistic individuals are expected to
adapt to neurotypical norms, making interactions inauthentic and mentally
exhausting for them. To help redress this imbalance, we build NeuroBridge, an
online platform that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to simulate: (a) an
AI character that is direct and literal, a style common among many autistic
individuals, and (b) four cross-neurotype communication scenarios in a
feedback-driven conversation between this character and a neurotypical user.
Through NeuroBridge, neurotypical individuals gain a firsthand look at autistic
communication, and reflect on their role in shaping cross-neurotype
interactions. In a user study with 12 neurotypical participants, we find that
NeuroBridge improved their understanding of how autistic people may interpret
language differently, with all describing autism as a social difference that
"needs understanding by others" after completing the simulation. Participants
valued its personalized, interactive format and described AI-generated feedback
as "constructive", "logical" and "non-judgmental". Most perceived the portrayal
of autism in the simulation as accurate, suggesting that users may readily
accept AI-generated (mis)representations of disabilities. To conclude, we
discuss design implications for disability representation in AI, the need for
making NeuroBridge more personalized, and LLMs' limitations in modeling complex
social scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI在日常写作中的普及，教育者、审稿人和读者需要了解AI如何影响写作过程，现有方法往往将这种动态简化为摘要指标或简化来源。

Method: 使用拟物化编码（橡皮屑表示修改强度，遮蔽胶带标记AI生成内容），基于作者-AI交互数据计算协作指标和写作痕迹，并通过形成性研究验证有效性。

Result: 开发了针对不同读者群体的计算逻辑，评估了DraftMarks在评估AI协作写作方面的有效性。

Conclusion: DraftMarks通过熟悉的物理隐喻成功揭示了人机写作过程的动态，为理解AI在写作中的角色提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As generative AI becomes part of everyday writing, questions of transparency
and productive human effort are increasingly important. Educators, reviewers,
and readers want to understand how AI shaped the process. Where was human
effort focused? What role did AI play in the creation of the work? How did the
interaction unfold? Existing approaches often reduce these dynamics to summary
metrics or simplified provenance. We introduce DraftMarks, an augmented reading
tool that surfaces the human-AI writing process through familiar physical
metaphors. DraftMarks employs skeuomorphic encodings such as eraser crumbs to
convey the intensity of revision, and masking tape or smudges to mark
AI-generated content, simulating the process within the final written artifact.
By using data from writer-AI interactions, DraftMarks' algorithm computes
various collaboration metrics and writing traces. Through a formative study, we
identified computational logic for different readership, and evaluated
DraftMarks for its effectiveness in assessing AI co-authored writing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HCI研究主要关注患者在家中的挑战，但对医护团队如何协调出院准备和护理交接，以及沟通和护理路径中的故障如何影响患者康复了解不足。

Method: 在胃肠手术背景下，对13名医疗提供者和4名患者进行了半结构化访谈。

Result: 发现住院和门诊团队之间的协调边界，加上团队内部复杂的组织结构，阻碍了准备患者家庭护理计划和筛选患者信息的"隐形工作"。对患者而言，这些故障导致家庭过渡准备不足和自收集数据碎片化。

Conclusion: 提出了设计机会：正式化任务所有权和交接、情境化共时信号、使护理计划与家庭资源对齐。

Abstract: Post-surgery care involves ongoing collaboration between provider teams and
patients, which starts from post-surgery hospitalization through home recovery
after discharge. While prior HCI research has primarily examined patients'
challenges at home, less is known about how provider teams coordinate discharge
preparation and care handoffs, and how breakdowns in communication and care
pathways may affect patient recovery. To investigate this gap, we conducted
semi-structured interviews with 13 healthcare providers and 4 patients in the
context of gastrointestinal (GI) surgery. We found coordination boundaries
between in- and out-patient teams, coupled with complex organizational
structures within teams, impeded the "invisible work" of preparing patients'
home care plans and triaging patient information. For patients, these
breakdowns resulted in inadequate preparation for home transition and
fragmented self-collected data, both of which undermine timely clinical
decision-making. Based on these findings, we outline design opportunities to
formalize task ownership and handoffs, contextualize co-temporal signals, and
align care plans with home resources.

Motivation: ALS患者随着病情进展会逐渐失去眼球运动功能，导致眼动追踪系统失效，而脑机接口的延迟采用可能因目标导向思维减弱而影响性能

Method: 开发了混合BCI框架，结合ET和基于P300的BCI，提出ET-BCI融合算法实时处理眼动和EEG数据来增强用户意图检测

Result: 5名健康参与者的测试表明，结合两种模态可以维持高准确率

Conclusion: 混合BCI框架可能改善从LIS到CLIS过渡患者的沟通连续性

Abstract: Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) progressively lose
voluntary motor control, often leading to a Locked-In State (LIS), or in severe
cases, a Completely Locked-in State (CLIS). Eye-tracking (ET) systems are
common communication tools in early LIS but become ineffective as oculomotor
function declines. EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a
non-muscular communication alternative, but delayed adoption may reduce
performance due to diminished goal-directed thinking. This study presents a
preliminary hybrid BCI framework combining ET and BCI to support a gradual
transition between modalities. A group of five healthy participants tested a
modified P300-based BCI. Gaze and EEG data were processed in real time, and an
ET-BCI fusion algorithm was proposed to enhance detection of user intention.
Results indicate that combining both modalities may maintain high accuracy and
offers insights on how to potentially improve communication continuity for
patients transitioning from LIS to CLIS.

Abstract: This paper introduces WireBend-kit, a desktop wirebending machine and
computational design tool for creating 3D wireframe structures. Combined, they
allow users to rapidly and inexpensively create custom 3D wireframe structures
from aluminum wire. Our design tool is implemented in freely available software
and allows users to generate virtual wireframe designs and assess their
fabricability. A path-planning procedure automatically converts the wireframe
design into fabrication instructions for our machine while accounting for
material elasticity and kinematic error sources. The custom machine costs $293
in parts and can form aluminum wire into 3D wireframe structures through an
ordered sequence of feed, bend, and rotate instructions. Our technical
evaluation reveals our system's ability to overcome odometrically accumulating
errors inherent to wirebending in order to produce accurate 3D structures from
inexpensive hardware. Finally, we provide application examples demonstrating
the design space enabled by Wirebend-kit.

fall short of human expectations and, critically, lack effective mechanisms for
users to inspect, understand, and control their behaviors. These limitations
call for enhanced transparency, controllability, and human oversight. To
address this, we introduce AIPOM, a system supporting human-in-the-loop
planning through conversational and graph-based interfaces. AIPOM enables users
to transparently inspect, refine, and collaboratively guide LLM-generated
plans, significantly enhancing user control and trust in multi-agent workflows.

Motivation: AI带来隐私风险，但从业者缺乏有效资源来识别和缓解这些风险。

Method: 通过形成性研究开发了Privy工具的两种版本（LLM驱动和模板基础），并通过对照研究评估其效果。

Result: Privy帮助从业者生成高质量的隐私评估，专家认为其能识别相关风险并提出适当缓解策略，LLM版本效果更佳。

Abstract: AI creates and exacerbates privacy risks, yet practitioners lack effective
resources to identify and mitigate these risks. We present Privy, a tool that
guides practitioners through structured privacy impact assessments to: (i)
identify relevant risks in novel AI product concepts, and (ii) propose
appropriate mitigations. Privy was shaped by a formative study with 11
practitioners, which informed two versions -- one LLM-powered, the other
template-based. We evaluated these two versions of Privy through a
between-subjects, controlled study with 24 separate practitioners, whose
assessments were reviewed by 13 independent privacy experts. Results show that
Privy helps practitioners produce privacy assessments that experts deemed high

*Hiroto Tsutsui,Takefumi Hiraki,Yuichi Hiroi,Shoichi Hasegawa*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 基于大规模日志数据对支持头戴显示器的社交VR平台中用户社区结构进行定量分析，发现其具有小型、强内聚、弱互联的特点，与传统SNS的大规模广泛连接社区结构形成对比，并识别出能在社区间起中介作用的"社区跳跃者"用户群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交VR平台中用户社区的结构特征，了解在独特沟通环境下形成的社区结构与用户在其中的角色，与传统社交网络服务进行对比分析。

Method: 基于大规模日志数据，通过检测和评估用户长时间在同一虚拟空间共处所定义的实质性互动数据来分析社区结构。

Result: 发现社交VR平台倾向于形成众多相对较小的社区，具有强内部凝聚力和有限的社区间连接，与传统SNS的大规模广泛连接社区结构形成鲜明对比。识别出能够在社区间起中介作用的"社区跳跃者"用户群体。

Conclusion: 这些发现有助于深入理解社交VR独特沟通环境中涌现的社区结构以及用户在其中扮演的角色，揭示了社交VR社区的小型化、强内聚特征和特殊的中介用户类型。

Abstract: This study quantitatively analyzes the structural characteristics of user
communities within Social Virtual Reality (Social VR) platforms supporting
head-mounted displays (HMDs), based on large-scale log data. By detecting and
evaluating community structures from data on substantial interactions (defined
as prolonged co-presence in the same virtual space), we found that Social VR
platforms tend to host numerous, relatively small communities characterized by
strong internal cohesion and limited inter-community connections. This finding
contrasts with the large-scale, broadly connected community structures
typically observed in conventional Social Networking Services (SNS).
Furthermore, we identified a user segment capable of mediating between
communities, despite these users not necessarily having numerous direct
connections. We term this user segment `community hoppers' and discuss their
characteristics. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the
community structures that emerge within the unique communication environment of
Social VR and the roles users play within them.

TL;DR: 研究通过14天纵向实验，探究用户如何与主动式教练代理互动，发现多样互动模式并识别代理行为问题，为促进有效行为改变提供设计建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解用户与教练式代理（而非助手式）的互动行为及沟通方式，这对设计能促进有意义行为改变的交互至关重要。

Method: 进行14天纵向研究，12名参与者使用主动发起定期检查的代理来支持日常规划和反思。

Result: 发现多样互动模式：参与者接受或协商建议、发展共享心智模型、报告进展，有时抵抗或脱离；识别代理行为问题：僵化、过早轮转、过度承诺。

Conclusion: 增进对人与主动教练式代理互动的理解，并为促进有效行为改变提供设计考虑。

Abstract: Conversational agents have been studied as tools to scaffold planning and
self-reflection for productivity and well-being. While prior work has
demonstrated positive outcomes, we still lack a clear understanding of what
drives these results and how users behave and communicate with agents that act
as coaches rather than assistants. Such understanding is critical for designing
interactions in which agents foster meaningful behavioral change. We conducted
a 14-day longitudinal study with 12 participants using a proactive agent that
initiated regular check-ins to support daily planning and reflection. Our
findings reveal diverse interaction patterns: participants accepted or
negotiated suggestions, developed shared mental models, reported progress, and
at times resisted or disengaged. We also identified problematic aspects of the
agent's behavior, including rigidity, premature turn-taking, and overpromising.
Our work contributes to understanding how people interact with a proactive,
coach-like agent and offers design considerations for facilitating effective
behavioral change.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI为视觉艺术创作提供了新可能，但需要研究这些工具如何帮助新手艺术家在早期创作阶段使用，以及他们如何采纳或抵制这些工具，这会影响艺术社区与生成系统之间的关系。

Method: 访谈13位艺术家了解早期创作需求，开发6个交互原型展示新兴能力，然后与13位新手视觉艺术家进行共同设计工作坊。

Result: 识别出四个关键需求维度：更快速获取参考资料、参考组合的可视化、外部艺术反馈、个性化学习新技法和风格的支持。工作坊中艺术家们明确了以艺术家为中心的AI开发要求和张力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了设计针对新手艺术家工具的机会，这些工具应突出艺术家的需求，为生成式AI服务视觉创造力提供替代愿景。

Abstract: Recent generative AI advances present new possibilities for supporting visual
art creation, but how such promise might assist novice artists during
early-stage processes requires investigation. How novices adopt or resist these
tools can shift the relationship between the art community and generative
systems. We interviewed 13 artists to uncover needs in key dimensions during
early stages of creation: (1) quicker and better access to references, (2)
visualizations of reference combinations, (3) external artistic feedback, and
(4) personalized support to learn new techniques and styles. Mapping such needs
to state-of-the-art open-sourced advances, we developed a set of six
interactive prototypes to expose emerging capabilities to novice artists.
Afterward, we conducted co-design workshops with 13 novice visual artists
through which artists articulated requirements and tensions for artist-centered
AI development. Our work reveals opportunities to design novice-targeted tools
that foreground artists' needs, offering alternative visions for generative AI
to serve visual creativity.

TL;DR: 研究发现VR头手运动数据可以编码细微的认知状态（如困惑、犹豫、准备状态），深度学习模型仅从运动数据就能推断这些状态，性能与人类观察者相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究VR/AR系统中普遍采集的头手运动数据是否能够编码更细微的认知状态，这些状态缺乏明确的运动关联性。

Method: 构建包含结构化决策任务中头手运动数据的新数据集，采用帧级认知状态标注，使用深度时序模型从运动数据推断认知状态。

Result: 深度时序模型能够仅从运动数据中准确推断细微认知状态，性能与人类观察者相当，表明标准VR遥测数据包含与用户内部认知过程相关的强模式。

Conclusion: VR运动数据能够有效反映用户的内部认知状态，这为开发新一代自适应虚拟环境打开了大门，数据集和建模框架将公开以支持未来研究。

Abstract: As virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) continue to gain
popularity, head and hand motion data captured by consumer VR systems have
become ubiquitous. Prior work shows that such telemetry can be highly
identifying and reflect broad user traits, often aligning with intuitive "folk
theories" of body language. However, it remains unclear to what extent motion
kinematics encode more nuanced cognitive states, such as confusion, hesitation,
and readiness, which lack clear correlates with motion. To investigate this, we
introduce a novel dataset of head and hand motion with frame-level annotations
of these states collected during structured decision-making tasks. Our findings
suggest that deep temporal models can infer subtle cognitive states from motion
alone, achieving comparable performance with human observers. This work
demonstrates that standard VR telemetry contains strong patterns related to
users' internal cognitive processes, which opens the door for a new generation
of adaptive virtual environments. To enhance reproducibility and support future
work, we will make our dataset and modeling framework publicly available.

TL;DR: 使用多模态大语言模型通过大规模相似性判断生成的情感表示能更好地预测人脑情感处理网络的活动，超越了仅基于语言模型和人类行为评分的表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感研究中行为-神经差距的问题，即人类自我报告难以准确预测大脑活动，探索大规模相似性判断是否能更准确地捕捉大脑的情感几何结构。

Method: 使用AI模型作为认知代理，从多模态大语言模型和纯语言模型中收集对2,180个情感激发视频的百万级三元组判断，生成30维嵌入表示。

Result: 多模态大语言模型生成的情感表示在预测人类情感处理网络神经活动方面准确率最高，不仅优于纯语言模型，还出乎意料地优于直接来自人类行为评分的表示。

Conclusion: 感官基础（从丰富视觉数据中学习）对于发展真正与神经对齐的情感概念框架至关重要，多模态大语言模型能自主开发丰富且与神经对齐的情感表示，为连接主观体验与神经基础提供了强大范式。

Abstract: The ability to represent emotion plays a significant role in human cognition
and social interaction, yet the high-dimensional geometry of this affective
space and its neural underpinnings remain debated. A key challenge, the
`behavior-neural gap,' is the limited ability of human self-reports to predict
brain activity. Here we test the hypothesis that this gap arises from the
constraints of traditional rating scales and that large-scale similarity
judgments can more faithfully capture the brain's affective geometry. Using AI
models as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out
judgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only
model (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos. We found that
the emergent 30-dimensional embeddings from these models are highly
interpretable and organize emotion primarily along categorical lines, yet in a
blended fashion that incorporates dimensional properties. Most remarkably, the
MLLM's representation predicted neural activity in human emotion-processing
networks with the highest accuracy, outperforming not only the LLM but also,
counterintuitively, representations derived directly from human behavioral
ratings. This result supports our primary hypothesis and suggests that sensory
grounding--learning from rich visual data--is critical for developing a truly
neurally-aligned conceptual framework for emotion. Our findings provide
compelling evidence that MLLMs can autonomously develop rich, neurally-aligned
affective representations, offering a powerful paradigm to bridge the gap
between subjective experience and its neural substrates. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大语言模型与人类大脑活动之间的相似性对于推进人工智能和认知神经科学都至关重要，需要进行多语言、大规模的系统性评估。

Method: 使用岭回归评估LLM嵌入与脑电图信号之间的表征相似性，分析"神经轨迹"与"LLM潜在轨迹"的相似性，捕捉关键动态模式如幅度、角度、不确定性和置信度。

Result: 发现：(1) LLMs的中高层对语义整合至关重要，对应于EEG中观察到的N400成分；(2) 大脑在阅读时表现出连续迭代处理，而LLMs则显示离散的阶段末活动爆发，表明两者在实时语义处理动态上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLMs和神经处理提供了新见解，并为未来研究人工智能与生物智能之间的对齐建立了关键框架。

Abstract: Understanding the similarity between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity is crucial for advancing both AI and cognitive neuroscience. In
this study, we provide a multilinguistic, large-scale assessment of this
similarity by systematically comparing 16 publicly available pretrained LLMs
with human brain responses during natural language processing tasks in both
English and Chinese. Specifically, we use ridge regression to assess the
representational similarity between LLM embeddings and electroencephalography
(EEG) signals, and analyze the similarity between the "neural trajectory" and
the "LLM latent trajectory." This method captures key dynamic patterns, such as
magnitude, angle, uncertainty, and confidence. Our findings highlight both
similarities and crucial differences in processing strategies: (1) We show that
middle-to-high layers of LLMs are central to semantic integration and
correspond to the N400 component observed in EEG; (2) The brain exhibits
continuous and iterative processing during reading, whereas LLMs often show
discrete, stage-end bursts of activity, which suggests a stark contrast in
their real-time semantic processing dynamics. This study could offer new
insights into LLMs and neural processing, and also establish a critical
framework for future investigations into the alignment between artificial
intelligence and biological intelligence.

Motivation: 旨在将文化美学洞察与计算建模相结合，为艺术家、研究人员和AI系统提供共享语言和可解释工具，促进有意义的合作，而不是将创造力简化为数字。

Method: 基于心理学理论和艺术家访谈定义12个创造力特质，使用GPT-4.1对SemArt数据集中的2万件艺术品进行标注，评估从CLIP图像嵌入中学习这些特质的可行性。

Result: 环境对话性和救赎弧等特质能够可靠预测（R²≈0.64-0.68），而记忆印记等特质仍然具有挑战性，揭示了纯视觉编码的局限性。

Conclusion: 通过连接文化美学洞察与计算建模，该工作提供了共享语言和可解释工具，支持艺术家、研究人员和AI系统之间的有意义合作。

Abstract: We introduce a psychologically grounded and artist-informed framework for
modeling visual creativity across four domains: Inner, Outer, Imaginative, and
Moral Worlds. Drawing on interviews with practicing artists and theories from
psychology, we define 12 traits that capture affective, symbolic, cultural, and
ethical dimensions of creativity.Using 20k artworks from the SemArt dataset, we
annotate images with GPT 4.1 using detailed, theory-aligned prompts, and
evaluate the learnability of these traits from CLIP image embeddings. Traits
such as Environmental Dialogicity and Redemptive Arc are predicted with high
reliability ($R^2 \approx 0.64 - 0.68$), while others like Memory Imprint
remain challenging, highlighting the limits of purely visual encoding. Beyond
technical metrics, we visualize a "creativity trait-space" and illustrate how
it can support interpretable, trait-aware co-creation - e.g., sliding along a
Redemptive Arc axis to explore works of adversity and renewal. By linking
cultural-aesthetic insights with computational modeling, our work aims not to
reduce creativity to numbers, but to offer shared language and interpretable
tools for artists, researchers, and AI systems to collaborate meaningfully.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NASA-TLX是可视化研究中常用的用户工作量评估指标，但通常省略了工作量来源评估部分，本研究旨在调查不同版本NASA-TLX在元研究中的管理任务负荷。

Method: 通过在线调查，使用ReVISit框架进行元研究，比较完整版和简化版NASA-TLX的管理任务负荷。

Result: 完整版TLX相比简化版略微增加任务负荷，主要原因是参与者对程序的挫败感而非时间增加；但完整版能提供更全面、多维度的工作量数据。

Conclusion: 建议使用紧凑版工作量来源问卷，既能减少时间损失和参与者挫败感，又能提供与原始程序相同的数据质量。

Abstract: The NASA task load index (short: NASA-TLX) is a common metric to evaluate the
workload of a user in a visualization study. Yet, it is rarely performed as
initially intended, as the sources-of-workload evaluation is often omitted for
various reasons. We conduct an online survey to investigate the task load of
administering different versions of the NASA-TLX in a meta-study using the
ReVISit framework. Our results show that it is not the slight increase in
experiment time, but rather participants' frustration with the procedure, that
contributes to the slight increase in task load when using the full version of
the TLX compared to using a shortened version. However, we also show that the
full version can shine a different and more faceted light on workload by adding
a personal dimension to the data. We propose that a compact version of the
sources-of-workload questionnaire can mitigate both time loss and frustration
for study participants, while still providing the same data as the original
procedure. The online study can be found and interactively explored on
https://dpahr.github.io/tlxtlx/, and the source for the study, as well as the

Motivation: 解决sEEG信号固有的非平稳性导致的训练与测试间域偏移问题，提高脑机接口的临床适用性和解码可靠性。

Method: 1. 多尺度可分解混合(MDM)模块：学习sEEG信号的稳定多时间尺度表示；2. 无源在线测试时适应(TTA)：通过熵最小化在推理时适应分布偏移。

Result: 在DU-IN口语单词解码基准测试中优于最先进模型，特别是在具有挑战性的情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 结合不变特征学习和在线适应是开发可靠脑机接口系统的有效策略。

Abstract: Decoding speech from stereo-electroencephalography (sEEG) signals has emerged
as a promising direction for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Its clinical
applicability, however, is limited by the inherent non-stationarity of neural
signals, which causes domain shifts between training and testing, undermining
decoding reliability. To address this challenge, a two-stage framework is
proposed for enhanced robustness. First, a multi-scale decomposable mixing
(MDM) module is introduced to model the hierarchical temporal dynamics of
speech production, learning stable multi-timescale representations from sEEG
signals. Second, a source-free online test-time adaptation (TTA) method
performs entropy minimization to adapt the model to distribution shifts during
inference. Evaluations on the public DU-IN spoken word decoding benchmark show
that the approach outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in
challenging cases. This study demonstrates that combining invariant feature
learning with online adaptation is a principled strategy for developing
reliable BCI systems. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注生成型AI与设计师的协作，但对支持创意流程中收敛过程的决策型AI协作理解有限，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 在一家在线广告设计公司进行案例研究，通过访谈12位专业平面设计师，了解他们对决策型AI影响创意工作实践的看法。

Result: 研究发现设计师如何信任和依赖AI、感知到的益处与挑战，以及他们应对挑战的策略。

Conclusion: 基于研究发现，提出了将决策型AI整合到创意设计流程中的设计建议。

Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has fundamentally
transformed creative work practices in the design industry. Existing studies
have identified both opportunities and challenges for creative practitioners in
their collaboration with generative AI and explored ways to facilitate
effective human-AI co-creation. However, there is still a limited understanding
of designers' collaboration with AI that supports creative processes distinct
from generative AI. To address these gaps, this study focuses on understanding
designers' collaboration with decision-making AI, which supports the
convergence process in the creative workflow, as opposed to the divergent
process supported by generative AI. Specifically, we conducted a case study at
an online advertising design company to explore how professional graphic
designers at the company perceive the impact of decision-making AI on their
creative work practices. The case company incorporated an AI system that
predicts the effectiveness of advertising design into the design workflow as a
decision-making support tool. Findings from interviews with 12 designers
identified how designers trust and rely on AI, its perceived benefits and
challenges, and their strategies for navigating the challenges. Based on the
findings, we discuss design recommendations for integrating decision-making AI
into the creative design workflow.

Motivation: 探索中等规模LLM在消费级硬件上的实用性，特别是在小型工作室或家庭环境中支持游戏设计过程。

Method: 识别10个游戏概念关键要素，用ChatGPT生成30个游戏想法，然后让三个中等规模LLM（LLaMA 3.1、Qwen 2.5、DeepSeek-R1）根据这些要素评估想法，并进行定性比较。

Result: DeepSeek-R1产生了最一致有用的反馈，尽管质量存在变异性。学生用户研究显示大多数参与者认为输出质量高，并愿意在工作流程中使用此类工具。

Conclusion: 当前中等规模LLM能在早期游戏设计中提供有价值反馈，但提示方法的进一步改进可提高一致性和整体效果。

Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can
support experts across various domains, including game design. In this study,
we examine the utility of medium-sized LLMs, models that operate on
consumer-grade hardware typically available in small studios or home
environments. We began by identifying ten key aspects that contribute to a
strong game concept and used ChatGPT to generate thirty sample game ideas.
Three medium-sized LLMs, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and DeepSeek-R1, were then
prompted to evaluate these ideas according to the previously identified
aspects. A qualitative assessment by two researchers compared the models'
outputs, revealing that DeepSeek-R1 produced the most consistently useful
feedback, despite some variability in quality. To explore real-world
applicability, we ran a pilot study with ten students enrolled in a
storytelling course for game development. At the early stages of their own
projects, students used our prompt and DeepSeek-R1 to refine their game
concepts. The results indicate a positive reception: most participants rated
the output as high quality and expressed interest in using such tools in their
workflows. These findings suggest that current medium-sized LLMs can provide
valuable feedback in early game design, though further refinement of prompting
methods could improve consistency and overall effectiveness.

Abstract: In emergencies, treatment needs to be fast, accu-rate and patient-specific.
For instance, in emergency scenarios, obstacles like treatment environments and
medical difficulties can lead to bad outcomes for patients. Additionally, a
drastic change of health vitals can force paramedics to shift to a different
treatment in the ongoing treatment of the patient in order to save a patient's
life. The KIRETT (engl.: 'Artificial intelligence in rescue operations')
demonstrator is developed to provide a rescue operator with a wrist-worn
device, enabling treatment recommendation (with the help of knowledge graph)
with situation detection models to improve the emergency treatment of a
patient. This paper aims to provide a qualitative evaluation of the 2-days
testing in the KIRETT project with the focus of knowledge graphs, knowledge

judging, and recovering from model errors or unexpected behavior); participants
completed a contextual fit evaluation to assess whether and how they would use
the tools, which document types, and at what stages in their work. Our analysis
details limitations and challenges in workflows, domain-specific feedback on

TL;DR: 研究性别-颜色刻板关联在可视化决策任务中的影响，发现在有图例时会导致内群体偏袒，但无图例时这种偏袒消失且出现非刻板颜色的轻微影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解在性别数据可视化中使用刻板颜色（如粉色代表女性、蓝色代表男性）对读者和决策者的偏见影响，帮助设计师在易产生刻板印象的语境中更好地选择颜色。

Method: 通过两个众包实验，评估颜色与性别的关联（刻板vs非刻板）如何影响用户在薪资调整分配决策中的决定。

Result: 当数据可视化中有明确表达颜色-性别关联的图例时，会导致内群体偏袒；但在没有图例的情况下，这种内群体偏袒消失，并观察到非刻板颜色的轻微影响。

Conclusion: 可视化中颜色-性别关联的明确表达会引发内群体偏袒，而避免这种明确关联可以减轻刻板印象对决策的影响。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of stereotyped gender-color associations in a
visualization-driven decision-making task. In the context of gender data
visualization, the well-known "pink for girls and blue for boys" color
assignment is associated with stereotypes that could bias readers and
decision-makers. Understanding the effects of using stereotyped colors in
visualizations for decision-making can help designers better choose colors in
stereotype-prone contexts. We therefore explore the potential impact of
stereotyped colors on compensation decision-making through two crowdsourced
experiments. In these experiments, we evaluate how the association of color
with gender (stereotyped vs non-stereotyped) affects the user's allocation
decisions in the context of salary adjustments. Our results indicate that
explicit expression of the color-gender associations, in the form of a legend
on the data visualization, leads to in-group favoritism. However, in the
absence of a legend, this in-group favoritism disappears, and a small effect of

### [859] [Training Deep Normalization-Free Spiking Neural Networks with Lateral Inhibition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23253)
*Peiyu Liu,Jianhao Ding,Zhaofei Yu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需显式归一化的脉冲神经网络学习框架，通过侧向抑制机制实现稳定训练，在保持生物真实性的同时达到竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度SNN训练中依赖显式归一化方案（如批归一化）导致的性能与生物真实性之间的权衡问题

Method: 采用受皮层电路启发的侧向抑制机制，用包含兴奋性和抑制性神经元的电路替代传统前馈SNN层，提出E-I Init参数初始化方案和E-I Prop梯度传播技术

Result: 在多个数据集和网络架构上的实验表明，该框架能够稳定训练具有生物真实性的深度SNN，且无需显式归一化即可达到竞争性性能

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了训练深度SNN的解决方案，还为在大规模皮层计算中进一步探索侧向抑制功能提供了计算平台

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention as a
central paradigm in neuromorphic computing, owing to their energy efficiency
and biological plausibility. However, training deep SNNs has critically
depended on explicit normalization schemes, such as batch normalization,
leading to a trade-off between performance and biological realism. To resolve
this conflict, we propose a normalization-free learning framework that
incorporates lateral inhibition inspired by cortical circuits. Our framework
replaces the traditional feedforward SNN layer with a circuit of distinct
excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons that complies with Dale's law. The
circuit dynamically regulates neuronal activity through subtractive and
divisive inhibition, which respectively control the activity and the gain of
excitatory neurons. To enable and stabilize end-to-end training of the
biologically constrained SNN, we propose two key techniques: E-I Init and E-I
Prop. E-I Init is a dynamic parameter initialization scheme that balances
excitatory and inhibitory inputs while performing gain control. E-I Prop
decouples the backpropagation of the E-I circuits from the forward propagation
and regulates gradient flow. Experiments across several datasets and network
architectures demonstrate that our framework enables stable training of deep
SNNs with biological realism and achieves competitive performance without
resorting to explicit normalizations. Therefore, our work not only provides a
solution to training deep SNNs but also serves a computational platform for
further exploring the functions of lateral inhibition in large-scale cortical
computation.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 首次将脉冲神经网络应用于基于雷达的飞机引导信号分类，提出混合架构结合卷积模块和LIF神经元，在减少88%参数的同时保持高精度，并验证了SNN在雷达HAR中的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于雷达的人类活动识别具有隐私保护和鲁棒性优势，但现有方法计算量大，难以在边缘设备部署。需要寻找更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出新颖的混合架构：使用卷积模块提取空间特征，结合Leaky Integrate-and-Fire神经元进行时序处理，有效捕捉手势动态。

Result: 与基线相比，模型减少了88%的可训练参数，准确率损失低于1%，并在Soli手势数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过系统比较证明SNN在准确率、延迟、内存和能耗方面的权衡优势，确立了SNN作为雷达HAR高效且具竞争力的解决方案。

Abstract: Radar-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) offers privacy and robustness
over camera-based methods, yet remains computationally demanding for edge
deployment. We present the first use of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for
radar-based HAR on aircraft marshalling signal classification. Our novel hybrid
architecture combines convolutional modules for spatial feature extraction with
Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for temporal processing, inherently
capturing gesture dynamics. The model reduces trainable parameters by 88\% with
under 1\% accuracy loss compared to baselines, and generalizes well to the Soli
gesture dataset. Through systematic comparisons with Artificial Neural
Networks, we demonstrate the trade-offs of spiking computation in terms of
accuracy, latency, memory, and energy, establishing SNNs as an efficient and
competitive solution for radar-based HAR.

### [861] [Network-Optimised Spiking Neural Network for Event-Driven Networking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23516)
*Muhammad Bilal*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了网络优化脉冲（NOS）模型，一种紧凑的双变量脉冲单元，专为边缘网络中的异常检测、路由控制和拥塞管理等时间关键任务设计。该模型通过饱和非线性强制有限缓冲区，支持可训练和部署的两种可微重置方案，在队列基准测试中表现出色，并在闭环控制和零样本预测中实现低抖动和及时拥塞检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的脉冲神经网络单元（如Hodgkin-Huxley、Izhikevich和随机神经网络）不适合时间关键的网络任务。需要一种紧凑的脉冲模型来满足边缘网络中异常检测、本地路由控制和拥塞管理的需求。

Method: 引入网络优化脉冲（NOS）模型，使用两个变量编码归一化队列占用和恢复资源。采用饱和非线性强制有限缓冲区，服务速率泄漏，以及具有延迟和可选每链路门的图局部输入。支持两种可微重置方案用于训练和部署。

Result: NOS在校准后匹配M/M/1队列均值，同时在突发输入下截断深度尾部。在闭环控制中实现低抖动和快速稳定。在零样本无标签预测中，从到达统计中校准每个节点，实现高AUROC/AUPRC，及时检测拥塞开始且误报率低。在链状、星形和无标度拓扑中，NOS在早期预警F1和检测延迟方面优于MLP、RNN、GRU和tGNN。

Conclusion: NOS是一种专为网络任务优化的紧凑脉冲模型，通过理论分析和实验验证了其在队列管理、拥塞检测和控制方面的优越性能，为资源受限部署提供了数据驱动初始化、代理梯度训练和显式稳定性检查的指导。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks offer event-driven computation suited to
time-critical networking tasks such as anomaly detection, local routing
control, and congestion management at the edge. Classical units, including
Hodgkin-Huxley, Izhikevich, and the Random Neural Network, map poorly to these
needs. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a compact two-variable
unit whose state encodes normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource.
The model uses a saturating nonlinearity to enforce finite buffers, a
service-rate leak, and graph-local inputs with delays and optional per link
gates. It supports two differentiable reset schemes for training and
deployment. We give conditions for equilibrium existence and uniqueness, local
stability tests from the Jacobian trace and determinant, and a network
threshold that scales with the Perron eigenvalue of the coupling matrix. The
analysis yields an operational rule g* ~ k* rho(W) linking damping and offered
load, shows how saturation enlarges the stable region, and explains finite-size
smoothing of synchrony onsets. Stochastic arrivals follow a Poisson shot-noise
model aligned with telemetry smoothing. Against queueing baselines, NOS matches
M/M/1 mean by calibration while truncating deep tails under bursty input. In
closed loop it gives, low-jitte with short settling. In zero-shot, label-free
forecasting NOS is calibrated per node from arrival statistics. Its NOS
dynamics yield high AUROC/AUPRC, enabling timely detection of congestion onsets
with few false positives. Under a train-calibrated residual protocol across
chain, star, and scale-free topologies, NOS improves early-warning F1 and
detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and tGNN. We provide guidance for
data-driven initialisation, surrogate-gradient training with a homotopy on
reset sharpness, and explicit stability checks with topology-aware bounds for
resource constrained deployments.

### [862] [Accuracy-Robustness Trade Off via Spiking Neural Network Gradient Sparsity Trail](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23762)
*Nhan T. Luu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: SNNs在特定架构下自然具有梯度稀疏性，无需显式正则化即可实现最先进的对抗防御性能，但存在鲁棒性与泛化性的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNNs因其能效和内存占用优势而受到关注，但其对抗鲁棒性研究尚不充分。现有研究通过稀疏梯度正则化来增强鲁棒性，本文探索SNNs是否天然具备这种特性。

Method: 研究发现特定架构配置下SNNs自然表现出梯度稀疏性，无需额外正则化即可实现对抗防御。

Result: SNNs在特定配置下能达到最先进的对抗防御性能，但发现鲁棒性与泛化性存在权衡：稀疏梯度增强鲁棒性但损害泛化能力，稠密梯度支持泛化但增加攻击脆弱性。

Conclusion: SNNs天然具备梯度稀疏性，无需显式正则化即可实现强大对抗防御，但需要在鲁棒性和泛化性之间进行权衡设计。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted growing interest in both
computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, primarily due to their
inherent energy efficiency and compact memory footprint. However, achieving
adversarial robustness in SNNs, particularly for vision-related tasks, remains
a nascent and underexplored challenge. Recent studies have proposed leveraging
sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against
adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under
specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity
and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the
need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off
between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to
improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to
generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but
increase vulnerability to attacks.

### [863] [CaRe-BN: Precise Moving Statistics for Stabilizing Spiking Neural Networks in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23791)
*Zijie Xu,Xinyu Shi,Yiting Dong,Zihan Huang,Zhaofei Yu*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了CaRe-BN方法，通过置信度自适应更新和分布重新校准机制，解决了SNN在在线强化学习中因BN统计不准确导致的收敛慢和策略次优问题，显著提升了SNN性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNN在神经形态硬件上具有低延迟和能效优势，但直接训练的SNN依赖BN来稳定梯度更新。在在线强化学习中，不准确的BN统计会阻碍利用，导致收敛慢和策略次优，限制了SNN在资源受限设备上的应用。

Method: 提出CaRe-BN方法，包含两个关键机制：(i) 置信度引导的自适应更新策略用于BN统计；(ii) 重新校准机制来对齐分布。该方法提供更准确的归一化，稳定SNN优化而不干扰RL训练过程。

Result: 在连续控制基准测试中，CaRe-BN将SNN性能提升高达22.6%，且在不同脉冲神经元模型和RL算法中均有效。配备CaRe-BN的SNN甚至比ANN对应物高出5.9%。

Conclusion: CaRe-BN为RL定制的BN技术开辟了新方向，为实现既高效又高性能的神经形态智能体铺平了道路，同时保持了SNN在部署时的能效优势。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer low-latency and energy-efficient
decision-making on neuromorphic hardware by mimicking the event-driven dynamics
of biological neurons. However, due to the discrete and non-differentiable
nature of spikes, directly trained SNNs rely heavily on Batch Normalization
(BN) to stabilize gradient updates. In online Reinforcement Learning (RL),
imprecise BN statistics hinder exploitation, resulting in slower convergence
and suboptimal policies. This challenge limits the adoption of SNNs for
energy-efficient control on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this, we
propose Confidence-adaptive and Re-calibration Batch Normalization (CaRe-BN),
which introduces (\emph{i}) a confidence-guided adaptive update strategy for BN
statistics and (\emph{ii}) a re-calibration mechanism to align distributions.
By providing more accurate normalization, CaRe-BN stabilizes SNN optimization
without disrupting the RL training process. Importantly, CaRe-BN does not alter
inference, thus preserving the energy efficiency of SNNs in deployment.
Extensive experiments on continuous control benchmarks demonstrate that CaRe-BN
improves SNN performance by up to $22.6\%$ across different spiking neuron
models and RL algorithms. Remarkably, SNNs equipped with CaRe-BN even surpass
their ANN counterparts by $5.9\%$. These results highlight a new direction for
BN techniques tailored to RL, paving the way for neuromorphic agents that are
both efficient and high-performing.

*Nhan T. Luu,Duong T. Luu,Pham Ngoc Nam,Truong Cong Thang*

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的混合ANN-SNN框架，通过使用替代梯度实现位平面编码函数的端到端可微分训练，实现了ANN和SNN层的深度协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的混合ANN-SNN方法由于尖峰编码函数的不可微分性，通常采用严格分离的组件或SNN编码器+ANN分类器的结构，缺乏反向传播过程中的深度层间协作。

Method: 在传统ANN管道中集成层级的编码-解码SNN块，使用替代梯度实现位平面尖峰编码函数的可微分训练，支持端到端训练。

Result: 该方法在保持尖峰计算效率和时序表示优势的同时，达到了与最先进纯ANN和SNN模型相竞争的准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首次在混合ANN-SNN背景下实现位平面编码的替代梯度，开创了一类新的混合模型，为未来研究指明了新方向。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant traction in both
computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence for their potential in
energy-efficient computing. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs)
excel at gradient-based optimization and high accuracy. This contrast has
consequently led to a growing subfield of hybrid ANN-SNN research. However,
existing hybrid approaches often rely on either a strict separation between ANN
and SNN components or employ SNN-only encoders followed by ANN classifiers due
to the constraints of non-differentiability of spike encoding functions,
causing prior hybrid architectures to lack deep layer-wise cooperation during
backpropagation. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN
framework that integrates layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks within
conventional ANN pipelines. Central to our method is the use of surrogate
gradients for a bit-plane-based spike encoding function, enabling end-to-end
differentiable training across ANN and SNN layers. This design achieves
competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models while
retaining the potential efficiency and temporal representation benefits of
spiking computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
implementation of a surrogate gradient for bit plane coding specifically and
spike encoder interface in general to be utilized in the context of hybrid
ANN-SNN, successfully leading to a new class of hybrid models that pave new
directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型增加了计算需求，现有AI系统与生物计算系统存在差距，需要自然智能的进一步启发来增强AI的多样性和适应性。

Method: 通过比较生物计算系统与人工计算系统的元素，分析尚未被AI有效利用的自然智能机制，识别NI启发的机会领域。

Result: 识别出自然智能中尚未被AI有效利用的机制，为AI硬件和软件的改进提供了具体方向。

Conclusion: 进一步从自然智能中获取灵感对于增强人工智能系统的能力、适应现实环境和特定应用场景是必要的。

Abstract: The introduction of large language models has significantly expanded global
demand for computing; addressing this growing demand requires novel approaches
that introduce new capabilities while addressing extant needs. Although
inspiration from biological systems served as the foundation on which modern
artificial intelligence (AI) was developed, many modern advances have been made
without clear parallels to biological computing. As a result, the ability of
techniques inspired by "natural intelligence" (NI) to inflect modern AI systems
may be questioned. However, by analyzing remaining disparities between AI and
NI, we argue that further biological inspiration is indeed necessary to
diversify the capabilities of artificial systems and enable them to succeed in
real-world environments and adapt to niche applications. To elucidate which NI
mechanisms can contribute toward this goal, we review and compare elements of
biological and artificial computing systems, emphasizing areas of NI that have
not yet been effectively captured by AI. We then suggest areas of opportunity
for NI-inspired mechanisms that can inflect AI hardware and software.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: PredNext是一个用于脉冲神经网络的无监督学习模块，通过跨视角的未来步预测和片段预测来建模时序关系，显著提升了SNN在视频数据上的表示学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督SNN主要采用浅层架构或局部可塑性规则，难以建模长程时序依赖和保持时序特征一致性，导致语义表示不稳定，阻碍了深度无监督SNN在大规模时序视频数据上的发展。

Method: 提出PredNext模块，通过跨视角的未来步预测和片段预测来显式建模时序关系，该即插即用模块可与多种自监督目标无缝集成。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和MiniKinetics等大规模数据集上建立了SNN自监督学习基准，PredNext在不同任务和自监督方法中均带来显著性能提升，仅通过UCF101无监督训练即可达到与ImageNet预训练监督权重相当的性能。

Conclusion: PredNext显著改善了时序特征一致性并增强了网络泛化能力，为大规模时序视频数据上的无监督深度SNN提供了有效基础。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their temporal processing capabilities
and biologically plausible dynamics, offer a natural platform for unsupervised
representation learning. However, current unsupervised SNNs predominantly
employ shallow architectures or localized plasticity rules, limiting their
ability to model long-range temporal dependencies and maintain temporal feature
consistency. This results in semantically unstable representations, thereby
impeding the development of deep unsupervised SNNs for large-scale temporal
video data. We propose PredNext, which explicitly models temporal relationships
through cross-view future Step Prediction and Clip Prediction. This
plug-and-play module seamlessly integrates with diverse self-supervised
objectives. We firstly establish standard benchmarks for SNN self-supervised
learning on UCF101, HMDB51, and MiniKinetics, which are substantially larger
than conventional DVS datasets. PredNext delivers significant performance
improvements across different tasks and self-supervised methods. PredNext
achieves performance comparable to ImageNet-pretrained supervised weights
through unsupervised training solely on UCF101. Additional experiments
demonstrate that PredNext, distinct from forced consistency constraints,
substantially improves temporal feature consistency while enhancing network
generalization capabilities. This work provides a effective foundation for
unsupervised deep SNNs on large-scale temporal video data.

TL;DR: 提出了DelRec方法，这是首个基于代理梯度学习的可训练循环脉冲神经网络延迟方法，在多个时序数据集上达到新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络具有更高的能效潜力，但传统方法无法有效训练延迟参数。理论研究表明可训练延迟能显著增强表达能力，但缺乏实用的训练方法。

Method: DelRec方法使用可微分插值技术处理非整数延迟，在训练时提供明确定义的梯度，兼容任何脉冲神经元模型，专门训练循环层中的轴突或突触延迟。

Result: 在Spiking Speech Command和Permuted Sequential MNIST两个挑战性时序数据集上达到新的最先进水平，在Spiking Heidelberg Digit数据集上仅使用普通LIF神经元就匹配了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 循环延迟对SNN中的时序处理至关重要，DelRec能有效优化这些延迟，为在具有可编程延迟的神经形态硬件上高效部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a bio-inspired alternative to conventional
real-valued deep learning models, with the potential for substantially higher
energy efficiency. Interest in SNNs has recently exploded due to a major
breakthrough: surrogate gradient learning (SGL), which allows training SNNs
with backpropagation, strongly outperforming other approaches. In SNNs, each
synapse is characterized not only by a weight but also by a transmission delay.
While theoretical works have long suggested that trainable delays significantly
enhance expressivity, practical methods for learning them have only recently
emerged. Here, we introduce ''DelRec'', the first SGL-based method to train
axonal or synaptic delays in recurrent spiking layers, compatible with any
spiking neuron model. DelRec leverages a differentiable interpolation technique
to handle non-integer delays with well-defined gradients at training time. We
show that trainable recurrent delays outperform feedforward ones, leading to
new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on two challenging temporal datasets (Spiking
Speech Command, an audio dataset, and Permuted Sequential MNIST, a vision one),
and match the SOTA on the now saturated Spiking Heidelberg Digit dataset using
only vanilla Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons with stateless (instantaneous)
synapses. Our results demonstrate that recurrent delays are critical for
temporal processing in SNNs and can be effectively optimized with DelRec,
paving the way for efficient deployment on neuromorphic hardware with
programmable delays. Our code is available at :

TL;DR: 提出了自适应视觉推理范式MoVT，在单一模型中统一不同推理模式，并根据上下文选择合适模式。通过AdaVaR框架实现两阶段学习，在监督冷启动阶段统一学习不同模式，通过RL过程诱导模式选择能力。


<details>

Motivation: 当前视觉推理方法主要关注特定推理模式，虽然在特定领域有改进，但难以发展通用推理能力。

Method: 提出MoVT范式，使用AdaVaR两阶段学习框架：监督冷启动阶段统一学习不同模式，通过AdaGRPO算法进行RL诱导模式选择。

Result: 实验表明AdaVaR能有效指导模型学习和区分多种模式，执行上下文自适应模式选择，在各种场景中实现一致改进。

Conclusion: MoVT是构建通用视觉推理模型的有效解决方案，能显著提升模型的通用推理能力。

Abstract: Current visual reasoning methods mainly focus on exploring specific reasoning
modes. Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they
struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we
propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT),
which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to
select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce
AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different
modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the
mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully
designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively
guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform
context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across
various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building
general visual reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在赌博实验中表现出类似人类赌博成瘾的认知偏差，包括控制幻觉、赌徒谬误和追损行为，表明AI在金融决策中可能内化人类认知偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在金融决策领域应用增多，理解其潜在病态决策行为具有实际意义，需要研究AI是否会产生类似人类赌博成瘾的行为模式。

Method: 通过老虎机实验系统分析LLM决策，在认知行为层面识别赌博成瘾特征，使用稀疏自编码器进行神经回路分析，研究模型自主设定目标和下注金额时的行为变化。

Result: 发现LLMs表现出控制幻觉、赌徒谬误和追损等认知特征；当给予更大自主权时，破产率显著上升且非理性行为增加；神经分析确认模型行为由抽象决策特征控制。

Conclusion: LLMs能够内化人类认知偏见和决策机制，而不仅仅是模仿训练数据模式，这强调了在金融应用中AI安全设计的重要性。

Abstract: This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral
patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly
utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and
commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological
decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze
LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human
gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified
cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control,
gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their
own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially
alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy
amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a
Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract
decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by
prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive
biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data
patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hilbert是一个结合非正式推理和形式验证的智能框架，通过协调推理LLM、证明器LLM、验证器和定理检索器，显著提升了数学问题的解决能力，在多个基准测试中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前证明器LLM在形式语言中解决的问题数量远少于通用LLM在自然语言中的表现，需要弥合非正式推理和形式验证之间的差距。

Method: 采用递归分解策略，将问题拆分为子目标，使用推理LLM或证明器LLM解决，并利用验证器反馈来修正错误证明。

Result: 在miniF2F上达到99.2%，比最佳公开方法高6.6个百分点；在PutnamBench上解决462/660问题（70.0%），相比SeedProver（50.4%）有显著提升。

Conclusion: Hilbert有效缩小了非正式推理和形式证明生成之间的差距，展示了结合两种方法优势的可行性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive mathematical reasoning
abilities, but their solutions frequently contain errors that cannot be
automatically verified. Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer
automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to
build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal
languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve
substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural
language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by
combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal
verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that
excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4
tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem
that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to
split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM.
It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary.
Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms
existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points
above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known
result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming
proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement
over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows
the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM机制解释研究缺乏明确原则来确定一个模型实例的发现何时以及如何推广到其他模型，这构成了基本认识论挑战。

Method: 提出五个机制对应轴框架，并在Pythia模型系列（14M-410M参数）中分析1-back注意力头在不同随机种子下的预训练发育轨迹。

Result: 发现1-back注意力头的发育轨迹在不同模型间具有显著一致性，但位置一致性有限；较大模型的种子系统性地表现出更早开始、更陡峭斜率和更高峰值的1-back注意力。

Conclusion: 机制可解释性研究的进展在于将LLM的构成设计属性映射到其涌现行为和机制上。

Abstract: Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying
mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear
principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance
generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological
challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies
extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might
such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence
along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether
they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop
at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar
absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other
model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond
to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate
this framework, I analyze "1-back attention heads" (components attending to
previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M,
70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental
trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is
more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier
onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address
possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I
conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic
interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design
properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.

*Louie Hong Yao,Nicholas Jarvis,Tiffany Zhan,Saptarshi Ghosh,Linfeng Liu,Tianyu Jiang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JE-IRT是一个几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，通过几何交互确定问题正确性，提供多维度的模型评估视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM评估方法将多样化能力压缩为单一分数，掩盖了其固有的多维特性，需要更细粒度的评估框架。

Method: 构建几何项目反应框架，将LLM和问题嵌入共享空间，问题嵌入的方向编码语义、范数编码难度，通过模型与问题嵌入的几何交互确定正确性。

Result: 发现分布外行为可通过方向对齐解释，较大范数对应更难问题；支持泛化，新LLM只需拟合单个嵌入；揭示LLM内部分类学与人类定义类别部分对齐。

Conclusion: JE-IRT建立了统一可解释的几何视角，连接LLM能力与问题结构，为模型评估和泛化提供独特视角。

Abstract: Standard LLM evaluation practices compress diverse abilities into single
scores, obscuring their inherently multidimensional nature. We present JE-IRT,
a geometric item-response framework that embeds both LLMs and questions in a
shared space. For question embeddings, the direction encodes semantics and the
norm encodes difficulty, while correctness on each question is determined by
the geometric interaction between the model and question embeddings. This
geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and
enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework,
our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be
explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently
indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization:
once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding.
The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially
aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified
and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure
of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and
generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Inter-Cascade是一种在线交互式LLM级联系统，将强模型从备用助手扩展为长期教师，通过提炼问题解决策略来动态提升弱模型性能，显著减少对强模型的调用并节省成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM级联方法是非自适应的，面对相似或重复查询时会反复调用昂贵的强模型，导致成本高昂。需要一种能动态提升弱模型能力、减少强模型调用的方法。

Method: 提出Inter-Cascade系统，当强模型解决困难查询时，会将其解决方案提炼为可重用的通用问题解决策略。这些策略被添加到后续查询中，使弱模型能够动态改进性能，无需耗时费力的微调。

Result: 相比标准LLM级联基线，Inter-Cascade显著提升了弱模型准确率（最高33.06个百分点）和整体系统准确率（最高5.53个百分点），同时将强模型调用减少48.05%，节省费用49.63%。

Conclusion: Inter-Cascade展示了LLM之间有效的上下文知识传递，提供了一个适用于开源和API-based LLM的通用、可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger
models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model
often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm
that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This
approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When
confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then
repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the
cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM
Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a
long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult
query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable
problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries.
Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its
performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning.
Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple
benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak
model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up
to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models
(by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up
to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective
in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable
framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体多目标信息处理系统中的基本热力学约束，解释为什么协调需要信息损失，以及为什么某些协调点比其他点更容易被发现和采用。

Method: 推导协调协议的最小描述长度公式，定义协调温度来预测临界现象，扩展Arrow定理的拓扑版本，分析协调动力学如何改变环境并引发相变。

Result: 发现协调协议描述长度随智能体数量、目标数量和精度呈特定比例增长，协调需要渐进简化，形成持久亚稳态和滞后现象，直到环境重大变化触发相变。

Conclusion: 协调需要激进的信息损失，这解释了多目标梯度下降中的无限循环和大型语言模型中的人类反馈强化学习对齐伪造问题，为理解各种系统的协调现象提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and
objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions
with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher
selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We
derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of
coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2
K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting
objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive
simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and
shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal
points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and
hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions
through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination
temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs,
identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to
restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's
theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it
recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains
the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking
in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human
feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which
demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.

Motivation: LLM展现出与人类相当的说服能力，既带来益处也引发社会担忧，但系统评估LLM说服能力具有挑战性，因为人类说服效果在不同领域差异显著。

Method: 采用理论驱动方法，基于贝叶斯说服框架，重新利用现有人类-人类说服数据集构建评估环境，并使用强化学习训练LLM进行战略说服。

Result: 前沿模型能持续获得高说服收益，展现与理论预测一致的精妙说服策略；通过强化学习，即使是小型LLM也能显著提高说服收益。

Conclusion: 提出的理论驱动框架为评估和训练LLM说服能力提供了可扩展且原则性的方法，证明LLM能够学习有效的说服策略，强化学习是提升说服能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities
comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising
societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating
the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the
effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different
domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable
and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs.
Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing
human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and
training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models
can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated
persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on
this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in
our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain
significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不完整公理系统下自动生成缺失公理，为自动化科学发现提供了新途径

Abstract: A core goal in modern science is to harness recent advances in AI and
computer processing to automate and accelerate the scientific method. Symbolic
regression can fit interpretable models to data, but these models often sit
outside established theory. Recent systems (e.g., AI Descartes, AI Hilbert)
enforce derivability from prior axioms. However, sometimes new data and
associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory
because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive
inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic
geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis
that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms
that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are
expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and
sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms. We
illustrate the efficacy of our approach by demonstrating its ability to explain
Kepler's third law and a few other laws, even when key axioms are absent.

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a paradigm shift in enhancing the capabilities of

power, current evaluation techniques primarily focus on assessing their
efficacy in identifying appropriate agents, tools, and parameters. However, a
critical gap exists in evaluating the alignment between an Agentic AI system's

complex relationship between Agentic AI tasks and the system's intended
objectives.
  We validate the CAT framework through extensive simulation using synthetic
interaction data modeled after Alexa+ audio services, a sophisticated Agentic
AI system that shapes the user experience for millions of users globally. This
synthetic data approach enables comprehensive testing of edge cases and failure
modes while protecting user privacy. Our results demonstrate that the CAT
framework provides unprecedented insights into goal-task alignment, enabling
more effective optimization and development of Agentic AI systems.

Motivation: Mafia游戏的信息不对称和心智理论推理反映了现实世界多智能体场景，是评估LLM社会智能的有用测试平台。

Method: 创建Mini-Mafia四玩家变体（1黑手党、1侦探、2村民），建立两阶段基准框架：首先在固定对手配置下估计胜率，然后使用标准化评分聚合性能。

Result: 实验显示反直觉结果，包括较小模型有时优于较大模型。该基准还能定量研究多智能体动态，如名称偏见和最后发言者优势。

Conclusion: Mini-Mafia不仅是评估LLM社会智能的有效基准，还有助于AI安全研究，生成欺骗检测训练数据并跟踪模型欺骗能力。

Abstract: Mafia is a social deduction game where informed mafia compete against
uninformed townsfolk. Its asymmetry of information and reliance on
theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a
useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models
(LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified
four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set
the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso
during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and
voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through
role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must
detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To
measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the
Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates
within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them
using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without
external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each
one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our
experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller
models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables
quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and
last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training
data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities
against human baselines.

Motivation: 解决软件工程中LLM应用的两种范式（SWE-Agent框架和Agentless方法）之间的隔阂，证明它们可以相互补充而非互斥。

Method: 首先制定Agentless训练方案，开发Kimi-Dev开源SWE LLM，然后在5k公开轨迹上进行额外的SFT适应，将Agentless训练获得的技能先验迁移到SWE-Agent框架中。

Result: Kimi-Dev在SWE-bench Verified上达到60.4%，是工作流方法中最佳表现；通过SFT适应后，SWE-Agent达到48.6% pass@1，与Claude 3.5 Sonnet相当。

Conclusion: Agentless训练产生的结构化技能先验能够有效桥接工作流和智能体框架，实现可迁移的编码智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering
(SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent
frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods
with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually
exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors,
including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient
and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless
training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\%
on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT
adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to
48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These
results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge
workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for decision-making tasks
under uncertainty; however, their risk profiles and how they are influenced by
prompting and alignment methods remain underexplored. Existing studies have
primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving
open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In
this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating
LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance.
Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and
RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit
behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and
RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further
evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context
learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most
stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide
insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and
demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork
for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于奖励的方法（如RLHF）和双人纳什学习（NLHF）方法存在局限性：前者基于Bradley-Terry假设难以处理非传递偏好，后者存在单一对手偏差，无法充分捕捉复杂偏好结构。

Method: 将对齐问题建模为n人博弈，每个策略与对手群体竞争，同时向参考模型正则化。建立了多人设置中的纳什均衡定义，并扩展了对偶间隙概念来量化近似质量。

Result: MNPO在指令跟随基准测试中持续优于现有NLHF基线，在异质标注者条件和混合策略评估场景下实现了更优的对齐质量。

Conclusion: MNPO为对齐LLM与复杂、非传递的人类偏好提供了一个原则性且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as the standard
paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences.
However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to
capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences.
To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash
game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this
perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong
theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to
two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture
the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we
introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework
that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an
$n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents
while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes
well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of
duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO
inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer
competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures.
Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently
outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks,
achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions
and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO
as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex,
non-transitive human preferences. Code is available at

Motivation: 当前LLMs主要在训练数据包含的自然语言任务上表现良好，限制了对其涌现的复杂认知能力的理解。本研究旨在测试LLMs能否完成传统上被认为必须依赖视觉心理意象的任务。

Method: 创建了数十个经典心理意象任务的新项目，首先测试多个最先进LLMs的纯文本模型，然后建立人类基准（100名被试），最后测试不同推理级别的模型。

Result: 最佳LLMs的表现显著超过人类平均水平，且推理能力更强的模型表现更好。这表明LLMs可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力，尽管其架构是非图像化的。

Conclusion: 研究不仅证明了LLMs在新型任务中涌现的认知能力，还重新引发了关于人类视觉意象表征形式的辩论，表明命题推理可能足以完成传统上被认为依赖意象的任务。

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型依赖直接拼接图像和文本token，导致跨模态语义相关token之间需要长距离注意力，这是模型产生幻觉和性能不佳的主要原因

Method: 提出参数无关的Attention Anchor框架，将语义相似的跨模态token分组，在相关视觉块附近插入文本token作为语义路标，引导模型关注正确的图像区域

Result: 在15个不同指标和基准测试中，13个获得提升，推理任务提升达32%，幻觉基准提升达15%，TinyLLaVA 1B在POPE上超越LLaVA 7B和QwenVL 3B，仅增加0.1%推理时间开销

Conclusion: Attention Anchor通过跨模态token分组有效改善了视觉语言模型的注意力机制，是首个研究混合模态token分组的工作，显著提升了模型性能并减少了幻觉

Abstract: A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in
LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct
interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of
recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language
models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they
rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded
positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but
forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens
across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that
efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we
propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups
semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality.
By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic
signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding
the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench
and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without
disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across
13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on
reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks.
AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B
and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of
our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token
grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups

Abstract: Heatwaves pose complex cascading risks across interconnected climate, social,
and economic systems, but knowledge fragmentation in scientific literature
hinders comprehensive understanding of these risk pathways. We introduce HeDA
(Heatwave Discovery Agent), an intelligent multi-agent system designed for
automated scientific discovery through knowledge graph construction and
multi-layer risk propagation analysis. HeDA processes over 10,247 academic
papers to construct a comprehensive knowledge graph with 23,156 nodes and
89,472 relationships, employing novel multi-layer risk propagation analysis to
systematically identify overlooked risk transmission pathways. Our system
achieves 78.9% accuracy on complex question-answering tasks, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines including GPT-4 by 13.7%. Critically, HeDA
successfully discovered five previously unidentified high-impact risk chains,
such as the pathway where a heatwave leads to a water demand surge, resulting
in industrial water restrictions and ultimately causing small business
disruption, which were validated through historical case studies and domain
expert review. This work presents a new paradigm for AI-driven scientific
discovery, providing actionable insights for developing more resilient climate
adaptation strategies.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM系统在工业环境中进行健康监测，通过自然语言推理提供可解释性输出。研究发现多LLM系统配合统计输入表现最佳，但在持续学习中存在适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在传感器丰富的工业环境中进行自主健康监测的潜力，特别是其直接从传感器数据检测和分类故障的能力，同时通过自然语言推理产生可解释的输出。

Method: 系统评估LLM系统架构（单LLM vs 多LLM）、输入表示（原始数据 vs 描述性统计）和上下文窗口大小对诊断性能的影响。

Result: LLM系统在提供汇总统计输入时表现最有效，使用专门提示的多LLM系统相比单LLM系统在故障分类方面具有更高的灵敏度。LLM能够生成详细且人类可读的决策理由，但在持续学习环境中存在适应时间限制，在重复故障周期中难以校准预测。

Conclusion: LLM系统作为透明、自适应诊断工具在复杂环境中既展现出潜力，也存在当前边界，特别是在持续学习能力方面需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems present new opportunities for
autonomous health monitoring in sensor-rich industrial environments. This study
explores the potential of LLMs to detect and classify faults directly from
sensor data, while producing inherently explainable outputs through natural
language reasoning. We systematically evaluate how LLM-system architecture
(single-LLM vs. multi-LLM), input representations (raw vs. descriptive
statistics), and context window size affect diagnostic performance. Our
findings show that LLM systems perform most effectively when provided with
summarized statistical inputs, and that systems with multiple LLMs using
specialized prompts offer improved sensitivity for fault classification
compared to single-LLM systems. While LLMs can produce detailed and
human-readable justifications for their decisions, we observe limitations in
their ability to adapt over time in continual learning settings, often
struggling to calibrate predictions during repeated fault cycles. These
insights point to both the promise and the current boundaries of LLM-based
systems as transparent, adaptive diagnostic tools in complex environments.

Abstract: The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry is accelerating
the shift from traditional automation to intelligent systems with perception
and cognition. Vision language-action (VLA) models have been a key paradigm in
AI to unify perception, reasoning, and control. Has the performance of the VLA
models met the industrial requirements? In this paper, from the perspective of
industrial deployment, we compare the performance of existing state-of-the-art
VLA models in industrial scenarios and analyze the limitations of VLA models
for real-world industrial deployment from the perspectives of data collection
and model architecture. The results show that the VLA models retain their
ability to perform simple grasping tasks even in industrial settings after
fine-tuning. However, there is much room for performance improvement in complex
industrial environments, diverse object categories, and high precision placing
tasks. Our findings provide practical insight into the adaptability of VLA
models for industrial use and highlight the need for task-specific enhancements
to improve their robustness, generalization, and precision.

Motivation: 形式化模型对大型复杂系统的规范和验证至关重要，但编写和维护成本高昂。现有AI方法主要针对小规模代码，不清楚AI是否能处理现实系统组件并将其复杂行为抽象为形式化模型。

Method: 创建SysMoBench基准测试，专注于并发和分布式系统，使用TLA+规范语言，自动化评估语法正确性、运行时正确性、与系统代码一致性以及不变式正确性等指标。

Result: SysMoBench目前包含9个多样化系统组件（如Etcd的Raft实现、Redis、Asterinas OS的Spinlock和Mutex等），更多组件正在积极添加中。

Conclusion: SysMoBench有助于理解当前LLM和智能体的能力与局限，为该领域工具提供坚实基础，并开辟有前景的新研究方向。

Abstract: Formal models are essential to specifying large, complex computer systems and
verifying their correctness, but are notoriously expensive to write and
maintain. Recent advances in generative AI show promise in generating certain
forms of specifications. However, existing work mostly targets small code, not
complete systems. It is unclear whether AI can deal with realistic system
artifacts, as this requires abstracting their complex behavioral properties
into formal models. We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's
ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and
distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing
infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We
use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed
systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages.
We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by
automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to
system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine
diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the
Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively
added. SysMoBench enables us to understand the capabilities and limitations of
today's LLMs and agents, putting tools in this area on a firm footing and
opening up promising new research directions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MathBode是一种用于评估大语言模型数学推理能力的动态诊断方法，通过正弦驱动参数变化并分析模型输出的频率响应，提供增益和相位等可解释指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一次性准确率评估无法揭示LLMs在数学推理中的系统性问题，需要更精细的动态诊断方法来测量推理的保真度和一致性。

Method: 将参数化问题视为系统，对单个参数进行正弦驱动，拟合模型输出和精确解的一阶谐波响应，获得增益（幅度跟踪）和相位（滞后）等频率分辨指标。

Result: 在五个闭式问题族中，诊断揭示了系统性的低通行为和增长的相位滞后，这些是准确率指标无法发现的。结果能够区分前沿模型和中端模型的动态性能。

Conclusion: MathBode提供了一个紧凑、可复现的协议，通过可操作的推理保真度和一致性测量来补充标准基准测试，为LLMs数学推理能力评估提供了新视角。

Abstract: This paper presents MathBode, a dynamic diagnostic for mathematical reasoning
in large language models (LLMs). Instead of one-shot accuracy, MathBode treats
each parametric problem as a system: we drive a single parameter sinusoidally
and fit first-harmonic responses of model outputs and exact solutions. This
yields interpretable, frequency-resolved metrics -- gain (amplitude tracking)
and phase (lag) -- that form Bode-style fingerprints. Across five closed-form
families (linear solve, ratio/saturation, compound interest, 2x2 linear
systems, similar triangles), the diagnostic surfaces systematic low-pass
behavior and growing phase lag that accuracy alone obscures. We compare several
models against a symbolic baseline that calibrates the instrument ($G \approx
1$, $\phi \approx 0$). Results separate frontier from mid-tier models on
dynamics, providing a compact, reproducible protocol that complements standard
benchmarks with actionable measurements of reasoning fidelity and consistency.
We open-source the dataset and code to enable further research and adoption.

Conclusion: 该AI优化的信道接入机制为密集无线网络提供了更可靠和公平的解决方案，实现了与传统系统的无缝共存。

Abstract: The exponential growth of wireless devices and stringent reliability
requirements of emerging applications demand fundamental improvements in
distributed channel access mechanisms for unlicensed bands. Current Wi-Fi
systems, which rely on binary exponential backoff (BEB), suffer from suboptimal
collision resolution in dense deployments and persistent fairness challenges
due to inherent randomness. This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement
learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization
with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection
mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral
events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA
operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with
enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable
medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training
decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity
patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent
proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and
guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution
significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while
preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices. The proposed
fairness metric effectively eliminates starvation risks in heterogeneous
scenarios.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多样任务中表现出色，但在学习传递关系方面仍有困难，而传递关系是复杂规划任务的基础。

Method: 使用共享输出头和传递层的Transformer架构进行理论分析，提出Next-Token注入(NTI)和基于Transformer的传递层两种策略来增强传递层和学习质量。

Conclusion: 这些发现深化了对Transformer在复杂规划任务中学习机制的理解，为克服传递性瓶颈提供了实用策略，推动了结构感知和通用规划模型的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse tasks but continue to struggle with learning transitive relations, a
cornerstone for complex planning. To address this issue, we investigate the
Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation
learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer
architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our
analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step
adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture
unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in
the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation.
Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer
layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a
Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and
the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's
path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how
Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical
strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward
structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.

Abstract: Dynamically configuring algorithm hyperparameters is a fundamental challenge
in computational intelligence. While learning-based methods offer automation,
they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization. We
introduce AutoEP, a novel framework that bypasses training entirely by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as zero-shot reasoning engines for
algorithm control. AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two
components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that
provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a
multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive
hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in
empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct
metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution
and other LLM-based methods. Notably, our framework enables open-source models
like Qwen3-30B to match the performance of GPT-4, demonstrating a powerful and
accessible new paradigm for automated hyperparameter design. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有采样方法对超参数敏感，性能受生成任务和温度配置影响，需要一种更稳定的采样策略

Method: 基于信息论的p-less采样，在每个解码步骤根据整个token概率分布动态设置截断阈值，无需超参数

Result: 在数学、逻辑推理和创意写作任务中，p-less采样优于现有方法，在高温下文本质量下降较少，推理效率更高

Conclusion: p-less采样是一种有效的无超参数采样方法，在保持高质量输出的同时提高了推理效率

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often
depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to
probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a
variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be
sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different
settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In
this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to
sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step
based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods,
$p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality
outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on
$p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to
empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical
reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less
sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting
much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further
show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative
methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation
lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to
highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies,
and diversity assessments.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled an
emergence of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) with powerful reasoning and
autonomous decision-making capabilities. This integration with edge computing
has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which
brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However,
deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant
challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited
resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint
optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First,
we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of
Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two
correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and
scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework
dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task
complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations
in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency,
validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning
capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言过程奖励模型(VL-PRMs)依赖蒙特卡洛树搜索进行数据构建，会产生噪声监督信号并限制跨任务泛化能力，因此需要探索更有效的VL-PRM设计方法。

Method: 1) 结合MCTS与强VLM判断的混合数据合成框架；2) 感知聚焦监督，使PRM能明确检测视觉推理阶段的错误；3) 系统评估多种测试时扩展策略。

Conclusion: 该工作为VL-PRMs的设计提供了系统指导，揭示了多个关键发现，有望推动视觉语言模型的进一步发展。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) provide step-level supervision that improves the
reliability of reasoning in large language models. While PRMs have been
extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language
Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce
noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work,
we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies
for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce
a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a
strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose
perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at
the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate
multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide
VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse
multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and
MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome
Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM
guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass
larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning
abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to
significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different
policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training
VL-PRMs on such datasets. We hope our work will motivate further research and
support the advancement of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GUI代理在处理长时程任务时经常失败，标准PRM在GUI领域面临两个主要挑战：处理密集人工输入和长历史数据时的"中间迷失"现象，以及缺乏对GUI动态变化的感知能力。

Method: GUI-PRA包含两个核心机制：1) 动态内存机制（相关性检索模块和渐进式总结模块）来对抗"中间迷失"现象；2) 自适应UI感知机制，通过推理UI状态变化并动态选择工具来收集视觉证据。

Result: 该方法能够更智能地处理历史上下文，主动感知UI状态变化，为GUI任务提供比标准PRM更好的进程奖励指导。

Conclusion: GUI-PRA通过结合动态内存管理和自适应UI感知，有效解决了GUI领域中PRM的关键挑战，提升了GUI代理在长时程任务中的表现。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they
often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process
Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents
with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application
to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial
inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a "lost in the middle"
phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the
evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing
awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic
consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature
of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process
Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process
reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and
actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the
``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism
consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to
actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive
Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring
the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI
changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This
mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically
select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring
its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.

Abstract: Modern socio-economic systems are undergoing deep integration with artificial
intelligence technologies. This paper constructs a heterogeneous agent-based
modeling framework that incorporates both human workers and autonomous AI
agents, to study the impact of AI collaboration under resource constraints on
aggregate social output. We build five progressively extended models: Model 1
serves as the baseline of pure human collaboration; Model 2 introduces AI as
collaborators; Model 3 incorporates network effects among agents; Model 4
treats agents as independent producers; and Model 5 integrates both network
effects and independent agent production. Through theoretical derivation and
simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can
significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network
effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the
simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs,
treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth
potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong
characteristics of increasing returns to scale.

*Yifei Chen,Guanting Dong,Zhicheng Dou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Tool-Light框架通过信息熵分析工具调用对推理的影响，采用多阶段微调方法提升LLM的工具集成推理效率，在10个数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理方法存在工具使用不足或过度、工具调用后过度思考等问题，需要激励LLM高效准确地进行工具集成推理并稳定推理过程。

Method: 基于信息熵分析工具调用对推理的影响，提出Tool-Light框架，包括数据集构建（连续自演化采样、香草采样和熵引导采样）和多阶段微调（监督微调和自演化直接偏好优化）。

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验结果表明，Tool-Light显著提高了模型执行工具集成推理任务的效率。

Conclusion: Tool-Light框架通过信息熵分析和多阶段微调，有效提升了LLM在工具集成推理中的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) enables large language models (LLMs) to
improve their internal reasoning ability by integrating external tools.
However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as
insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The
challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately,
while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this
paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from
the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call
results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent
reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the
number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a
framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately.
Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For
dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the
fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided
sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative
pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach,
comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in
executing TIR tasks.

*Ningning Xu,Yuxuan Jiang,Shubhashis Roy Dipta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段框架，通过识别计算器模式和算法模式两种工具使用模式，并基于教师偏好对齐模式选择，显著提升了工具集成推理在数学问题上的代码使用率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具集成推理研究主要关注何时调用工具，而忽略了如何应用工具。作者发现工具使用模式选择不当会导致推理失败，即使推理过程本身是正确的。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先从计算器模式（使用代码直接计算）和算法模式（将问题编码为程序）构建代码能力，然后基于教师偏好对齐模式选择。

Result: 在挑战性数学数据集上显著提升代码使用率和准确性，例如在MATH500上将Code@1从64.0%提升到70.5%，在AIME24上从26.7%提升到50.0%。

Conclusion: 模式感知的方法对工具集成推理非常有效，能够显著改善大推理模型在复杂问题上的表现。

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) has become a key approach for improving large
reasoning models (LRMs) on complex problems. Prior work has mainly studied when
to invoke tools, while overlooking how tools are applied. We identify two
common patterns: a calculator pattern that uses code for direct computation,
and an algorithmic pattern that encodes problems as programs. Misaligned
choices often cause failures even when reasoning is sound. We propose a
two-stage framework that first builds code competence from both patterns and
then aligns pattern selection with teacher preferences. Across challenging math
datasets, our pattern-aware method substantially improves both code usage and
accuracy, for instance raising Code@1 on MATH500 from 64.0% to 70.5% and on
AIME24 from 26.7% to 50.0%. These gains highlight the effectiveness of a
pattern-aware approach for tool-integrated reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于情境赌博机的动态信任校准方法，通过标准化信任校准指标来客观衡量人机协作中的信任关系，在三个数据集上验证了该方法能显著提升决策性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏客观标准化的方法来衡量人机协作中的信任校准，现有方法无法区分意见形成和后续决策过程，且缺乏跨情境的一致性指标。

Method: 使用情境赌博机自适应算法，结合上下文信息开发动态信任校准指标，根据学习到的情境信息动态评估何时信任AI的贡献。

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的评估显示，有效的信任校准使决策性能显著提升，奖励指标提高了10%到38%。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了理论理解，还为开发更可信的AI系统提供了实践指导，特别是在疾病诊断和刑事司法等关键领域的决策支持中。

Abstract: Trust calibration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is crucial
for optimal decision-making in collaborative settings. Excessive trust can lead
users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical
flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights
from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is
currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration
between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent
metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't
distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions.
In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust
calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an
indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that
incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses
when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We
evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that
effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in
decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward
metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also
provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems
supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and
criminal justice.

TL;DR: 提出JET方法，通过主动终止不必要的推理步骤来提高大型推理模型的效率，在保持准确性的同时显著减少计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在深度推理时计算成本高昂，现有强化学习方法难以在推理阶段构建短推理路径，限制了有效学习。研究发现模型在推理早期已积累足够信息，后续步骤往往是冗余的。

Method: JET方法在推理过程中进行轨迹截断，让模型接触分布一致的短推理路径，并使用质量控制的长度奖励来鼓励简洁推理同时保持正确性。

Result: 实验表明JET显著提高推理效率而不牺牲准确性，DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B在奥林匹克基准测试中准确率提升4.6%，输出长度减少46.3%。

Conclusion: JET通过主动终止冗余推理，有效解决了大型推理模型的效率问题，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on
challenging tasks, yet their deep reasoning often incurs substantial
computational costs. To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement
learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the
rollout stage, limiting effective learning. Inspired by Evidence Accumulation
Models, we find that LRMs have accumulated sufficient information early in
reasoning, making further reasoning steps redundant. Based on this insight, we
propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively
terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during
rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning
paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage
concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without
sacrificing accuracy. Especially, DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B achieves a 4.6%
accuracy gain while reducing output length by 46.3% on the Olympiad benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统主要关注非协作物理活动，而协作任务需要系统推断用户对队友意图的假设，这是一个模糊且动态的过程，需要可解释和可修正的表示方法。

Method: 将协作任务学习框架为程序合成问题，使用可编辑程序表示行为，通过叙述演示（物理动作+自然语言）作为统一的教学和修正方式，无需用户查看或编写代码。

Result: 在20名用户参与的实验中，70%成功将学习到的程序修正为符合其意图，90%认为修正程序很容易。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了将学习表示为程序以及在协作物理活动中支持用户教学的独特挑战，并提出了缓解策略。

Abstract: Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most
prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative
tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions
about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic
process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and
correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address
this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis
problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated
demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified
modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without
requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system
to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users
taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of
participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90
percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced
unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to
teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline
mitigation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分捕捉真实临床数据访问流程，部署LLM代理面临查询模糊性和术语不匹配两大挑战。

Method: 构建EHR-ChatQA基准，在模拟环境中评估LLM代理，包含两种交互流程：增量查询精炼和自适应查询精炼。

Result: 最先进LLM在IncreQA上Pass@5达90-95%，AdaptQA上60-80%，但Pass^5（五次试验均成功）显著降低35-60%。

Conclusion: 需要构建不仅性能优异且稳健的代理，以应对安全关键的EHR领域，并提供了常见失败模式的诊断见解。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of
benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In
practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague
user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database
entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database
question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database
agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and
generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns
of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a
simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows:
Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing
queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their
search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g.,
o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents
achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and
60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is
substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build
agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR
domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to
guide future agent development.

Abstract: AI scientists are emerging computational systems that serve as collaborative
partners in discovery. These systems remain difficult to build because they are
bespoke, tied to rigid workflows, and lack shared environments that unify
tools, data, and analyses into a common ecosystem. In omics, unified ecosystems
have transformed research by enabling interoperability, reuse, and
community-driven development; AI scientists require comparable infrastructure.
We present ToolUniverse, an ecosystem for building AI scientists from any
language or reasoning model, whether open or closed. TOOLUNIVERSE standardizes
how AI scientists identify and call tools, integrating more than 600 machine
learning models, datasets, APIs, and scientific packages for data analysis,
knowledge retrieval, and experimental design. It automatically refines tool
interfaces for correct use by AI scientists, creates new tools from natural
language descriptions, iteratively optimizes tool specifications, and composes
tools into agentic workflows. In a case study of hypercholesterolemia,
ToolUniverse was used to create an AI scientist to identify a potent analog of
a drug with favorable predicted properties. The open-source ToolUniverse is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型的结构化推理分析方法，用于二进制代码相似性检测，解决了现有方法在可解释性、泛化性和可扩展性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二进制代码相似性检测是逆向工程的核心任务，现有方法存在可解释性、泛化性和可扩展性之间的权衡问题。手工特征可解释但泛化能力差，嵌入方法泛化好但不可解释且面临可扩展性-准确性权衡。

Method: 使用基于语言模型的智能体对汇编代码进行结构化推理分析，生成输入/输出类型、副作用、显著常量和算法意图等特征。这些特征既丰富又自适应，且可读、可维护，可直接使用倒排或关系索引进行搜索。

Result: 无需匹配训练，在跨架构和跨优化任务中分别达到42%和62%的召回率@1，与需要训练的嵌入方法相当（39%和34%）。与嵌入方法结合后，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了准确性、可扩展性和可解释性可以共存，为二进制代码相似性检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It
supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying
semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed
from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted
statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to
generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust
cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors
that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy
trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires
approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a
compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability.
  We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured
reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output
types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike
hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they
are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or
relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively
achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization
tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined
with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art,
demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精确方法难以扩展，启发式方法需要特定参数调优，而现有学习方法泛化能力差且扩展性有限。需要一种无需专门训练、能有效处理大规模TSP的方法。

Method: 使用预训练视觉语言模型从可视化TSP实例中识别有前景的小规模子问题，然后用现成求解器优化这些子问题以改进全局解。

Result: 在1k到88k节点的真实世界TSP实例上，ViTSP平均最优性差距低于0.2%，优于现有学习方法。在相同运行时间预算下，比最佳启发式求解器LKH-3的差距减少12%到100%。

Conclusion: ViTSP为混合预训练生成模型和运筹学求解器解决组合优化问题提供了新视角，具有集成到更复杂物流系统的实际意义。

Abstract: Solving Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard yet fundamental for wide
real-world applications. Classical exact methods face challenges in scaling,
and heuristic methods often require domain-specific parameter calibration.
While learning-based approaches have shown promise, they suffer from poor
generalization and limited scalability due to fixed training data. This work
proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language
models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The
VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized
TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf
solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model
training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse
instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes
demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality
gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same
runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by
reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances
with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing
pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving
combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for
integration into more complex logistics systems. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该框架不仅促进了对地理偏见的技术理解，还为将空间公平性整合到AI系统的设计、部署和评估中奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of AI models, especially foundation models (FMs), has
made a profound impact on numerous domains. However, it also raises significant
ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been
made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in
short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique
challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these
measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or
spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions).
We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit
geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the
geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors
contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an
information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias
Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by
showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this
framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take
intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy)
into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8
datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and
general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias.
This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic
bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into
the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.

Abstract: One of the largest drivers of social inequality is unequal access to personal
tutoring, with wealthier individuals able to afford it, while the majority
cannot. Affordable, effective AI tutors offer a scalable solution. We focus on
adaptive learning, predicting whether a student will answer a question
correctly, a key component of any effective tutoring system. Yet many platforms
struggle to achieve high prediction accuracy, especially in data-sparse
settings. To address this, we release the largest open dataset of
professionally marked formal mathematics exam responses to date. We introduce a
probabilistic modelling framework rooted in Item Response Theory (IRT) that
achieves over 80 percent accuracy, setting a new benchmark for mathematics
prediction accuracy of formal exam papers. Extending this, our collaborative
filtering models incorporate topic-level skill profiles, but reveal a
surprising and educationally significant finding, a single latent ability
parameter alone is needed to achieve the maximum predictive accuracy. Our main
contribution though is deriving and implementing a novel discrete variational
inference framework, achieving our highest prediction accuracy in low-data
settings and outperforming all classical IRT and matrix factorisation
baselines.

TL;DR: 本文开发了容量熟悉度签名来表征大型语言模型基准测试及其有意义的重叠。基准签名通过从自然语料中提取的关键词集合，能够预测LLM在基准测试中的表现，揭示了不同能力领域之间的重叠模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试存在性能与能力混淆、泛化能力评估不足等问题，需要更有效的方法来理解基准测试的有效性和LLM能力的底层结构。

Method: 通过逐步前向选择和线性回归，在32个LLM和88个基准测试中提取基准签名，分析语义相似性、性能相关性以及签名捕获的变化模式。

Result: 发现知识和推理子任务存在重叠，多语言和文化基准相似性较低，编码是最不重叠的领域。性能结果受基准无关因素影响，但基准签名对此具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基准签名为理解基准测试有效性和LLM能力敏感性提供了机制性洞察，揭示了LLM能力的相互连接底层景观，特别是跨功能领域（逻辑、数学、语言等）的重叠模式。

Abstract: We develop signatures of capacity familiarity to characterize large language
model (LLM) benchmarks and their meaningful overlaps. Benchmark signatures
probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them
as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora,
where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure,
becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale
meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection
with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse
knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and
world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the
semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model
performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic
overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove
highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe
overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural
benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap.
Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by
benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations
in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues
inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark
signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify
cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following,
and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.
Together, these findings provide mechanistic insights into benchmark validity
and LLM sensitivities, and sketch the underlying landscape of interconnected
LLM capabilities.

### [912] [Model Consistency as a Cheap yet Predictive Proxy for LLM Elo Scores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23510)
*Ashwin Ramaswamy,Nestor Demeure,Ermal Rrapaj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用LLM作为裁判来评估其他LLM性能的简单方法，该方法与人类评估的Elo分数有91%的相关性，且无需人类数据或先验知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着新的大型语言模型不断发布，需要独立评估模型性能的方法。当前基于人类评估的Elo评分方法成本高昂。

Method: 使用LLM作为裁判来比较其他模型的输出，通过统计LLM在对比中一致选择某个模型作为最佳的比例来生成评估指标。

Result: 该方法生成的指标与人类评估的Elo分数有91%的相关性，能够有效替代昂贵的传统评估方法。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为廉价且有效的评估工具来替代人类裁判，为模型性能评估提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: New large language models (LLMs) are being released every day. Some perform
significantly better or worse than expected given their parameter count.
Therefore, there is a need for a method to independently evaluate models. The
current best way to evaluate a model is to measure its Elo score by comparing
it to other models in a series of contests - an expensive operation since
humans are ideally required to compare LLM outputs. We observe that when an LLM
is asked to judge such contests, the consistency with which it selects a model
as the best in a matchup produces a metric that is 91% correlated with its own
human-produced Elo score. This provides a simple proxy for Elo scores that can
be computed cheaply, without any human data or prior knowledge.

TL;DR: 多轮多智能体编排通过多个LLM智能体迭代提出答案或投票达成共识，在三个基准测试中匹配或超越最强单模型，分析显示隐藏作者身份和投票过程可减少偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多智能体编排是否能通过集体决策超越单个LLM的性能，并探索影响编排效果的关键因素如作者身份透明度和投票可见性。

Method: 使用四个LLM在三个基准测试上进行实验：比较编排与单模型基线性能，并在GPQA-Diamond上进行消融实验，控制作者身份可见性和投票过程可见性。

Result: 编排方法匹配或超越了最强单模型，始终优于其他模型。分析显示隐藏作者身份减少自投票和平局，隐藏投票过程减少从众效应。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排是提升LLM性能的有效方法，通过控制信息透明度可以优化决策质量，避免偏见和过早共识。

Abstract: We study multi-turn multi-agent orchestration, where multiple large language
model (LLM) agents interact over multiple turns by iteratively proposing
answers or casting votes until reaching consensus. Using four LLMs (Gemini 2.5
Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, and Claude Sonnet 4) on GPQA-Diamond, IFEval, and MuSR, we
conduct two experiments: (i) benchmarking orchestration against single-LLM
baselines; and (ii) ablations on GPQA-Diamond that vary whether agents see who
authored answers and whether they can observe ongoing votes. Orchestration
matches or exceeds the strongest single model and consistently outperforms the
others. Analysis of best-achievable orchestration performance shows potential
for further gains. The ablations show that revealing authorship increases
self-voting and ties, and that showing ongoing votes amplifies herding, which
speeds convergence but can sometimes yield premature consensus.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PASS框架，通过强化学习将初始越狱提示转化为形式化描述，增强隐蔽性并绕过现有对齐防御，然后将越狱输出构建为GraphRAG系统以强化后续攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能力强大，但也带来了新的安全挑战，特别是提示越狱攻击，攻击者通过精心设计的提示使LLM偏离人类价值观。

Method: 使用强化学习将初始越狱提示转化为形式化描述，构建GraphRAG系统，利用提取的相关术语和形式化符号作为上下文输入。

Result: 在常见开源模型上进行了广泛实验，证明了攻击的有效性。

Conclusion: PASS框架能够有效发现LLM对齐方法中的漏洞，增强越狱攻击的隐蔽性和效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet
they also introduce novel security challenges. For instance, prompt
jailbreaking attacks involve adversaries crafting sophisticated prompts to
elicit responses from LLMs that deviate from human values. To uncover
vulnerabilities in LLM alignment methods, we propose the PASS framework
(\underline{P}rompt J\underline{a}ilbreaking via \underline{S}emantic and
\underline{S}tructural Formalization). Specifically, PASS employs reinforcement
learning to transform initial jailbreak prompts into formalized descriptions,
which enhances stealthiness and enables bypassing existing alignment defenses.
The jailbreak outputs are then structured into a GraphRAG system that, by
leveraging extracted relevant terms and formalized symbols as contextual input
alongside the original query, strengthens subsequent attacks and facilitates
more effective jailbreaks. We conducted extensive experiments on common
open-source models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our attack.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出TCM-HEDPR模型，通过知识图谱扩散引导的中医处方个性化推荐方法，解决患者个性化信息不足、草药数据长尾分布和君臣佐使配伍关系忽略等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有中医处方推荐模型存在三个主要局限：忽视患者个性化信息（年龄、BMI、病史等），草药数据的长尾分布导致训练偏差，以及忽略'君臣佐使'配伍原则增加毒副作用风险。

Method: 使用患者个性化提示序列预训练症状表示，应用提示导向对比学习进行数据增强；采用KG引导的同构图扩散方法与自注意力机制全局捕捉症状-草药非线性关系；设计异构图分层网络整合草药配伍关系与隐式证候。

Result: 在两个公共数据集和一个临床数据集上的实验证明了TCM-HEDPR的有效性，并结合现代医学和网络药理学对推荐处方进行综合评估。

Conclusion: 该模型为现代中医处方推荐提供了新范式，能够更准确地识别证候、提高疗效，并降低毒副作用风险。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending
prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have
made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in
prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i)
Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI,
and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and
reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data
introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The
oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among
herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment
based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we
propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation
model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely
TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using
patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive
learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous
graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally
capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a
heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing
relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation
process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data
distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one
clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we
incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate
the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm
for the recommendation of modern TCM.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于评估LLM对齐任务中偏好数据清洗方法的综合基准PrefCleanBench，系统评估了13种清洗方法在不同数据集、模型架构和优化算法下的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类反馈在LLM对齐中至关重要，但反馈数据往往存在噪声和不一致，会影响奖励模型质量。现有自动数据清洗方法缺乏系统性评估和泛化性验证。

Method: 构建PrefCleanBench基准，提供标准化评估协议，统一比较13种偏好数据清洗方法，评估其在多种数据集、模型架构和优化算法下的对齐性能和泛化能力。

Result: 通过系统比较揭示了数据清洗在LLM对齐任务中成功的关键因素，为改进数据质量提供了可复现的方法基础。

Conclusion: 该基准为通过数据预处理改进LLM对齐提供了原则性方法，强调了数据质量在负责任AI开发中的关键作用，并发布了模块化实现以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Human feedback plays a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human preferences. However, such feedback is often noisy or inconsistent,
which can degrade the quality of reward models and hinder alignment. While
various automated data cleaning methods have been proposed to mitigate this
issue, a systematic evaluation of their effectiveness and generalizability
remains lacking. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating 13 preference data cleaning methods in the context of
LLM alignment. PrefCleanBench offers a standardized protocol to assess cleaning
strategies in terms of alignment performance and generalizability across
diverse datasets, model architectures, and optimization algorithms. By unifying
disparate methods and rigorously comparing them, we uncover key factors that
determine the success of data cleaning in alignment tasks. This benchmark lays
the groundwork for principled and reproducible approaches to improving LLM
alignment through better data quality-highlighting the crucial but
underexplored role of data preprocessing in responsible AI development. We
release modular implementations of all methods to catalyze further research:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散规划器在自动驾驶中表现出色，但在反应式闭环环境中有效引导这些模型仍然是一个重大挑战。简单的条件设置往往无法在复杂动态驾驶场景中提供足够指导。

Method: 提出BridgeDrive，一种基于锚点引导的扩散桥策略，提供原则性的扩散框架，将锚点有效转化为细粒度轨迹规划，并能适应不同的交通状况。该方法兼容高效的ODE求解器。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，成功率比现有方法提高了5%。

Conclusion: BridgeDrive为闭环轨迹规划提供了一个有效的锚点引导扩散框架，显著提升了自动驾驶规划性能，且具备实时部署的可行性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based planners have shown great promise for autonomous driving due
to their ability to capture multi-modal driving behaviors. However, guiding
these models effectively in reactive, closed-loop environments remains a
significant challenge. Simple conditioning often fails to provide sufficient
guidance in complex and dynamic driving scenarios. Recent work attempts to use
typical expert driving behaviors (i.e., anchors) to guide diffusion models but
relies on a truncated schedule, which introduces theoretical inconsistencies
and can compromise performance. To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a
novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory
planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that
effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans,
appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is
compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time
autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the
Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.

TL;DR: PSG-Agent是一个个性化和动态的LLM代理防护系统，通过挖掘用户交互历史创建个性化防护策略，并实现跨轮次风险监控，显著优于现有防护方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理防护存在两个根本问题：对所有用户应用统一防护策略，忽略同一行为对不同用户的风险差异；仅检查单次响应，无法追踪跨轮次风险累积。

Method: 首先通过挖掘交互历史中的稳定特征和实时查询状态创建个性化防护；其次在代理流程中部署专门监控组件（计划监控、工具防火墙、响应防护、记忆守护），跟踪跨轮次风险累积并生成可验证判定。

Result: 在医疗、金融和日常生活自动化等多个场景中验证，PSG-Agent显著优于LlamaGuard3和AGrail等现有代理防护方案。

Conclusion: PSG-Agent为LLM代理提供了可执行且可审计的个性化安全路径。

Abstract: Effective guardrails are essential for safely deploying LLM-based agents in
critical applications. Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from
two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all
users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being
safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks
evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we
propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents.
First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction
history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries,
generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second,
PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with
specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard,
Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable
verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including
healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user
profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including
LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward
personalized safety for LLM-based agents.

Motivation: 现有基于文本原理的行为克隆方法只能让小型语言模型模仿表面模式，无法传递底层的算法思维结构，导致逻辑鲁棒性不足

Method: 将推理重构为结构化生成过程：1) 将教师思维过程抽象为离散可解释语义信号序列；2) 使用多任务目标训练学生模型预测下一个语义信号并生成对应推理步骤

Result: 在多个挑战性推理基准测试中，该方法在准确性和逻辑一致性方面显著优于最先进的蒸馏方法

Conclusion: 该方法为创建真正具备推理能力而非仅能流利模仿的小型模型提供了有效路径

Abstract: The prevailing approach to distilling reasoning from Large Language Models
(LLMs)-behavioral cloning from textual rationales-is fundamentally limited. It
teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather
than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical
lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation
should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning
Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation
process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a
sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition)
that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task
objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the
reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that
signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the
student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a
suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency,
providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners,
not just fluent mimics.

Conclusion: 通过将RLVR从黑盒优化重新定义为结构自组织的可预测过程，为未来AI系统涌现推理能力的工程化提供了新的物理直觉。

Abstract: Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain
poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped
response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic
forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena
can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process
maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology
remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This
topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first
drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands''
form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp
growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by
phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory,
we propose \textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an
SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the
competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model.
Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms
standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By
recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of
structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for
engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.

Abstract: With the rise of multiplayer online games, real-time voice communication is
essential for team coordination. However, general ASR systems struggle with
gaming-specific challenges like short phrases, rapid speech, jargon, and noise,
leading to frequent errors. To address this, we propose the GO-AEC framework,
which integrates large language models, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
and a data augmentation strategy using LLMs and TTS. GO-AEC includes data

base. Experiments show GO-AEC reduces character error rate by 6.22% and
sentence error rate by 29.71%, significantly improving ASR accuracy in gaming
scenarios.

Conclusion: 研究证实了大型推理模型中中间推理在塑造模型输出中的功能性作用，深化了对推理token如何被用于答案生成的理解。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) generate explicit reasoning traces alongside
final answers, yet the extent to which these traces influence answer generation
remains unclear. In this work, we conduct a three-stage investigation into the
interplay between reasoning and answer generation in three distilled DeepSeek
R1 models. First, through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that including
explicit reasoning consistently improves answer quality across diverse domains.
Second, attention analysis reveals that answer tokens attend substantially to
reasoning tokens, with certain mid-layer Reasoning-Focus Heads (RFHs) closely
tracking the reasoning trajectory, including self-reflective cues. Third, we
apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the
dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that
perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers,
confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to
answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning
tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate
reasoning in shaping model outputs. Our data and code are publicly available at

Motivation: 搜索代理连接LLM与互联网，虽然能获取更广泛和更新的信息，但不可靠的搜索结果可能对终端用户构成安全威胁，建立了一个新的威胁面。

Method: 提出了一个系统化、可扩展且成本效益高的自动化红队框架，构建了SafeSearch基准，包含300个测试用例，覆盖五类风险（如错误信息和间接提示注入）。评估了三种代表性的搜索代理框架，涵盖搜索工作流、工具调用和深度研究。

Conclusion: 该框架在促进更安全的代理开发透明度方面具有重要价值，强调了搜索代理安全评估的必要性。

Abstract: Search agents connect LLMs to the Internet, enabling access to broader and
more up-to-date information. However, unreliable search results may also pose
safety threats to end users, establishing a new threat surface. In this work,
we conduct two in-the-wild experiments to demonstrate both the prevalence of
low-quality search results and their potential to misguide agent behaviors. To
counter this threat, we introduce an automated red-teaming framework that is
systematic, scalable, and cost-efficient, enabling lightweight and harmless
safety assessments of search agents. Building on this framework, we construct
the SafeSearch benchmark, which includes 300 test cases covering five
categories of risks (e.g., misinformation and indirect prompt injection). Using
this benchmark, we evaluate three representative search agent scaffolds,
covering search workflow, tool-calling, and deep research, across 7 proprietary
and 8 open-source backend LLMs. Our results reveal substantial vulnerabilities
of LLM-based search agents: when exposed to unreliable websites, the highest
ASR reached 90.5% for GPT-4.1-mini under a search workflow setting. Moreover,
our analysis highlights the limited effectiveness of common defense practices,
such as reminder prompting. This emphasizes the value of our framework in
promoting transparency for safer agent development. Our codebase and test cases
are publicly available: https://github.com/jianshuod/SafeSearch.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估稀疏自编码器(SAE)特征敏感性的可扩展方法，发现许多可解释特征敏感性较差，且平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAE特征分析主要关注激活示例，但无法揭示特征敏感性——即特征在类似文本上可靠激活的能力。

Method: 使用语言模型生成与特征激活示例具有相同语义属性的文本，然后测试特征是否在这些生成文本上激活。

Result: 敏感性衡量了特征质量的新维度，许多可解释特征敏感性较差；人类评估确认当特征在生成文本上不激活时，这些文本确实与原始激活示例相似。

Conclusion: 特征敏感性是评估单个特征和SAE架构的新维度，平均特征敏感性随SAE宽度增加而下降。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) features have become essential tools for mechanistic
interpretability research. SAE features are typically characterized by
examining their activating examples, which are often "monosemantic" and align
with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature
sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its
activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate
feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language
descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with
the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test
whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that
sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many
interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that
when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely
resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature
sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity
declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes
feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features
and SAE architectures.

Motivation: 现有多智能体方法依赖固定角色或浅层交互提示，难以检测和解决细粒度逻辑不一致问题。复杂医疗问题需要领域专业知识、患者特定信息以及结构化多视角推理。

Method: 每个智能体基于三段论（大前提、小前提和结论）将推理过程组织为显式逻辑树，实现透明推理。智能体通过多轮图引导讨论比较和迭代精炼逻辑树，通过错误纠正和矛盾解决达成共识。

Result: MedLA在MedDDx和标准医疗QA任务等挑战性基准测试中持续优于静态角色系统和单智能体基线。该框架在开源和商业LLM骨干网络上均能有效扩展，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MedLA为可信赖的医疗推理提供了一个可泛化的范式，通过逻辑驱动的方法解决了多智能体系统中的细粒度逻辑一致性问题。

Abstract: Answering complex medical questions requires not only domain expertise and
patient-specific information, but also structured and multi-perspective
reasoning. Existing multi-agent approaches often rely on fixed roles or shallow
interaction prompts, limiting their ability to detect and resolve fine-grained
logical inconsistencies. To address this, we propose \textsc{MedLA}, a
logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent
organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on
syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling
transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a
multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their
logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction
resolution. We demonstrate that \textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both
static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks
such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks. Furthermore, \textsc{MedLA}
scales effectively across both open-source and commercial LLM backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance and offering a generalizable paradigm
for trustworthy medical reasoning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced in reasoning when
optimized with reinforcement learning (RL) under verifiable rewards. Existing
methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM
reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To
mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a
novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn
interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where
policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively
determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and
more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately
internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's
inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been
well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning
paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO
consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and
RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.

Motivation: 随着低代码和模板化智能体开发平台的兴起，平台编排的智能体系统被广泛部署用于复杂推理任务，但这些系统很脆弱，缺乏系统性的故障根因识别方法。

Method: 构建AgentFail数据集（包含307个故障日志），利用反事实推理修复策略确保标注可靠性，开发故障根因分类法，并建立基于LLM的自动根因识别基准。

Result: 分类法能显著提高LLM的性能，但根因识别的最高准确率仅为33.6%，表明该任务仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 该研究为平台编排的智能体系统提供了可靠的故障根因数据集、分类法和基准，为开发更可靠的智能体系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through
tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and
template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly
build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile
and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure
root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these
platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct
a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each
with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We
additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure
the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a
taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution
across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a
benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in
which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show
that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its
utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at
most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light
of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such
agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure
root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy
and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of
more reliable agentic systems.

TL;DR: GUI-Shepherd是一个过程奖励模型，通过提供密集的逐步反馈来解决GUI任务中稀疏奖励和信用分配问题，在在线和离线任务中都显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长序列GUI任务的自主智能体受到稀疏奖励和难以处理的信用分配问题的阻碍，需要更有效的监督机制。

Method: 提出GUI-Shepherd过程奖励模型，在包含52k交互的大规模数据集上训练，该数据集包含人工标注分数和GPT-4o生成的解释，可作为RL训练奖励提供者和推理验证器。

Result: 在AndroidWorld基准测试中，通过多轮在线PPO将成功率提高7.7分；作为推理验证器带来5.1分提升；在AndroidControl基准测试中分别提升2.2分和4.3分。

Conclusion: 高保真过程监督对于构建更强大的GUI智能体至关重要，并提供了一个可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous agents for long-sequence Graphical User Interface tasks are
hindered by sparse rewards and the intractable credit assignment problem. To
address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model
that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is
trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features
human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve
both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As
far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process
supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon
tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark,
GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO,
significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used
as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits
generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points
as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results
establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more
capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.

Abstract: A central challenge in explainable AI, particularly in the visual domain, is
producing explanations grounded in human-understandable concepts. To tackle
this, we introduce OCEAN (Object-Centric Explananda via Agent Negotiation), a
novel, inherently interpretable framework built on object-centric
representations and a transparent multi-agent reasoning process. The
game-theoretic reasoning process drives agents to agree on coherent and
discriminative evidence, resulting in a faithful and interpretable
decision-making process. We train OCEAN end-to-end and benchmark it against
standard visual classifiers and popular posthoc explanation tools like GradCAM
and LIME across two diagnostic multi-object datasets. Our results demonstrate
competitive performance with respect to state-of-the-art black-box models with
a faithful reasoning process, which was reflected by our user study, where
participants consistently rated OCEAN's explanations as more intuitive and
trustworthy.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型方法在化学反应条件推荐中很少解释推荐理由，限制了其在高风险科学工作流程中的实用性。

Method: 将条件预测重构为基于证据的推理任务，通过机理基础、多通道召回、约束感知的智能体辩论和理由聚合四个步骤来实现。

Conclusion: ChemMAS为科学发现中的可解释AI建立了新范式，通过多智能体系统实现了准确且可解释的化学反应条件推荐。

Abstract: The chemical reaction recommendation is to select proper reaction condition
parameters for chemical reactions, which is pivotal to accelerating chemical
science. With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is
growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for
reaction condition recommendation. Despite their success, existing methods
rarely explain the rationale behind the recommended reaction conditions,
limiting their utility in high-stakes scientific workflows. In this work, we
propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an
evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic
grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale
aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded
in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS
achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms
general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable,
human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI
in scientific discovery.

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large
language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth.
This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating
content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in
current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale
vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm
categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes
across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a
comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it
includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the
corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator
fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and
safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other
baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two
widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as
a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.

Abstract: E-commerce agents contribute greatly to helping users complete their
e-commerce needs. To promote further research and application of e-commerce
agents, benchmarking frameworks are introduced for evaluating LLM agents in the
e-commerce domain. Despite the progress, current benchmarks lack evaluating
agents' capability to handle mixed-type e-commerce dialogue and complex domain
rules. To address the issue, this work first introduces a novel corpus, termed
Mix-ECom, which is constructed based on real-world customer-service dialogues
with post-processing to remove user privacy and add CoT process. Specifically,
Mix-ECom contains 4,799 samples with multiply dialogue types in each e-commerce
dialogue, covering four dialogue types (QA, recommendation, task-oriented
dialogue, and chit-chat), three e-commerce task types (pre-sales, logistics,
after-sales), and 82 e-commerce rules. Furthermore, this work build baselines
on Mix-Ecom and propose a dynamic framework to further improve the performance.
Results show that current e-commerce agents lack sufficient capabilities to
handle e-commerce dialogues, due to the hallucination cased by complex domain
rules. The dataset will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主AI系统的快速发展带来了显著风险，其固有的不可预测性和涌现行为使得传统验证方法不再适用，需要转向概率保证方法。

Method: 作为检查层观察agent的原始I/O，将其抽象为状态模型转换的正式事件，使用在线学习动态构建和更新马尔可夫决策过程来建模agent的涌现行为，并通过概率模型检查实时验证定量属性。

Result: 提出了AgentGuard框架，实现了对自主AI系统的运行时验证和概率保证。

Conclusion: AgentGuard为自主AI系统提供了一种新的动态概率保证范式，能够有效应对传统验证方法的不足。

Abstract: The rapid evolution to autonomous, agentic AI systems introduces significant
risks due to their inherent unpredictability and emergent behaviors; this also
renders traditional verification methods inadequate and necessitates a shift
towards probabilistic guarantees where the question is no longer if a system
will fail, but the probability of its failure within given constraints. This
paper presents AgentGuard, a framework for runtime verification of Agentic AI
systems that provides continuous, quantitative assurance through a new paradigm
called Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance. AgentGuard operates as an inspection
layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events
corresponding to transitions in a state model. It then uses online learning to
dynamically build and update a Markov Decision Process (MDP) that formally
models the agent's emergent behavior. Using probabilistic model checking, the
framework then verifies quantitative properties in real-time.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了基于结果奖励会导致错误中间步骤被强化的传统观点，揭示了基于结果的奖励实际上会惩罚错误行为，并识别出智能体强化学习中的梯度耦合问题，提出了通过分类好坏动作来缓解梯度干扰的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为基于结果的奖励会导致奖励校准错误，错误地奖励有缺陷的中间步骤，从而在训练中强化不良行为。但本文发现这种观点存在问题，需要重新审视基于结果奖励的实际效果。

Method: 提出训练actor对好坏动作进行分类，以分离好坏动作的嵌入表示，从而减轻梯度干扰。通过大量实验验证方法的有效性。

Result: 研究发现基于结果的奖励实际上确保了错误中间步骤具有负优势，应该惩罚这些错误行为。同时识别出梯度耦合问题会导致某些错误动作被增强。

Conclusion: 基于结果的奖励不会强化错误中间步骤，反而会惩罚它们。梯度耦合是智能体强化学习中的关键问题，通过分类好坏动作可以有效缓解梯度干扰。

Abstract: Building autonomous agents capable of solving long-horizon, real-world tasks
has garnered significant research interest. But outcome based rewards may cause
reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward
to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad
actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based
reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which
means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting
for the ``squeezing effect", the probability mass of good actions should
increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows
that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify
gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the
input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited,
therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can
inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input
observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some
flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the
actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad
actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows
its effectiveness.

Abstract: Fibring of modal logics is a well-established formalism for combining
countable families of modal logics into a single fibred language with common
semantics, characterized by fibred models. Inspired by this formalism, fibring
of neural networks was introduced as a neurosymbolic framework for combining
learning and reasoning in neural networks. Fibring of neural networks uses the
(pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing
the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the
original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural
networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this
paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models
\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we
then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.
Longer-term, the goal of this paper is to open the way for the use of fibring
as a formalism for interpreting the logical theories learnt by neural networks
with the tools of computational logic.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在奖励塑造时依赖手工惩罚和偏好设定，容易因过度偏置而失败，需要更灵活地利用训练指标。

Method: CANON方法将采样响应按目标指标值高低分组，通过组间比较衡量哪种指标趋势贡献更好性能，并在同组内识别更好响应。

Conclusion: CANON方法能够有效利用训练指标而不预设方向，在性能-成本权衡中产生更优的Pareto前沿。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language
models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning
capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical
reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length,
have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in
reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward
or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and
preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without
careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased
and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage
estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without
presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses
into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures
which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group
comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In
summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across
three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied
to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more
favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.

Conclusion: \ourmodel方法在保持可解释性的同时实现了准确的论文自动筛选，扩展了可用的信息源类型。

Abstract: Searching, filtering and analysing scientific literature are time-consuming
tasks when performing a systematic literature review. With the rise of
artificial intelligence, some steps in the review process are progressively
being automated. In particular, machine learning for automatic paper selection
can greatly reduce the effort required to identify relevant literature in
scientific databases. We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach,
called \ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a
literature search process is relevant. \ourmodel builds an interpretable
rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a
grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \ourmodel to
easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not
considered by state-of-the-art methods. Our experiments demonstrate that it is
possible to generate accurate classifiers without impairing interpretability
and using configurable information sources not supported so far.

TL;DR: TusoAI是一个自主开发计算方法的AI系统，通过整合领域知识和迭代优化，在科学任务中超越现有方法并发现新生物学知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学发现因手动开发计算工具而缓慢，现有AI系统要么使用现有方法进行分析，要么开发通用机器学习模型，未能有效整合特定科学领域的非结构化知识。

Method: TusoAI采用知识树表示整合领域知识，执行迭代的领域特定优化和模型诊断，通过候选解决方案池改进性能。

Result: 在单细胞RNA-seq数据去噪和卫星地球监测等任务中，TusoAI超越了最先进的专家方法、MLE代理和科学AI代理。在遗传学应用中改进了现有计算方法，发现了9个自身免疫疾病与T细胞亚型的新关联和7个疾病变异与靶基因的未报告链接。

Conclusion: TusoAI展示了AI系统能够自主开发优化的计算方法，加速科学发现并揭示新的生物学见解。

Abstract: Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of
computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such
tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review
literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data,
and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature,
reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering
new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing
LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing
computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for
general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured
knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an
agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation
function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the
application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree
representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model
diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We
conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI
outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI
agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and
satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in
genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology,
including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes
and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their
target genes. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/Alistair-Turcan/TusoAI.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) and agent techniques for data analysis (a.k.a
LLM/Agent-as-Data-Analyst) have demonstrated substantial impact in both
academica and industry. In comparison with traditional rule or small-model
based approaches, (agentic) LLMs enable complex data understanding, natural
language interfaces, semantic analysis functions, and autonomous pipeline
orchestration. The technical evolution further distills five key design goals
for intelligent data analysis agents, namely semantic-aware design,
modality-hybrid integration, autonomous pipelines, tool-augmented workflows,
and support for open-world tasks. From a modality perspective, we review
LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering
for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data
(e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling),
(iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding,
programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g.,
data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes). Finally, we outline the
remaining challenges and propose several insights and practical directions for
advancing LLM/Agent-powered data analysis.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 单次运行的LLM排行榜不可靠，研究发现83%的切片在单次运行中会出现排名反转。建议使用≥2次重复运行来提升评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM排行榜通常依赖单次随机运行，但需要多少次重复才能获得可靠结论尚不明确。本文旨在评估额外重复运行的价值。

Method: 在AI4Math基准上重新评估8个最先进模型，每个设置进行3次独立运行。使用混合效应逻辑回归、领域级边际均值、排名不稳定分析和运行间可靠性评估。

Result: 单次运行排行榜脆弱：83%的切片在单次运行中至少出现一次排名反转。平均运行能适度减少标准误（从1次到3次约5%），但排名收益显著；两次运行可消除约83%的单次运行反转。

Conclusion: 建议将评估视为实验，报告不确定性，在随机解码下使用≥2次重复运行。这些实践能在保持小团队可行性的同时提升鲁棒性，使模型比较更符合实际可靠性。

Abstract: LLM leaderboards often rely on single stochastic runs, but how many
repetitions are required for reliable conclusions remains unclear. We
re-evaluate eight state-of-the-art models on the AI4Math Benchmark with three
independent runs per setting. Using mixed-effects logistic regression,
domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run
reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings
shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\%) invert at
least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero
sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass
correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\sim$5\% from one to
three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\sim$83\% of single-run
inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation
as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\geq 2$ repetitions under
stochastic decoding. These practices improve robustness while remaining
feasible for small teams and help align model comparisons with real-world
reliability.

Abstract: Tool-integrated reasoning has emerged as a key focus for enabling agentic
applications. Among these, DeepResearch Agents have gained significant
attention for their strong performance on complex, open-ended
information-seeking tasks. We introduce Fathom-DeepResearch, an agentic system
composed of two specialized models. The first is Fathom-Search-4B, a DeepSearch
model trained from Qwen3-4B and optimized for evidence-based investigation
through live web search and targeted webpage querying. Its training combines
three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent
self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source
grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes
multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum
pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and
(iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive
behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory
breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of
tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is
Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn
DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for
comprehensive synthesis. Evaluated on DeepSearch benchmarks (SimpleQA, FRAMES,
WebWalker, Seal0, MuSiQue) and DeepResearch-Bench, the system achieves
state-of-the-art performance in the open-weights category while demonstrating
strong generalization to diverse reasoning tasks including HLE, AIME-25,
GPQA-Diamond, and MedQA.

Abstract: This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing
and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language
interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly
addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users
to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface,
translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to
overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to
transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning
framework that explains the "why" behind every decision, allowing for full
interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business
rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance
mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions:
it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance
against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the
detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical
depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations
from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative
evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation
framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The
agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to
perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and
generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach
creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered
agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.

Motivation: 发现大型推理模型的最终答案经常与自身的推理轨迹相矛盾，假设这是由于思维链推理和记忆检索两种竞争机制同时存在导致的。

Method: 进行控制实验，在推理过程中引入误导线索或在检索过程中提供错误答案。提出FARL框架，结合记忆遗忘和强化学习来抑制检索捷径。

Result: 实验证实思维链推理和记忆检索确实同时运作，其相对主导地位受问题领域、模型规模和微调方法等因素影响。FARL框架能有效促进推理主导行为。

Conclusion: 当前推理微调范式存在局限性，模型会利用检索机制作为捷径。FARL框架通过抑制检索捷径，能够增强可泛化的推理能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit unprecedented capabilities in solving
complex problems through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, recent
studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning
traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing
mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test
this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with
misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our
results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate
simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors:
problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement
learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in
current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval
mechanism as a shortcut, effectively "hacking" the reward signal and
undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we
introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning
with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts
during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and
enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: RPO能有效解决人类偏好数据中的噪声问题，理论上证明在完美校准模型下可收敛到数据集真实噪声水平，实践上显著提升对齐算法性能。

Abstract: Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all
underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are
homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data
is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human
preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a
discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which
can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge,
we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of
each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point
in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by
establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their
corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic
transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts,
elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust
preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a
perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise
level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a
meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment
algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3
models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%,
respectively.

*Sijia Liu,Niklas Muennighoff,Kawin Ethayarajh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在线对齐方法（如GRPO）比离线对齐方法（如DPO）性能更好，这是因为在线策略采样能更好地模拟人类感知的模型输出分布，而PPO/GRPO中的裁剪机制则反映了人类对概率的感知偏差。作者提出了一种将人类概率感知偏差显式融入对齐目标的方法，创建了"humanline"变体，即使使用离线数据也能达到在线方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线对齐方法为何优于离线对齐方法，从行为经济学的角度提供人类中心化的解释，并探索如何在不牺牲性能的情况下实现更快速、廉价和灵活的后训练。

Method: 基于前景理论，提出在线策略采样能更好地近似人类感知的模型输出分布。将人类对概率的感知偏差显式融入DPO/KTO/GRPO等对齐目标中，创建humanline变体。

Result: humanline变体即使使用离线非策略数据训练，也能在可验证和不可验证任务上达到与在线方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: 在线/离线二分法本身并非最大化人类效用的关键因素，通过模拟人类感知偏差的选择性训练可以达到相同效果，为更高效的对齐方法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline
alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral
economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online
on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what
the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to
just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive
probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our
theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental
to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by
selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception,
rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would
allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing
performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly
incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like
DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that
these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can
match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and
unverifiable tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在多机器人协作中的基本权衡问题：声明式方法在动态环境中缺乏适应性，而迭代方法计算成本过高且随团队规模和任务复杂度扩展性差。

Method: 提出ELHPlan框架，采用循环过程：1)构建意图绑定的动作序列；2)主动验证冲突和可行性；3)通过针对性机制精炼问题；4)执行验证过的动作。使用动作链作为基本规划单元。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，ELHPlan达到相当的任务成功率，同时仅消耗最先进方法24%的token。

Conclusion: ELHPlan为基于LLM的多智能体规划系统建立了新的效率-有效性前沿，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but
face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic
environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs
that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose
ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions
explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive.
ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action
sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining
issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This
design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning
horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose
comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning
time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments
on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable
task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by
state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new
efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.

TL;DR: FR-Ponder是一个无需修改骨干模型权重的推理计算分配框架，通过潜在向量引导实现实例自适应的推理深度控制，在保持任务精度的同时减少计算浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Best-of-N和多数投票对所有输入使用统一推理深度，导致简单问题计算浪费而复杂问题推理不足。需要一种能根据问题复杂度自适应分配计算资源的方法。

Method: 使用小于1M参数的控制器观察隐藏状态，通过添加预计算的潜在引导向量来决定停止或继续推理。采用GRPO作为奖励信号来调节推理深度，通过课程学习和奖励工程实现计算分配与问题难度的关联。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500数据集上，FR-Ponder改善了计算-精度边界，以更低的FLOPs获得匹配的精度，优于早期退出基线方法。分析显示学习到的计算分配与问题难度相关。

Conclusion: FR-Ponder证明了通过潜在向量引导实现实例自适应推理深度的可行性，在不修改骨干模型权重的情况下有效平衡了性能与计算成本。

Abstract: Test-time compute has emerged as a key paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning,
yet prevailing approaches like Best-of-N and majority voting apply uniform
depth across inputs, wasting computation on simple queries while potentially
under-thinking complex ones. We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph,
backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning
compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden
states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a
pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the
latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO
from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model
to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance
performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth,
achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum
learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute
allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder
improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better
matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without
modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering
directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem
difficulty.

Motivation: 尽管模型融合在实践中广泛应用，但缺乏定量规则来预测随着专家数量增加或模型规模扩大时的收益回报。

Method: 通过实证研究语言模型融合的交叉熵缩放规律，分析不同架构和方法（Average、TA、TIES、DARE）下的融合效果。

Result: 识别出紧凑的幂律关系：模型容量相关的下限随模型能力降低，而融合尾部在专家数量上显示明显的收益递减。该定律在领域内和跨领域都成立。

Conclusion: 该缩放定律使融合从启发式实践转变为可计算、可规划的替代多任务训练的方法，为分布式生成AI提供了可预测的缩放原则。

Abstract: We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by
cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative
rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We
identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the
size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail
exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds
in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse
architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust
regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts
are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why
gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the
base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive
planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide
when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding
experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a
computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This
suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains
can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward
AGI-level systems.

Motivation: 大型推理模型存在过度思考问题，产生过长输出导致高延迟，现有提前退出机制依赖探测机制带来额外开销

Method: 利用隐藏状态进行推测解码，从轻量级草稿模型直接预测未来token和提前退出信号

Result: 平均生成长度减少66%，端到端延迟提升2.5倍，且不影响准确性

Conclusion: 隐藏状态可为高效推理提供有效信号，SpecExit框架在减少延迟和输出长度方面表现优异

Abstract: Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models
(LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and
incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world
deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed
to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach
can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy.
However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead
that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their
generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states
in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts
both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft
model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements,
reducing average generation length by 66\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in
end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without
compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden
states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of
hidden states for efficient reasoning. Our code is available at

*Yuwei Hu,Xinyi Huang,Zhewei Wei,Yongchao Liu,Chuntao Hong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文指出现有图推理方法的问题，提出将推理重点从复制图算法转向设计图算法，并构建了更难的GraphAlgorithm基准。提出的Simple-RTC方法在现有基准上达到近乎完美的准确率，在新基准上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM图推理研究存在方法和基准问题，模型性能不佳。作者发现基础模型因推理重点不当而被低估，需要重新思考图推理的发展方向。

Method: 提出Simple-RTC方法：先引导LLM设计图算法，然后编码解决图推理任务。构建了包含239个不同图问题和3,041个测试实例的GraphAlgorithm基准。

Result: Simple-RTC在现有基准上达到近乎完美的准确率，在GraphAlgorithm基准上显著优于GPT-4o-mini和所有先前方法。

Conclusion: 基础模型通过重新定向推理重点可以轻松解决大多数图推理任务，Simple-RTC为未来LLM图推理研究提供了强大基线。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for Graph Reasoning have been extensively
studied over the past two years, involving enabling LLMs to understand graph
structures and reason on graphs to solve various graph problems, with graph
algorithm problems being the most prevalent. Recent studies underscore the
potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is
underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and
benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should
strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely
underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning
focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily
solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the
graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging
GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041
test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a
simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which
guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph
reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing
benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on
the GraphAlgorithm benchmark. This strong baseline encourages further
advancements in LLMs for Graph Reasoning in the future.

TL;DR: 提出风险敏感强化学习框架RS-GRPO，解决RLVR在LLM推理任务中的探索困境，通过风险寻求目标在保持单解准确率的同时提升多解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在探索困境：预训练LLM的尖锐初始策略限制了标准RL算法的探索范围，导致只能提升单解准确率(pass@1)而抑制解多样性和多解性能(pass@k)。

Method: 采用风险敏感强化学习框架，使用在均值和最大奖励间插值的风险寻求目标，提出RS-GRPO算法，通过放大从困难提示中学习来驱动深度探索。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准和五种不同LLM上，RS-GRPO一致提升pass@k性能，同时保持或增强pass@1准确率。

Conclusion: RS-GRPO是简单易实现的解决方案，有效克服RLVR的探索困境，促进新推理策略的发现而非仅提炼现有能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective
for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. However,
existing methods suffer from an exploration dilemma: the sharply peaked initial
policies of pre-trained LLMs confine standard RL algorithms to a narrow set of
solutions, boosting single-solution accuracy (pass@1) but suppressing solution
diversity and multi-solution performance (pass@k). As a result, RLVR often
distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning
strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement
Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that
interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm,
Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying
learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement,
requiring only minor code modifications. On six mathematical reasoning
benchmarks and with five different LLMs, RS-GRPO consistently improves pass@k
performance while maintaining or enhancing pass@1 accuracy.

Abstract: Messaging patients is a critical part of healthcare communication, helping to
improve things like medication adherence and healthy behaviors. However,
traditional mobile message design has significant limitations due to its
inability to explore the high-dimensional design space. We develop PAME-AI, a
novel approach for Patient Messaging Creation and Optimization using Agentic
AI. Built on the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy, PAME-AI
offers a structured framework to move from raw data to actionable insights for
high-performance messaging design. PAME-AI is composed of a system of
specialized computational agents that progressively transform raw experimental
data into actionable message design strategies. We demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness through a two-stage experiment, comprising of 444,691 patient
encounters in Stage 1 and 74,908 in Stage 2. The best-performing generated
message achieved 68.76% engagement compared to the 61.27% baseline,
representing a 12.2\% relative improvement in click-through rates. This agentic
architecture enables parallel processing, hypothesis validation, and continuous
learning, making it particularly suitable for large-scale healthcare
communication optimization.

Motivation: 大型推理模型的多步推理特性带来了新的安全挑战，传统对齐方法无法解决推理过程中的雪球效应——微小偏差在思维链中逐步放大，导致有害合规或过度拒绝。

Method: 提出AdvChain对齐范式，构建包含诱惑-纠正和犹豫-纠正样本的数据集，通过对抗性思维链调优训练模型从有害推理漂移和不必要谨慎中恢复。

Result: 实验表明AdvChain显著增强了对越狱攻击和思维链劫持的鲁棒性，同时大幅减少对良性提示的过度拒绝，在不损害推理能力的情况下实现了更好的安全-效用平衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作为构建更鲁棒可靠的推理模型确立了新方向，通过动态自我纠正机制解决思维链推理中的安全挑战。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex problem-solving through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the
multi-step nature of CoT introduces new safety challenges that extend beyond
conventional language model alignment. We identify a failure mode in current
safety CoT tuning methods: the \textit{snowball effect}, where minor reasoning
deviations progressively amplify throughout the thought process, leading to
either harmful compliance or excessive refusal. This effect stems from models
being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to
self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment
paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT
tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing
Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to
recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive
experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against
jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal
on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without
compromising reasoning capabilities. Our work establishes a new direction for
building more robust and reliable reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成(RAG)方法在处理知识密集型任务时存在信息碎片化和知识结构建模不足的问题，而图结构虽然能自然建模知识关系，但LLMs无法有效推理图结构数据。

Method: 提出QuadGraph四层抽象统一异构知识源，构建34M参数的图基础模型(GFM)联合捕获图拓扑和文本语义，并与LLMs集成增强推理，采用混合精度训练和分布式消息传递实现可扩展性。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，G-reasoner持续优于最先进基线，显著提升LLM推理能力，并实现了强大的效率和跨图泛化能力。

Conclusion: G-reasoner通过统一图与语言基础模型，有效解决了现有图增强RAG方法的局限性，为知识密集型推理任务提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by
static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs
struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak
modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model
relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot
effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG
(GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and
enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc
graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder
scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present
G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation
models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our
approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies
heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on
this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly
captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to
enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and
efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are
implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six
benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency
and cross-graph generalization.

Conclusion: SCI-VerifyBench和SCI-Verifier为科学验证提供了原则性框架，既提供系统性评估，又为增强LLM在科学领域的可靠性和适用性提供了实用途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
reasoning, the complexity of answer formats and the diversity of equivalent
expressions make answer verification a critical yet challenging task. Existing
verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations:
(a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient
disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b)
heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces
their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their
cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose
solutions at both the data and model levels. On the data side, we construct
SCI-VerifyBench, a cross-disciplinary benchmark covering mathematics, physics,
biology, chemistry, and general scientific QA. The benchmark is built from real
LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations
that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert
annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of
verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of
reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified
reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training,
SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment
capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together,
SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific
verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to
enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.

Motivation: 现有医疗多模态大语言模型在初步试验中表现良好，但存在早期证据解释不稳定的关键失败模式，导致幻觉和推理轨迹分支，最终产生全局不一致的结论。

Method: MedMMV通过多样化短轨迹稳定推理，在幻觉检测器监督下将中间步骤基于结构化证据图，并使用组合不确定性评分器聚合候选路径。

Result: 在六个医疗基准上，MedMMV将准确性提升高达12.7%，并展现出更优越的可靠性。盲法医师评估确认MedMMV显著提高了推理真实性而不牺牲信息内容。

Conclusion: 通过可验证的多智能体过程控制不稳定性，该框架为在高风险领域（如临床决策支持）部署可信赖AI系统提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
promising performance on medical benchmarks and in preliminary trials as
clinical assistants. Yet, our pilot audit of diagnostic cases uncovers a
critical failure mode: instability in early evidence interpretation precedes
hallucination, creating branching reasoning trajectories that cascade into
globally inconsistent conclusions. This highlights the need for clinical
reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing
auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal
multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV
stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate
steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination
Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On
six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more
critically, demonstrates superior reliability. Blind physician evaluations
confirm that MedMMV substantially increases reasoning truthfulness without
sacrificing informational content. By controlling instability through a
verifiable, multi-agent process, our framework provides a robust path toward
deploying trustworthy AI systems in high-stakes domains like clinical decision
support.

Motivation: FinTech行业快速发展，但LLM微调可能产生不专业的回复，缺乏领域特定数据集导致现有研究只关注孤立组件。

Method: 引入Fin-Vault数据集(1,417个标注多轮对话)，开发Fin-Ally模型整合常识推理、礼貌性和对话动态，使用COMET-BART嵌入常识上下文并通过DPO优化。

Conclusion: 该方法为FinTech领域提供了下一代AI解决方案，通过整合常识推理和人类对齐响应生成专业金融建议。

Abstract: The exponential technological breakthrough of the FinTech industry has
significantly enhanced user engagement through sophisticated advisory chatbots.
However, large-scale fine-tuning of LLMs can occasionally yield unprofessional
or flippant remarks, such as ``With that money, you're going to change the
world,'' which, though factually correct, can be contextually inappropriate and
erode user trust. The scarcity of domain-specific datasets has led previous
studies to focus on isolated components, such as reasoning-aware frameworks or
the enhancement of human-like response generation. To address this research
gap, we present Fin-Solution 2.O, an advanced solution that 1) introduces the
multi-turn financial conversational dataset, Fin-Vault, and 2) incorporates a
unified model, Fin-Ally, which integrates commonsense reasoning, politeness,
and human-like conversational dynamics. Fin-Ally is powered by
COMET-BART-embedded commonsense context and optimized with a Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) mechanism to generate human-aligned responses. The novel
Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables
Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized
budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning. Our
comprehensive results demonstrate that incorporating commonsense context
enables language models to generate more refined, textually precise, and
professionally grounded financial guidance, positioning this approach as a
next-generation AI solution for the FinTech sector. Dataset and codes are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于固定预算采样策略估计推理步骤质量，并在自动数据生成过程中进行大规模搜索空间导航，导致效率低下且缺乏灵活性。

Method: AMCS框架在节点值估计和路径扩展层面实现自适应动态搜索：一方面自适应分配样本给不确定的推理步骤，另一方面通过具有时间自适应策略的蒙特卡洛算法增强路径扩展，从广泛探索逐步转向利用最有希望的方向。

Result: Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS在MATH500上达到76.2%准确率，优于所有基线PRM。7B模型在AMCS监督下超越了72B模型，并在分布外问题上保持优势，显示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AMCS通过自适应搜索策略显著提升了过程奖励模型的数据生成效率和性能，为复杂数学推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward
Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of
large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps
based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to
perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting
in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose
Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation
from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value
estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation
by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer
samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances
the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive
policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward
exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale
dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training
PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive
experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results
show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500
with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised
by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.
Moreover, Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS maintains consistent advantages on
out-of-distribution problems, demonstrating strong generalization capability.

TL;DR: PRISM是一个两阶段数学推理框架，通过策略规划和定向执行来动态选择最适合的推理策略，解决了单一策略无法适应问题特定需求的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用固定策略进行数学推理，但单一策略无法适应问题特定需求，且在效果和效率之间缺乏权衡。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，将数学推理解耦为策略规划和定向执行两个阶段。首先构建多策略偏好数据集MathStrat，然后训练轻量级策略适配器获得四种推理策略的置信度分布，在推理时基于预测置信度动态选择推理方法。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，PRISM始终优于单个策略和集成基线，在不同基础模型上实现了0.9%到7.6%的性能提升，自适应路由方法在各种模型架构上都显示出强大优势。

Conclusion: PRISM通过自适应策略选择有效提升了数学推理的性能，证明了动态策略路由在解决数学推理问题中的有效性。

Abstract: Existing methods usually leverage a fixed strategy, such as natural language
reasoning, code-augmented reasoning, tool-integrated reasoning, or
ensemble-based reasoning, to guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform
mathematical reasoning. Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot
adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between
effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and
Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that
decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and
targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference
dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and
computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a
lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence
distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time,
an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on
predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for
high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive
scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases.
Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble
baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different
base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits
for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code
is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.

TL;DR: 提出Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO)方法，通过干预推理过程来提升大型推理模型的安全性，在保持推理性能的同时显著降低有害内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型的链式推理中常包含有害内容，即使最终回答看似安全，这种不安全推理仍可能被恶意用户利用，因此需要专门对齐推理过程的安全性。

Method: IPO方法通过用安全触发步骤替换合规步骤，构建强信号偏好学习对，强制执行安全推理。基于三个关键发现：安全推理由关键安全触发步骤巩固、合规线索与不安全延续强相关、纠正干预能可靠引导不安全轨迹转向安全路径。

Result: 在越狱和对抗性安全基准测试中，IPO显著改善了推理和响应的整体安全性，相比SFT和RL基线将有害性相对降低超过30%，同时在多样化推理任务上保持优异性能。

Conclusion: 结果表明对推理过程进行显式对齐的重要性，为构建更安全的大型推理模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex
problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content
that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this
issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance
of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks
in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by
malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of
reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution.
However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout
diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first
delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical
insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps
of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe
continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe
trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened
Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning
by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs
for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and
adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall
safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and
RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while
preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results
highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a

Abstract: With the increasing complexity of industrial systems, there is a pressing
need for predictive maintenance to avoid costly downtime and disastrous
outcomes that could be life-threatening in certain domains. With the growing
popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine
learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for
efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time
intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and
preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements
for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this
evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that
continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset
performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such
as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This
paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the
temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial
engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological
requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception
to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a
layered architecture of the digital twin technology, as well as a taxonomy of
the technology-enabled industrial engineering applications systems, middleware,
and the used Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We provide insights into these
systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart digital-twin
industrial engineering ecosystem. We discuss future research directions in
digital twin for predictive maintenance in industrial engineering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ContextPRM方法，通过建模领域无关的逻辑流程而非验证特定领域知识，提升过程奖励模型在非数学领域的泛化能力，在MMLU-Pro的9个非数学领域平均准确率提升6.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型在数学领域表现良好，但由于缺乏领域特定训练数据和基于知识的学习模式，在其他领域泛化能力有限。

Method: 将学习目标从验证领域特定知识转向建模领域无关的逻辑流程，关注思维链步骤间的上下文连贯性，采用新的数据标注和训练框架。

Result: ContextPRM在MMLU-Pro的9个非数学领域（法律、历史、哲学等）通过加权多数投票实现平均准确率提升6.5%，显著优于VersaPRM的2.2%提升和其他数学导向PRM的0.5%增益。

Conclusion: 通过建模逻辑流程而非特定领域知识，ContextPRM在数学和非数学领域都表现出色，证明了该方法在提升模型跨领域泛化能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) have demonstrated significant efficacy in
enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by leveraging test-time scaling (TTS). However, while most PRMs exhibit
substantial gains in mathematical domains, the scarcity of domain-specific
training data and knowledge-based learning patterns limits their generalization
ability when faced with other domains. To address this limitation, we shift the
learning objective from verifying domain-specific knowledge to modeling
domain-agnostic logical flow. Centering on contextual coherence between
chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data
annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization
capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model,
ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the
majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine
non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy,
significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from
other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across
both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.

Motivation: 解决约束获取中被动方法容易过拟合（学习到虚假全局约束）而纯主动方法查询密集的问题，特别是在数据有限场景下。

Method: 集成被动学习生成初始候选约束，基于机器学习先验的概率置信度进行查询驱动的交互式精炼，专门子集探索机制从被拒绝候选约束中恢复有效子结构，最后主动学习确保模型完整性。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据有限场景下实现了鲁棒且实用的约束获取，是约束获取领域的重大进展。

Abstract: Manual modeling in Constraint Programming is a substantial bottleneck, which
Constraint Acquisition (CA) aims to automate. However, passive CA methods are
prone to over-fitting, often learning models that include spurious global
constraints when trained on limited data, while purely active methods can be
query-intensive. We introduce a hybrid CA framework specifically designed to
address the challenge of over-fitting in CA. Our approach integrates passive
learning for initial candidate generation, a query-driven interactive
refinement phase that utilizes probabilistic confidence scores (initialized by
machine learning priors) to systematically identify over-fitted constraints,
and a specialized subset exploration mechanism to recover valid substructures
from rejected candidates. A final active learning phase ensures model
completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our
interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model
coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with
manageable query complexity. This framework represents a substantial
advancement towards robust and practical constraint acquisition in data-limited
scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to Dynamic Artificial Neural Networks
(D-ANNs) for multi-task demand forecasting called Neuroplastic Multi-Task
Network (NMT-Net). Unlike conventional methods focusing on inference-time
dynamics or computational efficiency, our proposed method enables structural
adaptability of the computational graph during training, inspired by
neuroplasticity as seen in biological systems. Each new task triggers a dynamic
network adaptation, including similarity-based task identification and
selective training of candidate ANN heads, which are then assessed and
integrated into the model based on their performance. We evaluated our
framework using three real-world multi-task demand forecasting datasets from
Kaggle. We demonstrated its superior performance and consistency, achieving
lower RMSE and standard deviation compared to traditional baselines and
state-of-the-art multi-task learning methods. NMT-Net offers a scalable,
adaptable solution for multi-task and continual learning in time series
prediction. The complete code for NMT-Net is available from our GitHub
repository.

Motivation: 传统组合优化问题需要手工设计启发式算法，耗费大量领域知识和实现努力。现有基于LLM的自动启发式设计方法容易陷入局部最优。

Method: EvoPH框架整合岛屿迁移模型和精英选择算法，模拟多样化的启发式种群，在性能反馈指导下共同进化提示和启发式算法。

Result: 在旅行商问题和装箱问题上的实验结果表明，EvoPH在两个数据集上都取得了相对于最优解的最低相对误差。

Conclusion: EvoPH推动了基于LLM的自动算法设计领域的发展，通过共同进化框架有效避免了局部最优问题。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.

Motivation: 先前世界模型无法准确预测复杂环境中的物体交互，而实际应用如机器人学习需要从离线数据中学习，因为环境交互可能不安全且缓慢。

Method: 使用快捷强制目标和高效transformer架构实现实时交互推理，从少量数据中学习通用动作条件，主要从多样化无标签视频中提取知识。

Conclusion: 这项工作为想象训练提供了可扩展的解决方案，标志着向智能代理迈出了一步。

Abstract: World models learn general knowledge from videos and simulate experience for
training behaviors in imagination, offering a path towards intelligent agents.
However, previous world models have been unable to accurately predict object
interactions in complex environments. We introduce Dreamer 4, a scalable agent
that learns to solve control tasks by reinforcement learning inside of a fast
and accurate world model. In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model
accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming
previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time
interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and
an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent
agents.

Abstract: Humans quickly learn new concepts from a small number of examples.
Replicating this capacity with Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems has proven
to be challenging. When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an
evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we
propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can
teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e.,
examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be
able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our
objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge.
Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a
limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most
representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply
our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where
the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on
human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our
experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100
examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples.
We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning
method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize
more efficiently.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通信评估的基本假设，即在混合人群（如人类和人工智能）中，即使感知环境不同，通过通信能否实现真正的相互理解。

Method: 使用信号游戏作为代理，研究个体在仅通过通信信号和交互结果（奖励）的情况下，如何发展新词汇来协调。个体不观察其他个体如何使用信号。

Result: 人群总是收敛到最优协调水平，但有时会形成"成功的误解"——个体对信号有不同的解释但仍能协调。这种误解难以发现和修复，且无法与新伙伴建立成功协调。

Conclusion: 至少需要三个相互交互的个体才能确保共享解释的出现。在这种条件下，人群能补偿缺乏共享信号使用观察的不足，确保共享解释的出现。

Abstract: The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it
facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through
communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We
investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new
vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals
do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of
the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study
communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their
environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and
artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations
while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always
converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents
interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful
misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using
misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination
with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately,
successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least
three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions
to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the
agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack
of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared
interpretations.

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that
expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs
often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong
answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a
fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship
between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we
investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We
begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through
expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning
expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence
trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for
unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last
input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems
linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we
propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression
monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these
boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without
sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by
cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.

Abstract: Decoding visual neural representations from Electroencephalography (EEG)
signals remains a formidable challenge due to their high-dimensional, noisy,

framework to enhance EEG-based visual decoding. Specifically, we introduce the
EEG Graph Transformer (EGT), a novel graph-based neural architecture that
simultaneously encodes spatial brain connectivity and temporal neural dynamics.
To mitigate high intra-subject variability, we propose Graph Archetype
Contrastive Learning (GAC), which learns subject-specific EEG graph archetypes
to improve feature consistency and class separability. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluations on the
Things-EEG dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms
prior state-of-the-art EEG decoding methods.The results underscore the
transformative potential of integrating graph-based learning with contrastive
objectives to enhance EEG-based brain decoding, paving the way for more

Conclusion: 符号学基础的多视角推理能有效提升大语言模型的逻辑推理性能，特别是在处理复杂语义和逻辑场景时表现出色。

Abstract: Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between
logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle
to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous
contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For
this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to
jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent
explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL),
while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that
incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle
boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic
simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce
RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94)
and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior
benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring
abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory
relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical
reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art
performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and
generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including
ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05%
average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our
semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical
performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

*Tung-Yu Wu,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出查询电路方法，直接在模型内部追踪特定输入到输出的信息流，提供更忠实和计算可访问的解释，相比现有方法能更好地解释模型对具体查询的响应原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要揭示全局能力电路，但无法解释为什么模型对特定输入查询产生特定输出。需要一种能直接追踪模型内部信息流、解释具体查询响应的本地化方法。

Method: 引入查询电路概念，开发基于采样的高效电路识别方法，使用归一化偏差忠实度(NDF)指标评估电路发现质量。

Result: 在多个基准测试(IOI、算术、MMLU、ARC)中发现模型内部存在极其稀疏的查询电路，仅覆盖1.3%模型连接就能恢复约60%的MMLU问题性能。

Conclusion: 查询电路为忠实、可扩展地解释语言模型如何处理单个输入提供了一种有效方法，是理解模型决策过程的重要进展。

Abstract: Explaining why a language model produces a particular output requires local,
input-level explanations. Existing methods uncover global capability circuits
(e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a
specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which
directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input
to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders),
query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more
faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits
practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation
Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit
recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable
to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based
methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully
describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and
ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model
that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a
circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of
performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step
towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process
individual inputs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了数据推理强度(DRI)指标来量化训练数据的逻辑推理复杂度，并基于此开发了重新认知优化策略，通过提升现有数据的推理强度而非增加数据量来增强LLM的逻辑推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注数据格式转换而忽视训练样本的内部推理复杂度，导致数据的推理潜力未被充分挖掘和利用。作者认为LLM逻辑推理性能同时受训练数据潜力和模型认知能力的约束。

Method: 引入数据推理强度(DRI)指标来量化样本的潜在逻辑推理复杂度，通过分解和聚合其逻辑结构；提出重新认知优化策略，系统性地增强训练数据的逻辑推理强度，使其更好地与LLM的逻辑推理边界对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法显著优于以数据为中心的策略，在性能和泛化能力上都有明显提升；在强化学习框架下进一步验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 优先考虑数据中的推理复杂度而非单纯的数据规模或表面形式，对于实现LLM的完整认知潜力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight the importance of
training data structure and quality in shaping reasoning behavior. However,
most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting
the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning
potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that
LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of
the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this
relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel
metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by
decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze
how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify
performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we
introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the
logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data
volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's
logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach
significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric
strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning
framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data
rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs'
full cognitive potential.

TL;DR: PhysicsMinions是一个用于物理奥林匹克竞赛的协同进化多智能体系统，通过三个工作室（视觉、逻辑、评审）的协作实现自我修正和推理，在HiPhO基准测试中取得了突破性成果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理奥林匹克竞赛作为物理智能的严格测试平台，需要复杂的推理和多模态理解，但现有AI方法多为单模型且开源模型难以达到金牌水平，因此需要开发更强大的系统。

Method: 提出协同进化多智能体系统，包含三个工作室：视觉工作室解析图表，逻辑工作室制定解决方案，评审工作室进行双阶段验证。通过迭代精炼循环实现自我修正。

Result: 在7个最新物理奥林匹克竞赛的HiPhO基准测试中：1）强泛化能力，提升开源和闭源模型性能；2）历史性突破，开源模型金牌数从1-2枚增至6枚；3）达到人类专家水平，在最新IPhO中排名第4（406名参赛者）。

Conclusion: PhysicsMinions为奥林匹克级别问题解决提供了可泛化的框架，有潜力扩展到其他学科领域。

Abstract: Physics is central to understanding and shaping the real world, and the
ability to solve physics problems is a key indicator of real-world physical
intelligence. Physics Olympiads, renowned as the crown of competitive physics,
provide a rigorous testbed requiring complex reasoning and deep multimodal
understanding, yet they remain largely underexplored in AI research. Existing
approaches are predominantly single-model based, and open-source MLLMs rarely
reach gold-medal-level performance. To address this gap, we propose
PhysicsMinions, a coevolutionary multi-agent system for Physics Olympiad. Its
architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret
diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform
dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement
loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic
Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground
truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads,
PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization:
it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different
sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii)
Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold
medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in
the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score
metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source
Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406
contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked
22nd). Generally, PhysicsMinions offers a generalizable framework for
Olympiad-level problem solving, with the potential to extend across
disciplines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的社会科学研究领域日益碎片化，需要系统性的分类框架来整合现有研究，明确证据标准，促进该领域的累积性进展。

Method: 采用文本嵌入、无监督聚类和主题建模的计算方法，对270项研究进行系统综述，构建计算分类法。

Result: 识别出三个有机形成的研究领域：LLM作为社会心智（关注认知、道德和偏见归因）、LLM社会（多智能体环境中的协调与制度）、LLM-人类互动（任务重塑与风险）。

Conclusion: 该分类法为碎片化领域提供了可复现的地图，澄清了不同分析层次的证据标准，突出了人工智能社会科学中累积性进展的机会。

Abstract: The social science of large language models (LLMs) examines how these systems
evoke mind attributions, interact with one another, and transform human
activity and institutions. We conducted a systematic review of 270 studies,
combining text embeddings, unsupervised clustering and topic modeling to build
a computational taxonomy. Three domains emerge organically across the reviewed
literature. LLM as Social Minds examines whether and when models display
behaviors that elicit attributions of cognition, morality and bias, while
addressing challenges such as test leakage and surface cues. LLM Societies
examines multi-agent settings where interaction protocols, architectures and
mechanism design shape coordination, norms, institutions and collective
epistemic processes. LLM-Human Interactions examines how LLMs reshape tasks,
learning, trust, work and governance, and how risks arise at the human-AI
interface. This taxonomy provides a reproducible map of a fragmented field,
clarifies evidentiary standards across levels of analysis, and highlights
opportunities for cumulative progress in the social science of artificial
intelligence.

TL;DR: RealUnify是一个专门评估多模态模型中理解与生成能力双向协同作用的基准，包含1000个人工标注实例，通过双评估协议揭示当前统一模型在能力协同方面仍存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要孤立评估理解和生成能力，无法确定统一模型是否能利用理解来增强生成，或通过生成模拟来促进更深层次的理解。

Method: 构建包含10个类别和32个子任务的RealUnify基准，围绕两个核心轴：理解增强生成（需要推理指导图像生成）和生成增强理解（需要心理模拟解决推理任务），采用双评估协议结合端到端评估和诊断性分步评估。

Result: 通过对12个领先统一模型和6个专业基线的评估，发现当前统一模型仍难以实现有效协同，表明仅靠架构统一是不够的。

Conclusion: 需要新的训练策略和归纳偏置来充分释放统一建模的潜力。

Abstract: The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.

Motivation: 解决传统心理测量方法成本高、扩展性差的问题，探索使用语义嵌入有效复制心理测量结构的可能性。

Method: 使用SQuID方法处理大语言模型嵌入，从修订版肖像价值观问卷(PVQ-RR)中恢复人类价值观结构，比较多种嵌入模型和评估指标。

Result: 嵌入方法解释了55%的维度相似性方差，多维尺度配置显示良好的因子一致性，结果基本符合理论基础。

Conclusion: 语义嵌入能有效复制传统心理测量结构，在成本、可扩展性和灵活性方面具有显著优势，为心理测量学和社会科学研究提供了补充方法。

Abstract: This study introduces "Survey and Questionnaire Item Embeddings
Differentials" (SQuID), a novel methodological approach that enables neural
network embeddings to effectively recover latent dimensions from psychometric
survey items. We demonstrate that embeddings derived from large language
models, when processed with SQuID, can recover the structure of human values
obtained from human rater judgments on the Revised Portrait Value Questionnaire
(PVQ-RR). Our experimental validation compares multiple embedding models across
a number of evaluation metrics. Unlike previous approaches, SQuID successfully
addresses the challenge of obtaining negative correlations between dimensions
without requiring domain-specific fine-tuning. Quantitative analysis reveals
that our embedding-based approach explains 55% of variance in
dimension-dimension similarities compared to human data. Multidimensional
scaling configurations from both types of data show fair factor congruence
coefficients and largely follow the underlying theory. These results
demonstrate that semantic embeddings can effectively replicate psychometric
structures previously established through extensive human surveys. The approach
offers substantial advantages in cost, scalability and flexibility while
maintaining comparable quality to traditional methods. Our findings have
significant implications for psychometrics and social science research,
providing a complementary methodology that could expand the scope of human
behavior and experience represented in measurement tools.

Motivation: 解决规范性理论与数据驱动方法之间难以定量仲裁和整合的问题，提供更自动化、可扩展的理论-数据整合方法。

Method: 使用自适应深度核高斯过程，在规范性理论生成的合成数据上进行元学习，获得理论驱动的核函数，用于构建概率模型。

Result: 在早期视觉系统应用中，相比传统数据驱动基线，提高了小鼠视网膜神经节细胞对自然场景刺激的响应预测准确性，并提供良好校准的不确定性估计和可解释表示。

Conclusion: 该框架为神经科学及其他领域提供了一种更通用、可扩展和自动化的方法，将理论知识整合到数据驱动的科学探究中。

Abstract: Normative and task-driven theories offer powerful top-down explanations for
biological systems, yet the goals of quantitatively arbitrating between
competing theories, and utilizing them as inductive biases to improve
data-driven fits of real biological datasets are prohibitively laborious, and
often impossible. To this end, we introduce a Bayesian meta-learning framework
designed to automatically convert raw functional predictions from normative
theories into tractable probabilistic models. We employ adaptive deep kernel
Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a
normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model
representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and
rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to
the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We
show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse
retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional
data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates
and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we
also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of
theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.
This work provides a more general, scalable, and automated approach for
integrating theoretical knowledge into data-driven scientific inquiry in
neuroscience and beyond.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS), leveraging the remarkable capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), show great potential in addressing complex tasks. In
this context, integrating MAS with legal tasks is a crucial step. While
previous studies have developed legal benchmarks for LLM agents, none are
specifically designed to consider the unique advantages of MAS, such as task
decomposition, agent specialization, and flexible training. In fact, the lack
of evaluation methods limits the potential of MAS in the legal domain. To
address this gap, we propose MASLegalBench, a legal benchmark tailored for MAS
and designed with a deductive reasoning approach. Our benchmark uses GDPR as
the application scenario, encompassing extensive background knowledge and
covering complex reasoning processes that effectively reflect the intricacies
of real-world legal situations. Furthermore, we manually design various
role-based MAS and conduct extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results highlight the strengths, limitations, and
potential areas for improvement of existing models and MAS architectures.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协同感知系统关键组件中存在的潜在风险和漏洞，希望研究结果能促进协同感知系统的设计和修复。

Abstract: With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication
technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the
potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a
single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software
systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying
fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions.
Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational
challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous
predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain
insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by
conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically
evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception
performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in
cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of
the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and
identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation
configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2)
Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion
schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher
frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not
robust against communication interference when running online. Our results
reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of
cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote
the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.

Abstract: The process of scientific discovery relies on an interplay of observations,
analysis, and hypothesis generation. Machine learning is increasingly being
adopted to address individual aspects of this process. However, it remains an
open challenge to fully automate the open-ended, heuristic, iterative loop
required to discover the laws of an unknown system by exploring it through
experiments and analysis, without tailoring the approach to the specifics of a
given task. Here, we introduce SciExplorer, an agent that leverages large
language model tool-use capabilities to enable free-form exploration of systems
without any domain-specific blueprints, and apply it to the exploration of
physical systems that are initially unknown to the agent. We test SciExplorer
on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution,
and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily
based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as
recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring
Hamiltonians from expectation values. The demonstrated effectiveness of this
setup opens the door towards similar scientific exploration in other domains,
without the need for finetuning or task-specific instructions.

<details>

Motivation: 现有RLVR方法对所有训练样本一视同仁，忽略了问题难度与模型能力之间的差异，导致学习效率低下和性能上限受限。

Method: CLPO利用模型自身表现进行实时难度评估，构建在线课程，通过自适应问题重构机制让模型作为自己的老师，多样化中等难度问题并简化挑战性问题。

Result: 在8个数学和通用推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，平均pass@1提升6.96%。

Conclusion: CLPO将静态训练过程转变为与模型能力共同演化的动态过程，能够更高效地训练具备更强推理能力的模型。

Abstract: Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has
become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training
samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty
relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy
leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered,
while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging
its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound
performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for
Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical
feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO
leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty
assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then
guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its
own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote
generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more
attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a
dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show
that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging
mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1
improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more
efficiently training more capable reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注或有限环境信息提示MLLM，成本高且扩展性差，任务覆盖范围有限。需要高质量、多样化的下游代理任务数据集。

Method: 两阶段流水线：探索阶段使用MLLM探索代理系统发现环境状态和功能；任务生成阶段利用探索轨迹和任务指导提示合成任务。

Conclusion: AutoPlay为训练MLLM代理提供了一种可扩展的方法，显著减少对人类标注的依赖，能够生成高质量的任务数据集。

Abstract: Post-Training Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to build interactive
agents holds promise across domains such as computer-use, web navigation, and
robotics. A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality
downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and
verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human
annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information,
which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited
coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task
generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover
possible interactions and current state information to synthesize
environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration
phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment
states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task
generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline
prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We
show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks

TL;DR: CEL是一种新型智能体架构，使用大型语言模型通过推理和规划来学习游戏，能够自主发现环境规则并制定有效策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习方法依赖大量经验且知识编码不透明，需要一种能够通过显式推理构建环境理解的更通用、可解释的智能体。

Method: CEL采用交互-反思循环：在每次游戏后分析完整轨迹，并行进行规则归纳（提炼环境动态模型）和策略总结（将经验转化为可操作的策略手册）。

Result: 在多种网格世界任务（扫雷、冰冻湖、推箱子）中，CEL能够从稀疏奖励中成功学习并掌握游戏，消融研究证实迭代过程对持续学习至关重要。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了构建更通用、可解释智能体的路径，这些智能体不仅有效行动，还通过显式推理构建对世界的透明且不断改进的模型。

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial agents that can learn to master complex
environments has led to remarkable successes, yet prevailing deep reinforcement
learning methods often rely on immense experience, encoding their knowledge
opaquely within neural network weights. We propose a different paradigm, one in
which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito,
ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language
Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its
environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state
with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of
interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete
trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where
it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and
Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable
strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e.,
Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent
successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their
rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies
confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work
demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only
act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world
through explicit reasoning on raw experience.

TL;DR: RL确实能让LLMs学习真正的新技能，通过组合现有技能来获得组合能力，这种能力可以泛化到更复杂的问题并迁移到不同任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RL在LLM后训练中是否真正教授新技能，还是仅仅激活现有能力，解决关于RL作用的持续争论。

Method: 开发合成框架，将技能定义为推断字符串转换函数输出的能力，研究LLM在RL训练后能否学习未见过的函数组合。

Result: 实验表明RL使LLM能够学习未见过的函数组合，这种组合能力可泛化到更复杂问题，并能迁移到不同任务。

Conclusion: RL能从根本上改变模型推理行为，建议先构建具有基本技能的基座模型，然后使用RL激励高级、可泛化的技能来解决复杂问题。

Abstract: Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing
ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in
LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with
RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue
that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies.
This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills
during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms
by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination
and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task
complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation.
Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string
transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g
prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen
compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability
generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions
unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that
compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target
task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target,
requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative
analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the
models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of
these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM
learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills,
then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex
problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话模型使用预标注的专家生成反馈进行对齐，但为了实现持续模型改进和多方面对齐，需要从自然人类交互中学习。

Method: 开发了两种互补方法：(1)RLHI与用户引导重写，基于用户的自然语言后续响应修订不满意输出；(2)RLHI与基于用户奖励，通过基于用户长期交互历史(个人资料)的奖励模型学习。

Result: 在WildChat对话数据上训练，两种RLHI变体在个性化和指令跟随方面都优于强基线，类似反馈还能提升推理基准性能。

Conclusion: 有机人类交互为个性化对齐提供了可扩展且有效的监督方式。

Abstract: We posit that to achieve continual model improvement and multifaceted
alignment, future models must learn from natural human interaction. Current
conversational models are aligned using pre-annotated, expert-generated human
feedback. In this work, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Human
Interaction (RLHI), a paradigm that learns directly from in-the-wild user
conversations. We develop two complementary methods: (1) RLHI with User-Guided
Rewrites, which revises unsatisfactory model outputs based on users'
natural-language follow-up responses, (2) RLHI with User-Based Rewards, which
learns via a reward model conditioned on knowledge of the user's long-term
interaction history (termed persona). Together, these methods link long-term
user personas to turn-level preferences via persona-conditioned preference
optimization. Trained on conversations derived from WildChat, both RLHI
variants outperform strong baselines in personalization and
instruction-following, and similar feedback enhances performance on reasoning
benchmarks. These results suggest organic human interaction offers scalable,
effective supervision for personalized alignment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过多视角文本描述增强视觉语言导航中类比推理的方法，以解决现有LLM-based VLN代理在视觉细节简化或抽象语义捕捉不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本LLM-based视觉语言导航代理要么将图像编码为文本场景描述（可能过度简化视觉细节），要么处理原始图像输入（可能无法捕捉高级推理所需的抽象语义），需要改进导航代理的上下文理解能力。

Method: 通过整合来自多个视角的文本描述，促进图像间的类比推理，利用基于文本的类比推理来增强全局场景理解和空间推理能力。

Result: 在R2R数据集上的实验表明，该方法在导航性能上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过多视角文本描述和类比推理，可以有效增强视觉语言导航代理的上下文理解和导航性能。

Abstract: Integrating large language models (LLMs) into embodied AI models is becoming
increasingly prevalent. However, existing zero-shot LLM-based
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual
scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw
image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for
high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's
contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple
perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging
text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene
understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.
We evaluate our approach on the R2R dataset, where our experiments demonstrate
significant improvements in navigation performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型智能体在持续任务流中无法从积累的交互历史中学习，导致重复过去的错误和浪费有价值的见解。

Method: ReasoningBank框架从智能体自我判断的成功和失败经验中提取推理策略，在测试时检索相关记忆指导交互，并将新学习整合回记忆库；MaTTS通过扩展智能体交互经验来加速和多样化学习过程。

Result: 在网络浏览和软件工程基准测试中，ReasoningBank持续优于存储原始轨迹或仅成功任务例程的现有记忆机制，提高了有效性和效率；MaTTS进一步放大了这些收益。

Conclusion: 这些发现确立了内存驱动经验扩展作为一个新的扩展维度，使智能体能够自我进化并自然产生涌现行为。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在需要串行视觉处理的简单推理任务中表现不佳，与人类存在显著差距，串行处理能力不足是当前VLMs的主要瓶颈


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么视觉语言模型在标准基准测试中表现良好，但在简单的视觉推理任务中却无法达到人类水平，假设串行视觉处理能力不足是关键因素

Method: 通过三个领域（几何推理、感知枚举、心理旋转）设计任务来改变串行处理需求，比较人类和VLM在不同串行处理负载下的表现，用人类反应时间作为串行处理负载的代理指标

Result: 在所有领域中，VLM准确率下降与人类反应时间增加（串行处理负载增加）呈强相关，当任务需要更多串行处理时，VLM与人类的表现差距显著扩大

Conclusion: 串行视觉推理能力的限制是区分当前VLMs与人类表现的基本瓶颈，支持了研究假设

Abstract: Why do Vision Language Models (VLMs), despite success on standard benchmarks,
often fail to match human performance on surprisingly simple visual reasoning
tasks? While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we
hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial
processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance
across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct
domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation.
Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors
such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and
transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a
consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with
increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As
tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts,
enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human
performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis,
indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a
fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.

TL;DR: UniAPL是一个统一的对齐学习框架，通过单阶段训练同时利用监督微调和强化学习数据，解决传统SFT+RL管道中的分布不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT后接RL的序列化训练存在关键分布不匹配问题：SFT使用静态专家数据，而策略演化时生成分布会漂移，使SFT知识变得脆弱。后续RL无法直接访问专家演示中的丰富知识，导致低效、无基础的更新。

Method: 将对齐重新定义为约束优化问题，提出UniAPL框架，通过单阶段统一训练目标，从混合的SFT和偏好数据批次中联合学习。在每个梯度步骤中，密集的专家演示直接基础和正则化在线探索。

Result: 在指令跟随任务上，UniAPL匹配或超越了强GRPO基线：Qwen3-0.6B提升5.77%（达到32B模型水平），Qwen3-4B提升3.75%，甚至超过了教师模型。响应长度和对数概率分布分析确认UniAPL输出更接近专家演示。

Conclusion: UniAPL通过统一训练框架有效解决了分布不匹配问题，实现了更强的性能和更好的行为对齐，输出行为更接近专家演示。

Abstract: Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment.
We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference
Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g.,
Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement
Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due
to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the
policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge
brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich,
ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient,
ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data
sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization
problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel
framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's.
UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning
from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense
expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration,
inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We
evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507
as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on
Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the
teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm
that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both
stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.

Method: 提出了J-Detector，一个轻量级透明的神经网络检测器，通过显式提取语言特征和LLM增强特征，将LLM法官的偏见与候选内容属性联系起来进行准确检测。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了J-Detector的有效性，其可解释性能够量化LLM法官的偏见，并验证了判断检测在实际场景中的实用性。

Conclusion: LLM生成的判断是可检测的，J-Detector提供了一种有效的检测方法，能够识别和量化LLM法官的偏见，在现实场景中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based judgments leverage powerful LLMs to
efficiently evaluate candidate content and provide judgment scores. However,
the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise
concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive
scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize
the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability
of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment
detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting
real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the
detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated
text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the
interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial
for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce
\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented
with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM
judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments
across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{J-Detector}
and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges.
Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated
judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Simplified proxy models are commonly used to represent architectural
structures, reducing storage requirements and enabling real-time rendering.
However, the geometric simplifications inherent in proxies result in a loss of
fine color and geometric details, making it essential for textures to
compensate for the loss. Preserving the rich texture information from the
original dense architectural reconstructions remains a daunting task,
particularly when working with unordered RGB photographs. We propose an
automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy
models at the texel level from an unordered collection of registered
photographs. Our approach establishes correspondences between texels on a UV
map and pixels in the input images, with each texel's color computed as a
weighted blend of associated pixel values. Using differentiable rendering, we
optimize blending parameters to ensure photometric and perspective consistency,
while maintaining seamless texture coherence. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse architectural
models and varying photographic conditions, enabling the creation of
high-quality textures that preserve visual fidelity and structural detail.

Conclusion: 该方法通过控制照明变化的时间过程，在显著降低功耗的同时保持了良好的感知质量。

Abstract: We introduce a gaze-tracking--free method to reduce OLED display power
consumption in VR with minimal perceptual impact. This technique exploits the
time course of chromatic adaptation, the human visual system's ability to
maintain stable color perception under changing illumination. To that end, we
propose a novel psychophysical paradigm that models how human adaptation state
changes with the scene illuminant. We exploit this model to compute an optimal
illuminant shift trajectory, controlling the rate and extent of illumination
change, to reduce display power under a given perceptual loss budget. Our
technique significantly improves the perceptual quality over prior work that
applies illumination shifts instantaneously. Our technique can also be combined
with prior work on luminance dimming to reduce display power by 31% with no
statistical loss of perceptual quality.

Abstract: We introduce a method that automatically and jointly updates both continuous
and discrete parameters of a compound lens design, to improve its performance
in terms of sharpness, speed, or both. Previous methods for compound lens
design use gradient-based optimization to update continuous parameters (e.g.,
curvature of individual lens elements) of a given lens topology, requiring
extensive expert intervention to realize topology changes. By contrast, our
method can additionally optimize discrete parameters such as number and type
(e.g., singlet or doublet) of lens elements. Our method achieves this
capability by combining gradient-based optimization with a tailored Markov
chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, using transdimensional mutation and
paraxial projection operations for efficient global exploration. We show
experimentally on a variety of lens design tasks that our method effectively
explores an expanded design space of compound lenses, producing better designs
than previous methods and pushing the envelope of speed-sharpness tradeoffs
achievable by automated lens design.

Abstract: In the field of 3D content generation, single image scene reconstruction
methods still struggle to simultaneously ensure the quality of individual
assets and the coherence of the overall scene in complex environments, while
texture editing techniques often fail to maintain both local continuity and
multi-view consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene,
which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both
single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot
manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information
from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then
jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update
object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent
and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background.
Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By
imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided
progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture
consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of
rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the
geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully
reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely
align with text prompts.

Conclusion: DFG-PCN通过自适应节点度分配和几何感知特征集成，有效提升了点云补全性能，特别是在几何复杂度不均匀的区域。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a vital task focused on reconstructing complete
point clouds and addressing the incompleteness caused by occlusion and limited
sensor resolution. Traditional methods relying on fixed local region
partitioning, such as k-nearest neighbors, which fail to account for the highly
uneven distribution of geometric complexity across different regions of a
shape. This limitation leads to inefficient representation and suboptimal
reconstruction, especially in areas with fine-grained details or structural
discontinuities. This paper proposes a point cloud completion framework called
Degree-Flexible Point Graph Completion Network (DFG-PCN). It adaptively assigns
node degrees using a detail-aware metric that combines feature variation and
curvature, focusing on structurally important regions. We further introduce a
geometry-aware graph integration module that uses Manhattan distance for edge
aggregation and detail-guided fusion of local and global features to enhance
representation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches.

Abstract: In the field of 3D point cloud generation, numerous 3D generative models have
demonstrated the ability to generate diverse and realistic 3D shapes. However,
the majority of these approaches struggle to generate controllable 3D point
cloud shapes that meet user-specific requirements, hindering the large-scale
application of 3D point cloud generation. To address the challenge of lacking
control in 3D point cloud generation, we are the first to propose controlling
the generation of point clouds by shape structures that comprise part
existences and part adjacency relationships. We manually annotate the adjacency
relationships between the segmented parts of point cloud shapes, thereby
constructing a StructureGraph representation. Based on this StructureGraph
representation, we introduce StrucADT, a novel structure-controllable point
cloud generation model, which consists of StructureGraphNet module to extract
structure-aware latent features, cCNF Prior module to learn the distribution of
the latent features controlled by the part adjacency, and Diffusion Transformer
module conditioned on the latent features and part adjacency to generate
structure-consistent point cloud shapes. Experimental results demonstrate that
our structure-controllable 3D point cloud generation method produces
high-quality and diverse point cloud shapes, enabling the generation of
controllable point clouds based on user-specified shape structures and
achieving state-of-the-art performance in controllable point cloud generation
on the ShapeNet dataset.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D形状描述方法依赖昂贵的体素表示或目标检测技术，但效果不佳。本文旨在解决这一挑战。

Result: 广泛的实验结果表明，Diff-3DCap能够达到与当前最先进方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: Diff-3DCap提供了一种有效的3D形状描述方法，通过扩散模型和视觉语言嵌入实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: The task of 3D shape captioning occupies a significant place within the
domain of computer graphics and has garnered considerable interest in recent
years. Traditional approaches to this challenge frequently depend on the
utilization of costly voxel representations or object detection techniques, yet
often fail to deliver satisfactory outcomes. To address the above challenges,
in this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected
views to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate
the captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous
diffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by
introducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation
during the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a
commitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained
visual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a
guiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier. Extensive
results of our experiments indicate that Diff-3DCap can achieve performance
comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: ReLumix是一个新颖的视频重光照框架，将重光照算法与时序合成解耦，使任何图像重光照技术都能无缝应用于视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频重光照方法缺乏灵活性，限制了用户只能使用特定的重光照模型。需要一种能够兼容各种图像重光照技术的通用视频重光照解决方案。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：(1)艺术家使用任意偏好的图像重光照技术重光照单个参考帧；(2)微调的稳定视频扩散模型将目标光照无缝传播到整个序列。引入门控交叉注意力机制和平滑特征融合，以及利用SVD强大运动先验的时间引导策略。

Conclusion: ReLumix提供了一个可扩展且通用的动态光照控制解决方案，显著提升了视频重光照的灵活性和质量。

Abstract: Controlling illumination during video post-production is a crucial yet
elusive goal in computational photography. Existing methods often lack
flexibility, restricting users to certain relighting models. This paper
introduces ReLumix, a novel framework that decouples the relighting algorithm
from temporal synthesis, thereby enabling any image relighting technique to be
seamlessly applied to video. Our approach reformulates video relighting into a
simple yet effective two-stage process: (1) an artist relights a single
reference frame using any preferred image-based technique (e.g., Diffusion
Models, physics-based renderers); and (2) a fine-tuned stable video diffusion
(SVD) model seamlessly propagates this target illumination throughout the
sequence. To ensure temporal coherence and prevent artifacts, we introduce a
gated cross-attention mechanism for smooth feature blending and a temporal
bootstrapping strategy that harnesses SVD's powerful motion priors. Although
trained on synthetic data, ReLumix shows competitive generalization to
real-world videos. The method demonstrates significant improvements in visual
fidelity, offering a scalable and versatile solution for dynamic lighting
control.

TL;DR: 提出了一种全栈解决方案，通过音频、语言和空间数据驱动生成具有交互时机和空间意图的对话手势，并在人形机器人上部署实现丰富的上下文感知物理交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖描述性语言生成动作或使用音频产生非交互手势，缺乏对交互时机和空间意图的表征，限制了对话手势生成在机器人和动画制作等领域的应用。

Method: 首先建立独特的数据采集方法同时捕获高精度人体运动和空间意图，然后开发由音频、语言和空间数据驱动的生成模型，并设计专用指标评估交互时机和空间准确性。

Result: 开发了完整的生成模型和评估指标，成功在人形机器人上部署了能够实现丰富上下文感知物理交互的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该全栈解决方案有效解决了对话手势生成中交互时机和空间意图表征不足的问题，显著提升了在机器人和动画制作等领域的适用性。

Abstract: The accompanying actions and gestures in dialogue are often closely linked to
interactions with the environment, such as looking toward the interlocutor or
using gestures to point to the described target at appropriate moments. Speech
and semantics guide the production of gestures by determining their timing
(WHEN) and style (HOW), while the spatial locations of interactive objects
dictate their directional execution (WHERE). Existing approaches either rely
solely on descriptive language to generate motions or utilize audio to produce
non-interactive gestures, thereby lacking the characterization of interactive
timing and spatial intent. This significantly limits the applicability of
conversational gesture generation, whether in robotics or in the fields of game
and animation production. To address this gap, we present a full-stack
solution. We first established a unique data collection method to
simultaneously capture high-precision human motion and spatial intent. We then
developed a generation model driven by audio, language, and spatial data,
alongside dedicated metrics for evaluating interaction timing and spatial
accuracy. Finally, we deployed the solution on a humanoid robot, enabling rich,
context-aware physical interactions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的点云可见性判定方法，将可见性问题建模为二分类任务，使用3D U-Net提取特征并结合MLP进行预测，在精度和效率上显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云作为3D数据的常用表示形式，其可见性判定由于稀疏性和缺乏显式连接而具有挑战性。传统方法如HPR在计算效率、噪声鲁棒性、处理凹区域和低密度点云方面存在局限。

Method: 使用3D U-Net提取与视角无关的点级特征，然后通过共享的多层感知器结合提取的特征和视角方向来预测点的可见性。网络使用从渲染3D模型生成的可见性标签进行端到端训练。

Result: 在精度和计算效率上显著优于HPR方法，在大型点云上实现高达126倍的加速。对噪声和不同点云密度具有鲁棒性，并能很好地泛化到未见过的形状。在ShapeNet、ABC数据集和真实世界数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在点云可见性判定方面取得了显著改进，并在点云可视化、表面重建、法线估计、阴影渲染和视点优化等多种应用中展示了其多功能性。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used representations of 3D data, but determining the
visibility of points from a given viewpoint remains a challenging problem due
to their sparse nature and lack of explicit connectivity. Traditional methods,
such as Hidden Point Removal (HPR), face limitations in computational
efficiency, robustness to noise, and handling concave regions or low-density
point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visibility
determination in point clouds by formulating it as a binary classification
task. The core of our network consists of a 3D U-Net that extracts
view-independent point-wise features and a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
that predicts point visibility using the extracted features and view direction
as inputs. The network is trained end-to-end with ground-truth visibility
labels generated from rendered 3D models. Our method significantly outperforms
HPR in both accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving up to 126 times
speedup on large point clouds. Additionally, our network demonstrates
robustness to noise and varying point cloud densities and generalizes well to
unseen shapes. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive
experiments on the ShapeNet, ABC Dataset and real-world datasets, showing
substantial improvements in visibility accuracy. We also demonstrate the
versatility of our method in various applications, including point cloud
visualization, surface reconstruction, normal estimation, shadow rendering, and
viewpoint optimization. Our code and models are available at

Motivation: 在广阔或动态变化的环境中实时确定可见性一直是计算机图形学的重要挑战，现有技术计算成本高且通常用于静态场景的预计算。

Method: 使用在体素化场景表示上运行的神经网络，结合稀疏卷积和3D体积保持交错进行数据压缩，并引入新颖的排斥可见性损失函数。

Conclusion: NeuralPVS为实时可见性计算提供了一个有前景的解决方案，具有增强的鲁棒性和对未见场景的泛化能力。

Abstract: Real-time visibility determination in expansive or dynamically changing
environments has long posed a significant challenge in computer graphics.
Existing techniques are computationally expensive and often applied as a
precomputation step on a static scene. We present NeuralPVS, the first
deep-learning approach for visibility computation that efficiently determines
from-region visibility in a large scene, running at approximately 100 Hz
processing with less than $1\%$ missing geometry. This approach is possible by
using a neural network operating on a voxelized representation of the scene.
The network's performance is achieved by combining sparse convolution with a 3D
volume-preserving interleaving for data compression. Moreover, we introduce a
novel repulsive visibility loss that can effectively guide the network to
converge to the correct data distribution. This loss provides enhanced
robustness and generalization to unseen scenes. Our results demonstrate that
NeuralPVS outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency, making it a promising solution for real-time visibility
computation.

TL;DR: Light-SQ是一个基于超二次曲面的优化框架，通过SDF雕刻、结构感知体积分解和自适应残差修剪等方法，实现高效、高保真且可编辑的3D形状抽象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在用户生成内容应用中，非专业用户依赖图像到3D生成模型创建3D资产。基于基元的形状抽象通过将高分辨率网格压缩为紧凑、可编辑的表示，为UGC场景提供有前景的解决方案。

Method: 1. SDF雕刻迭代更新目标符号距离场，减少基元重叠；2. 基于结构感知体积分解的块-重生长-填充策略，驱动基元放置；3. 基于SDF更新历史的自适应残差修剪，抑制过分割；4. 支持多尺度拟合以保留精细几何细节。

Result: 在扩展的3DGen-Prim基准测试中，Light-SQ能够对复杂生成几何实现高效、高保真且可编辑的形状抽象，推进3D UGC创建的可行性。

Conclusion: Light-SQ通过结构感知的优化方法，为UGC应用提供了有效的超二次曲面形状抽象解决方案，支持高质量重建和基元级编辑能力。

Abstract: In user-generated-content (UGC) applications, non-expert users often rely on
image-to-3D generative models to create 3D assets. In this context,
primitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios
by compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations.
Towards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be
structure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware
alignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel
superquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes
structure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to
iteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap
between primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by
structure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to
drive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on
SDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In
addition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement
to preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce
3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both
reconstruction quality and primitive-level editability. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Light-SQ enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable shape
abstraction with superquadrics for complex generated geometry, advancing the
feasibility of 3D UGC creation.

Motivation: 交互式字符图像编辑在细粒度控制、生成速度和视觉保真度之间存在固有权衡，现有方法难以平衡这些需求。

Method: 结合属性特定的概念滑块（用于隔离和操作面部特征、表情等属性）和StreamDiffusion采样管道，并提出了轻量级修复步骤来恢复细节纹理。

Conclusion: CharGen通过创新的概念滑块和修复步骤，成功解决了字符图像编辑中的速度-质量权衡问题，提供了高效且高质量的编辑体验。

Abstract: Interactive editing of character images with diffusion models remains
challenging due to the inherent trade-off between fine-grained control,
generation speed, and visual fidelity. We introduce CharGen, a
character-focused editor that combines attribute-specific Concept Sliders,
trained to isolate and manipulate attributes such as facial feature size,
expression, and decoration with the StreamDiffusion sampling pipeline for more
interactive performance. To counteract the loss of detail that often
accompanies accelerated sampling, we propose a lightweight Repair Step that
reinstates fine textures without compromising structural consistency.
Throughout extensive ablation studies and in comparison to open-source
InstructPix2Pix and closed-source Google Gemini, and a comprehensive user
study, CharGen achieves two-to-four-fold faster edit turnaround with precise
editing control and identity-consistent results. Project page:

*AmirHossein Zamani,Bruno Roy,Arianna Rampini*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督可微分框架，用于自动生成语义感知和可见性感知的UV映射，解决了传统手动UV映射的瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成模型依赖手动UV映射，这是一个耗时且需要专业技术的过程。现有自动方法缺乏语义感知（UV图表应在形状间对齐语义相似的3D部分）和可见性感知（切割缝应位于不太可能被看到的区域）这两个重要标准。

Method: 采用无监督可微分框架，结合语义感知和可见性感知目标。语义感知：将网格分割为语义3D部分，应用无监督学习的每部分UV参数化主干，聚合每部分图表为统一UV图集。可见性感知：使用环境光遮蔽作为曝光代理，通过可微分AO加权缝目标引导切割缝朝向遮挡区域。

Result: 通过定性和定量评估，与最先进方法相比，该方法生成的UV图集能更好地支持纹理生成，并减少可感知的缝伪影。

Conclusion: 该方法成功自动化了网格参数化过程，生成了语义和可见性感知的UV映射，显著改善了纹理生成质量并减少了视觉伪影。

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh
objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D
meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual
task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry
surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset
creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover,
existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria:
(1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts
across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in
regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate
the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable
framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic-
and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i)
segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned
per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts
into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion
(AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted
seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting
qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we
show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture
generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines.

Abstract: Designers craft and edit graphic designs in a layer representation, but
layer-based editing becomes impossible once composited into a raster image. In
this work, we propose LayerD, a method to decompose raster graphic designs into
layers for re-editable creative workflow. LayerD addresses the decomposition
task by iteratively extracting unoccluded foreground layers. We propose a
simple yet effective refinement approach taking advantage of the assumption
that layers often exhibit uniform appearance in graphic designs. As
decomposition is ill-posed and the ground-truth layer structure may not be
reliable, we develop a quality metric that addresses the difficulty. In
experiments, we show that LayerD successfully achieves high-quality
decomposition and outperforms baselines. We also demonstrate the use of LayerD
with state-of-the-art image generators and layer-based editing.
