On the basis of the model, we formulate a combined short-term and\nlong-term call-center staff scheduling problem aiming at maximizing the\ncustomer service level, which depends on the working performance of employees.\nWe then propose a memetic optimization algorithm combining global mutation and\nneighborhood search assisted by deep reinforcement learning to efficiently\nsolve this problem.

Nearly all recent work adopts a\ndeclarative paradigm for this problem: using an LLM to generate a specification\nof constraints between objects, then solving those constraints to produce the\nfinal layout. In contrast, we explore an alternative imperative paradigm, in\nwhich an LLM iteratively places objects, with each object's position and\norientation computed as a function of previously-placed objects. The imperative\napproach allows for a simpler scene specification language while also handling\na wider variety and larger complexity of scenes. We further improve the\nrobustness of our imperative scheme by developing an error correction mechanism\nthat iteratively improves the scene's validity while staying as close as\npossible to the original layout generated by the LLM. In forced-choice\nperceptual studies, participants preferred layouts generated by our imperative\napproach 82% and 94% of the time when compared against two declarative layout\ngeneration methods. We also present a simple, automated evaluation metric for\n3D scene layout generation that aligns well with human preferences."}

To fill this gap, we propose Shape-aware\nInertial Poser (SAIP), the first solution considering body shape differences in\nsparse inertial-based motion capture. Specifically, we decompose the sensor\nmeasurements related to shape and pose in order to effectively model their\njoint correlations. Firstly, we train a regression model to transfer the\nIMU-measured accelerations of a real body to match the template adult body\nmodel, compensating for the shape-related sensor measurements. Then, we can\neasily follow the state-of-the-art methods to estimate the full body motions of\nthe template-shaped body.

A key\nfeature of these estimation laws is that they accelerate the convergence of the\nsystem state, $\\mathit{x(t)}$, to the origin. We quantify this improvement by\nshowing that our estimation laws guarantee finite integrability of the\n$\\mathit{r}$-th root of the squared norm of the system state, i.e., \\(\n\\mathit{\\|x(t)\\|}_2^{2/\\mathit{r}} \\in \\mathcal{L}_1, \\) where $\\mathit{r} \\geq\n1$ is a pre-specified parameter that, for a broad class of systems, can be\nchosen arbitrarily large. In contrast, standard Lyapunov-based estimation laws\nonly guarantee integrability of $\\mathit{\\|x(t)\\|}_2^2$ (i.e., $\\mathit{r} =\n1$). We motivate our method by showing that, for large values of $r$, this\nguarantee serves as a sparsity-promoting mechanism in the time domain, meaning\nthat it penalizes prolonged signal duration and slow decay, thereby promoting\nfaster convergence of $\\mathit{x(t)}$. The proposed estimation laws do not rely\non time-varying or high adaptation gains and do not require persistent\nexcitation. Moreover, they can be applied to systems with matched and unmatched\nuncertainties, regardless of their dynamic structure, as long as a control\nLyapunov function (CLF) exists.

Such gestures cannot be derived\nfrom language input alone, which inherently lacks the visual meaning that is\noften carried autonomously by gestures. We therefore introduce a zero-shot\nsystem that generates gestures from a given language input and additionally is\ninformed by imagistic input, without manual annotation or human intervention.\nOur method integrates an image analysis pipeline that extracts key object\nproperties such as shape, symmetry, and alignment, together with a semantic\nmatching module that links these visual details to spoken text.

Conventional landmark-based methods face a\nfundamental trade-off between landmarks with high detectability but low\ndistinctiveness (e.g., poles) and those with high distinctiveness but difficult\nstable detection (e.g., local point cloud structures). This work addresses the\nchallenge of descriptively identifying a unique \"signature\" (local point cloud)\nby leveraging a detectable, high-precision \"anchor\" (like a pole). To solve\nthis, we propose a novel canonical representation, \"Pole-Image,\" as a hybrid\nmethod that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding\n3D structure. Pole-Image represents a pole-like landmark and its surrounding\nenvironment, detected from a LiDAR point cloud, as a 2D polar coordinate image\nwith the pole itself as the origin.

The\nkey advantage of pole landmarks is that \"detection\" is extremely easy. This\nease of detection allows the robot to easily track the same pole, enabling the\nautomatic and large-scale collection of diverse observational data (positive\npairs).

To collect\nthe dataset, we created 15 video stimuli and 7 text stimuli, depicting robots\nperforming varied household tasks. We then asked participants on Prolific what\nquestions they would want to ask the robot in each portrayed situation. In the\nfinal dataset, the most frequent categories are questions about task execution\ndetails (22.5%), the robot's capabilities (12.7%), and performance assessments\n(11.3%).

Moreover, we find that users\nwho identify as novices in robotics ask different questions than more\nexperienced users.

Recent embodied systems often adopt a\ndual-system paradigm, where System 2 handles high-level reasoning while System\n1 executes low-level control. In this work, we refer to System 2 as the\nembodied brain, emphasizing its role as the cognitive core for reasoning and\ndecision-making in manipulation tasks. Given this role, systematic evaluation\nof the embodied brain is essential. Yet existing benchmarks emphasize execution\nsuccess, or when targeting high-level reasoning, suffer from incomplete\ndimensions and limited task realism, offering only a partial picture of\ncognitive capability. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark\nthat systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as\nembodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation\npipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension,\nperception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure\nanalysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure\nrealism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects,\nand multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For\nplanning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework,\nMLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether\npredicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14\nMLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction\ncomprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained\naffordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a\ncomprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the\ndevelopment of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in\nhttps://robo-bench.github.io."}

The aim of our project is to develop a\nConvolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a\nphysical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to\ndetermine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was\ntrained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as\nwell as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean\nAverage Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of\nrandomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was\nchosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test\ndata set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the\nbasis of accuracy.

The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning\n(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the\nsignificant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder\nas well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of\ntraining strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in\nstrongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a\ncritical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through\ndiverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and\nsegmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's\npost-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on\nMLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual\nrepresentations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces\nstronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,\nboosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM.

The system combines semantic\nsegmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,\nscene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS\nor expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale\nfactor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into\naccurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane\ndetection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of\n14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a\ncolor-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a\nlightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time\nsemantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be\nreplaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model.

Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,\ntask-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and\nlimited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework\nfor video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically\ncombining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine\nlearning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video\nunderstanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a\nhigh-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms\na video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual\nencoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal\nSegmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the\ncontinuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.\nThese segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to\nidentify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By\nselecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging\nthe VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework\nautomatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.\nThis approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway\nfor zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content."}

To ensure imperceptibility, we employ\nspectral modulation rather than intensity modulation.

To answer this, we\nintroduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across\neight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for\nmost of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We\nfurther propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses\nVLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.\nBeyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics\nfrom videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most\nof the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a\nchallenging problem with large rooms to explore.

Code released under Apache 2.0 License", "summary": "Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and\nstructurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging\ndue to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns\n(NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This\nheterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and\npleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive\nCompact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer\nvariant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it\nfully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To\nenhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),\nwhich permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving\nanatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95\ncritically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the\nheterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest\nvalidation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)\nand specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial\nclassification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with\n2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results\nshow that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform\nscale in small-data medical imaging."}

In this work, we systematically investigate whether\nthese failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it\neffectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow\nlayers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably\nattend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the\nvisual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term\n``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building\non this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer\nevidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no\ntraining and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including\nLLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable\nevidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can\nbridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic\nunderstanding and reliability of VLMs."}

We also present robot algorithms\nfor manipulating leaves to take high-resolution indexable images of occluded\ndetails such as stem buds and the underside/topside of leaves. Results from\nexperiments suggest that Botany-Bot can segment leaves with 90.8% accuracy,\ndetect leaves with 86.2% accuracy, lift/push leaves with 77.9% accuracy, and\ntake detailed overside/underside images with 77.3% accuracy.
