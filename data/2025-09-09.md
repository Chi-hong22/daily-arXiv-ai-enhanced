### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Label Smoothing++是一种改进的标签正则化方法，通过为非目标类分配非零概率并考虑类间关系，解决了传统标签平滑破坏类间关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的标签平滑方法虽然能改善神经网络的泛化能力，但为所有非目标类分配相同的重要性，破坏了类间关系。需要一种既能缓解过拟合又能保持类间关系的方法。

Method: 提出Label Smoothing++策略，为目标类使用固定标签，同时让网络学习非目标类的标签，为非目标类分配非零概率并考虑它们的类间关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Label Smoothing++能够有效缓解过自信预测，同时促进类间关系和提升泛化能力。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++是一种有效的标签正则化方法，在保持传统标签平滑优点的同时，更好地处理了类间关系问题。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

### [2] [VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling Tool for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05317)
*Isac Holm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VILOD是一个可视化交互标注工具，通过t-SNE投影、不确定性热图和模型状态视图，使目标检测中的人机协作标注更加透明和有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测深度学习需要大量精确标注数据，但标注过程耗时昂贵。主动学习虽然能减少标注工作量，但缺乏透明度且可能忽略重要样本。

Method: 开发VILOD工具，整合t-SNE特征投影、不确定性热图和模型状态可视化，支持用户在交互式人机循环工作流中探索数据和实施多样本选择策略。

Result: 实证研究表明VILOD使模型状态和数据集特征更易解释，不同可视化引导标注策略能产生与自动化不确定性采样相当的检测性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为人机协作的目标检测标注工作流提供了更透明、可管理且可能更有效的工具和实证见解。

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

### [3] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应性知识蓄粉(AKD)框架，通过动态调整硬标简益损失和软标简蓄粉损失之间的平衡因子alpha，解决传统KD中固定alpha值的次优问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蓄粉把硬标损失和软标损失的平衡因子alpha设置为固定超参数，但这在训练过程中是次优的，因为最佳的相对重要性可能随着训练进行而变化。

Method: 1) 将alpha作为可学习参数在训练中自动优化 2) 提出一个公式来反映学生模型与教师模型之间的差距，动态计算alpha 3) 使用MLP+注意力机制的上下文感知模块(CAM)来自适应地重新调整类别级别的教师输出重量

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，以ResNet-50为教师模型、ResNet-18为学生模型的实验显示，该方法比固定权重KD基线方法获得更高的准确率，并产生更稳定的收敛性能。

Conclusion: 自适应性知识蓄粉框架通过动态调整硬标和软标损失之间的平衡，能够有效提升学生模型的性能和训练稳定性，为知识蓄粉领域提供了一种更灵活的训练策略。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

analysis, data augmentation, and brain-computer interface applications, with
substantial research and engineering significance.

### [5] [Approximating Condorcet Ordering for Vector-valued Mathematical Morphology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06577)
*Marcos Eduardo Valle,Santiago Velasco-Forero,Joao Batista Florindo,Gustavo Jesus Angulo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的方法学习近似Condorcet排序的简化排序，用于构建彩色图像的向量值形态学算子


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学形态学在向量值图像处理中缺乏统一的向量排序方法，需要找到最合适的排序方式来构建形态学算子

Method: 采用机器学习方法学习近似Condorcet排序的简化排序，Condorcet排序通过多个排序方式的投票机制确定最终排序

Result: 初步计算实验证实了学习简化映射在定义彩色图像向量值形态学算子方面的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为解决向量值数学形态学中的排序问题提供了有效的机器学习解决方案

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

### [6] [Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322)
*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种边中心网络度量（Forman-Ricci曲率、Ollivier-Ricci曲率和边介数中心性）在随机有线神经网络剪枝中的效果，发现计算效率更高的FRC能达到与ORC相当的剪枝性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索网络拓扑结构对深度学习的影响，研究不同连接模式如何影响学习效率和模型性能，同时为网络剪枝和优化提供基于边中心度量的框架。

Method: 使用三种网络生成器（ER、WS、BA模型）生成随机有线神经网络，在COVID-19胸部X射线图像分类任务上训练，然后采用FRC、ORC和EBC三种边中心度量进行选择性剪枝，保留重要突触。

Result: FRC基于剪枝能有效简化RWNNs，在保持与ORC相当性能的同时提供显著的计算优势。研究还分析了剪枝后网络的结构特性，包括模块化和全局效率的权衡。

Conclusion: 计算效率更高的Forman-Ricci曲率（FRC）可以达到与Ollivier-Ricci曲率（ORC）相当的剪枝效果，为神经网络压缩提供了更高效的选择。

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [8] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM框架通过合成数据集生成和两阶段重新思考机制，有效提升模型在域偏移下的目标识别鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署中，目标识别模型面临多种域偏移（图像统计变化、姿态变化、遮挡、类别混淆）导致准确率严重下降，需要提高模型鲁棒性

Method: 1) 构建合成数据集生成管道，生成包含4种线索（边界框、类别名、目标级描述、场景级描述）的图像标注；2) 对Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct进行参数高效监督调优；3) 推理时执行两阶段重新思考：先输出4种线索，再将其作为证据迭代修正

Result: 在隔离单个域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM始终超越强基线方法

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自批判循环的结合，是实现可靠且可迁移视觉理解的有前途路径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

*Diwen Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用智能手机和视频分析技术，开发了一种成本效益高的羽毛球冲击速度测量系统，为普通运动员提供专业级性能分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动性能测量技术成本高、复杂且难以普及，低成本方案缺乏，特别是在羽毛球运动中。

Method: 采用自定义YOLOv5模型进行羽毛球检测，结合卡尔曼滤波算法进行稳健轨迹跟踪，通过视频基于动力学的速度估算方法进行时空缩放。

Result: 开发出了一个直观易用的移动应用程序，能够自动从标准视频中计算羽毛球速度。

Conclusion: 该系统普及了高级性能分析的访问，使得各级别的羽毛球运动员都能够分析和改进自己的游戏技术。

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

*Zebo Xu,Shaoyun Yu,Mark Torrance,Guido Nottbusch,Nan Zhao,Zhenguang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了中文手写数据库和开源工具包，通过大规模实验发现词汇因素（形、音、义）在字符、部首和笔画不同层次对手写准备和执行的层级衰减影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中文手写研究中语言组件调控机制不清和缺乏细粒度数据批量处理工具的问题。

Method: 构建大规模手写数据库（42名受试者手写1200字符），升级OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具包，采用多重回归分析手写准备和执行参数。

Result: 形态因素在字符、部首和笔画层面都影响手写准备和执行；音义因素在所有三个层次影响执行；词汇效应呈现层级衰减特征（字符层 > 部首层 > 笔画层）。

Conclusion: 部首和笔画层面的手写准备和执行与语言组件密切相关，该数据库和工具包为语言心理和神经语言学研究提供了价值资源。

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

TL;DR: 提出了InterAct数据集和基于扩散的方法，用于捕捉两人在日常生活场景中的动态交互行为，包括语音驱动的身体动作和面部表情生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有工作大多只关注单人或静态交互的局限，需要捕捉更真实、动态、语义一致的长时间双人交互行为。

Method: 构建包含241个运动序列的多模态InterAct数据集，提出分层回归身体动作的扩散方法，并设计新颖的精调机制提升嘴唇准确性。

Result: 创建了包含多样化复杂动作和长期交互模式的数据集，提出的方法能够从语音输入有效估计两人的交互式面部表情和身体动作。

Conclusion: InterAct数据集填补了双人动态交互研究的空白，提出的扩散方法为语音驱动的交互行为生成提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域进一步发展。

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动态图神经网络和LSTM的混合模型，用于预测跌倒事件，通过解耦运动预测和步态分类任务实现高精度早期跌倒检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注跌倒检测，但跌倒发生前的预测以及稳定状态与即将跌倒之间的瞬态状态分析尚未得到充分探索

Method: 使用混合模型：DGNN作为分类器区分稳定、瞬态和跌倒三种步态状态，LSTM网络预测后续时间步的人类运动，实现早期跌倒检测

Result: 在OUMVLP-Pose和URFD数据集上验证，相比仅使用DGNN的模型和文献中的模型，在预测误差和识别准确率方面表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 解耦预测和分类任务相比统一处理方法能提升性能，同时允许监测瞬态状态，为高级辅助系统功能增强提供有价值见解

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Conclusion: 该模型能够有效地进行多类别葱植物疾病和寝虫分类，为精准农业提供了可靠的技术支撑

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

Method: 提出Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF)框架，通过显式建模源和目标速度场差异，并引入时间相关偏移项来推动噪声潜在向量更接近目标轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明DVRF在编辑质量、保真度和可控性方面表现优异，无需架构修改，高效且广泛适用于文本到图像编辑任务。

Conclusion: DVRF成功弥合了基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化，为FlowEdit等方法提供了理论解释，实现了高质量的无反演图像编辑。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

Conclusion: 频率感知优化对于实现真实图像表示至关重要，该方法在内容创作、神经渲染和医学成像等领域具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

TL;DR: 研究分析了YOLOv8和YOLOv10在资源受限环境中的层冻结策略，发现最佳冻结策略依赖于数据特性，能节省28%的GPU内存消耗并在某些情况下超越全量微调的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将YOLO架构部署到资源受限环境如无人机时，需要高效转移学习。虽然层冻结是常用技术，但对于当代YOLOv8和YOLOv10架构中各种冻结配置的具体影响以及与数据集特征、训练动态的交互作用仍未得到深入研究。

Method: 系统研究了YOLOv8和YOLOv10变体的多种冻结配置，使用四个具有挑战性的关键基础设施监控数据集。方法包括梯度行为分析（L2范数）和视觉解释（Grad-CAM），以提供不同冻结策略下训练动态的深入见解。

Result: 结果显示不存在通用的最佳冻结策略，而是依赖于数据特性。冻结背骨网络有效保留通用特征，而浅层冻结更适合处理极端类别不平衡。这些配置与全量微调相比能节省至28%的GPU内存消耗，并在某些情况下达到更高的mAP@50分数。梯度分析证实了这些发现，显示中等冻结模型具有明显的收敛模式。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了关于选择冻结策略的实证研究结果和实践指南，为资源受限场景中的物体检测提供了一种平衡的、基于证据的转移学习方法。

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

TL;DR: 通过随机遮掩事件流和解耦全波注意力机制，网络能够处理不完整事件数据并实现稳健的运动去模糊效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了事件流的本质不完整性问题，这是由于DVS伪器效应效应与噪声间的批轴所导致的，影响了运动先验知识的完整性和去模糊效果

Method: 1）提出稳健性导向的批动策略(RPS)，通过随机遮掩事件使网络面对不完整模式 2）设计解耦全波注意力(OmniAttention)，显式建模内部运动、运动间和跨模态相关性 3）两个交互模块增强模糊图像中的运动敏感区域并向事件表征注入语义上下文

Conclusion: 通过处理事件流的本质不完整性，该方法能够实现更稳健和有效的运动去模糊，为事件相机在运动图像处理领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Motivation: 解决现有PTQ方法迭代参数更新导致的计算复杂度高、资源开销大问题，限制了在边缘计算和实时推理场景中的应用

Method: 基于参数敏感性分析，优先量化高敏感性参数，利用未量化低敏感性参数补偿量化误差；通过列向聚类和行并行量化框架，减少计算复杂度

Result: 在ResNet-50和YOLOv5s上实现了20-200倍量化速度提升，平均准确性损失低于0.3%

Conclusion: 该方法有效场散了量化效率和准确性之间的争议，适用于资源受限的边缘计算环境

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Conclusion: 该框架能够以单张照片为输入生成高质量、高效率的可控制虚拟人物，为一元3D头部重建领域提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: MFFI数据集通过多维度增强策略有效解决了现有Deepfake检测数据集的局限性，为真实世界场景下的人脸伪造检测提供了更全面和实用的基准数据集。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

TL;DR: VideoGraph提出了一种语言引导的时空图建模方法，通过递归图网络处理视频摘要任务，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注帧间的全局时序建模，但忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）与视频主要内容的关系。语言引导的视频摘要需要全面理解复杂真实世界视频的语言语义

Method: 将视频摘要视为语言引导的时空图建模问题，构建空间图（对象节点）和时间图（帧节点），通过图边表示节点间的语义关系，融入语言查询使节点包含语义知识，采用递归策略精化图结构

Result: 在多个通用和查询聚焦的视频摘要基准测试中，VideoGraph在监督和无监督方式下均达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 通过语言引导的时空图建模和递归优化策略，VideoGraph能够有效捕捉视频中的语义关系，显著提升视频摘要的质量和准确性

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有自监督表征学习方法主要关注全局表征，无法满足需要空间精确性和细粒度细节的密集预测任务需求

Method: 提出基于预训练表征的自监督学习框架，通过Patch-level Kernel Alignment(PaKA)对齐育人模型和学生模型的密集特征分布，并研究适合密集表征学习的增强策略

Result: 在多个密集视觉指标上达到最先进水平

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效将现有语义知识转移到密集特征空间，为密集预测任务提供更好的表征学习方案

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA是一种无需训练的双层剪枝方法，利用局部和全局信息进行智能token选择，在VLA模型上实现显著加速且几乎不损失成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型剪枝方法仅使用当前动作的局部信息，忽略了历史动作的全局上下文，导致成功率下降超过20%且加速效果有限。研究发现连续动作间存在高度相似性

Method: 1) 动作级静态剪枝：使用全局历史和局部上下文减少每动作的视觉token；2) 层级动态剪枝：基于层级重要性剪枝token；3) 轻量级动作感知控制器：按速度分类动作为粗/细粒度，调整剪枝强度

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，SpecPrune-VLA相比OpenVLA-OFT在NVIDIA A800上实现1.46倍加速，在NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090上实现1.57倍加速，成功率损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 结合局部和全局信息的智能token选择方法能有效提升VLA模型的推理速度，同时保持性能，为解决计算密集型模型的加速问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

TL;DR: 提出Subspace Mapping (SuMa)方法，专门用于有效擦除文本到图像扩散模型中的狭窄概念（如版权角色、名人），同时保持图像质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法无法同时实现鲁棒性和有效性，特别是在处理狭窄概念时存在困难，这些概念与邻近非目标概念距离很近，需要更精细的操作

Method: SuMa首先推导出表示要擦除概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化两个子空间之间距离的参考子空间来中和目标概念

Result: 在四个任务（子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除和实例擦除）上的实验表明，SuMa在图像质量上与注重有效性的方法相当，在完整性方面与注重完整性的方法结果相当

Conclusion: SuMa方法成功实现了对狭窄概念的鲁棒擦除，同时保持了良好的图像质量，为解决版权和法律问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

Conclusion: 自监督学习能够有效提取高光谱图像中的植被特性信息，构建的神经网络嵌入表示在下游任务中具有更好的性能表现，为精准农业中的高光谱图像分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties

demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

Motivation: 现有角色编辑方法在简单提示下表现良好，但在面对包含多层语义、时间逻辑和复杂上下文关系的长文本叙事时，往往会出现编辑能力下降、语义理解偏差和身份一致性崩溃的问题。

Method: 通过PerceiverAttention的精细分解、引入ID损失和与扩散模型的联合动态训练，以及集成模块的离线融合策略，在最小数据润滑下实现可编辑性注入。

Result: 在复杂叙事环境中实现了深度多层级语义编辑，同时保持身份一致性，满足了长提示词和高质量图像生成的需求，在IBench评估中取得了优异结果。

Conclusion: EditIDv2成功解决了长文本叙事场景下的角色编辑挑战，通过创新的技术方法在最小数据需求下实现了高质量的身份一致性编辑效果。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

Motivation: 现有场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，难以有效整合常识知识，限制了长期预测的鲁棒性。需要显式利用常识知识来更好地理解场景中的对象、概念和关系。

Method: 采用对象导向的两阶段方法(OOTSM)：1) 使用大语言模型预测物体的出现和消失；2) 生成详细的人-物关系。将场景图预测任务解耦为纯文本的LSGA任务。

Result: 在Action Genome基准测试中，短期mean-Recall(@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall(@50)大幅提升21.9%，达到state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: 提出的语言场景图预测方法有效整合了常识知识，显著提升了长期预测能力，证明了纯文本方法在场景理解任务中的独立价值。

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

Motivation: 受高能物理中堆积噪声抑制策略的启发，希望将物理先验（守恒性、局部性、隔离性）嵌入神经网络架构，提升图像去噪在强噪声下的鲁棒性

Method: 提出层次化的PU-inspired去噪器：带守恒约束的残差CNN、高斯噪声变体，以及将物理先验集成到UNet骨干的WIPUNet网络

Result: 在CIFAR-10和BSD500数据集上，PU-inspired CNN与标准基线相当，而WIPUNet在高噪声水平下表现出逐渐扩大的优势，证明物理启发的先验在强噪声下提供稳定性

Conclusion: 物理启发的归纳偏置可以模块化地转化为神经网络约束，集成到UNet等架构中，在不依赖复杂SOTA模型的情况下显著提升高噪声环境下的去噪鲁棒性

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

TL;DR: CAMVR框架通过视觉-文本上下文记忆单元和自适应视觉聚焦机制，解决了多轮视觉对话中的上下文丢失和幻觉问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言大模型在单轮任务表现优秀，但在需要深度上下文理解和复杂视觉推理的多轮交互中存在推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉等挑战

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含两个关键创新：1) Visual-Textual Context Memory Unit (VCMU) - 动态读写记忆网络，存储管理视觉特征和文本语义表示；2) Adaptive Visual Focus Guidance (AVFG) - 利用VCMU上下文动态调整视觉编码器注意力到相关图像区域

Result: 在VisDial、A-OKVQA和MTIF等多个挑战性数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAMVR始终达到最先进的性能

Conclusion: CAMVR框架通过创新的记忆管理和注意力机制，有效提升了多轮视觉-文本推理的连贯性和准确性

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

TL;DR: MeshMetrics是一个基于网格的框架，用于更精确计算基于距离的分割评估指标，解决了传统网格方法中的实现陷阱和离散化伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割研究中存在可重复性危机，性能评估中指标实现可靠性问题被忽视，基于距离的指标在不同开源工具中存在显著差异（如Hausdorff距离差异超过100mm）。

Method: 提出MeshMetrics框架，采用基于网格的方法而非传统的基于网格的方法，通过理论分析和实证验证来精确计算基于距离的评估指标。

Result: MeshMetrics比现有工具具有更高的准确性和精度，受离散化伪影（如距离量化）的影响显著减小。

Conclusion: MeshMetrics作为开源Python包发布，为图像分割评估提供了更可靠的基于距离的指标计算方法，解决了现有工具中的实现不一致问题。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

TL;DR: LVLM-VAR是一个基于预训练视觉-语言大模型的新型视频动作识别框架，通过将视频转换为语义动作标记，结合自然语言指令进行动作分类和语义推理，在准确性和可解释性方面都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理多样化视频数据时，往往难以实现深度语义理解、复杂上下文信息和细粒度区分。受到大语言模型强大能力的启发，本文旨在利用预训练视觉-语言大模型来解决视频动作识别中的这些挑战。

Method: 提出Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST)模块，将原始视频序列转换为离散的、语义和时间一致的语义动作标记，构建可被LVLM理解的"动作叙述"。然后使用LoRA微调的LVLM（如LLaVA-13B）处理这些标记和自然语言指令，进行动作分类和语义推理。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进或极具竞争力的性能：NTU RGB+D X-Sub达到94.1%，NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set达到90.0%。同时通过生成自然语言解释显著提升了模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR框架成功地将预训练视觉-语言大模型应用于视频动作识别，不仅在准确性方面取得显著提升，还大大增强了模型的可解释性，为视频理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

Conclusion: 通过融合几何结构信息和语义信息，JRN-Geo网络能够有效处理跨视角地理定位中的视角差异问题，提升定位精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: LiDAR-BIND-T扩展了多模态融合框架，通过时间一致性机制提升雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换的时空连贯性，显著改善SLAM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多传感器融合中时间不一致性问题，提升下游SLAM任务的鲁棒性和性能。

Method: 引入三种时间一致性机制：时间嵌入相似性对齐、运动对齐变换损失、窗口时间融合模块，并更新模型架构以保持空间结构。

Result: 在雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换任务中表现出更好的时空连贯性，降低了绝对轨迹误差，提高了Cartographer SLAM的占用地图精度。

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T在保持即插即用多模态融合的同时，显著增强了时间稳定性，为下游SLAM应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Motivation: 为了解决多相机系统中视觉信息集成效率低、一致性差的问题，以及相机帧与全景模型帧不对齐导致的三角测量不一致问题。

Method: 提出全景视觉特征模型统一多相机观测，采用外参补偿方法解决帧不对齐问题，并基于因子图实现紧耦合的LiDAR-视觉-惯性系统集成。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，全景视觉特征模型提高了多相机约束的质量和一致性，相比现有系统具有更高的精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Multi-LVI-SAM框架通过全景建模和外参补偿有效解决了多相机系统的集成挑战，实现了高精度和鲁棒的状态估计。

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于水平变化逆问题的距离自适应单图超分辨框架，通过深度条件卷积内核和学习的距离适应性正则化项来处理真实影像中的空间变化降级效应，在多个标准数据集上实现了独创性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的单图超分辨方法假设空间不变的降级模型，但真实影像系统存在大气散射、景深变化和透视扭曲等距离依赖效应，需要空间适应性重建策略来获得最佳性能。

Method: 提出一种严格的变分框架，将超分辨形式化为水平变化逆问题，通过深度条件卷积内核的级联殊归块实现离散梯度流动力学，确保收敛到理论能量函数的稳定点，同时包含动态调整平滑性约束的学习距离适应性正则化项。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上进行了全面评估，在KITTI室外场景中在2倍和4倍缩放比下分别达到了36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721的PSNR/SSIM指标，超过现有方法0.44dB和0.36dB。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了第一个理论基础坚实的距离自适应超分辨框架，在深度变化场景中实现了显著改进，同时在传统标准测试集上保持了竞争性能。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS通过分层推理框架有效解决了语言与动态视觉内容对齐的挑战，无需训练即可实现准确的视频对象分割。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

Motivation: 慢性疾病需要严格的药物依从性来预防疾病进展和降低死亡率，但患者行为、医疗成本等因素很容易影响依从性。需要一种能够通过视频分析来监测药物依从情况的技术方案。

Abstract: Chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV-AIDS,
epilepsy, and tuberculosis, necessitate rigorous adherence to medication to
avert disease progression, manage symptoms, and decrease mortality rates.
Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior,
caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare
infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based
multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question
answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We
employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)
medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to
fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a
detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and
ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual
features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water
intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in
captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic
representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results
indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute
improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

Conclusion: 成功开发了第一个基于伪图像表示的两阶段3D检测框架，充分利用了PointPillars的效率优势，同时通过创新的结构设计克服了其性能限制，在3D物体检测领域实现了速度与准确性的良好抑衡

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a

and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，前向投影方法生成稀疏BEV特征，反向投影方法存在深度模糊问题导致误报，需要解决相机-雷达融合中的这些限制

Method: 使用反向投影技术，结合图像密集但不准确的深度分布与雷达稀疏但精确的深度信息，引入包含雷达上下文信息的空间交叉注意力机制

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实现62.4% NDS和54.0% mAP，在基于反向投影的相机-雷达融合方法中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: CRAB模型通过有效融合相机和雷达信息，成功解决了深度模糊问题，显著提升了3D目标检测性能

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

TL;DR: 提出了两种注意力引导的自编码器架构用于医疗设备制造中的深度异常检测，分别使用结构相似性异常评分和特征距离方法，在小型不平衡数据集上实现了高精度实时缺陷检测和监管合规监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设备制造中的自动化视觉检测面临小样本、不平衡数据、高分辨率图像和严格监管要求的挑战，需要开发既能准确检测缺陷又能满足监管要求的深度异常检测方法。

Method: 提出了两种注意力引导的自编码器架构：第一种使用4-MS-SSIM结构相似性异常评分进行轻量级实时缺陷检测；第二种使用马氏距离在降维潜在特征上进行特征距离异常评分，用于监督监控。

Result: 第一种方法在仅有10%缺陷样本的测试集上达到ACC 0.903（无监督阈值）和0.931（有监督阈值）；第二种方法在有监督阈值下达到ACC 0.722，两种方法均优于重新实现的基线方法。

Conclusion: 这两种方法提供了互补能力：第一种支持可靠的在线检测，第二种支持可扩展的生产后监控和监管合规监测，为在受监管制造环境中部署深度异常检测提供了实用途径，符合欧盟AI法案对高风险AI系统的要求。

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM是SAM的概率扩展版本，通过引入潜在变量空间和变分训练目标，能够生成反映人类标注变异性的多样化分割掩码，特别适用于医学图像中存在标注不确定性的场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可提示分割模型（如SAM）是确定性的，只能为每个提示生成单一分割结果，无法捕捉真实世界任务中固有的模糊性，这在医学影像中尤为明显，因为可能存在多个合理的分割结果。

Method: 在SAM框架中集成先验网络和后验网络，通过潜在变量空间调节提示嵌入，使用变分目标进行训练，学习生成多样化的分割掩码。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI肺结节数据集上评估，Probabilistic SAM能够产生与专家分歧一致的多样化输出，在不确定性感知指标上优于现有概率基线方法。

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM成功扩展了SAM的概率能力，能够有效处理医学图像分割中的不确定性，为不确定性感知的分割任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

Motivation: 沙尘暴对健康和能见度造成害处，需要从卫星图像中进行快速检测

Method: 使用NASA Terra和Aqua卫星MODIS仪器的36个波段图像，构建3D卷积神经网络，通过多谱和空间特征区分沙尘与云层、地表物体

Result: 在17个独立MODIS场景中达到约0.92的准确度，均方误差为0.014，核心区域检测结果一致性高

Conclusion: 多谱和空间聚合学习能够提供及时的全球沙尘预警，使用更大输入窗口或注意力机制模型可以进一步提高边缘检测精度

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists
represent more than half of global traffic deaths, yet their detection remains
challenging in poor lighting, adverse weather, and unbalanced data sets. This
paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal

BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light
augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments
show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy
and efficiency, while class-weighted losses enhance recall for rare VRUs.
Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and
RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of
multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.

Motivation: 颈动脉组织分割对心血管疾病研究和诊断至关重要，但标注数据稀缺限制了深度学习模型的发展。需要系统评估现有模型在这种低数据场景下的表现。

Method: 系统评估多种状态流行的深度学习分割模型，包括CNN（U-Net、DeepLabV3+）、视觉Transformer（SegFormer）和基础模型（SAM、MedSAM、MedSAM+UNet），使用贝叶斯搜索进行深度调参。

Result: 模型性能对数据分割极其敏感，小的性能差异更多是由统计噪声驱动，而非算法真正优势。标准测试方法在低数据临床环境中存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 在标注数据稀缺的心血管疾病研究领域，传统的模型性能排名方法存在局限性，性能结果不能真实反映模型的临床效用价值，需要重新考虑评估方法。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

Motivation: 现有方法通过直接拼接处理图像对，无法充分建模时序相关性和空间语义变化，限制了变化理解中的视觉-语义对齐效果。

Method: 提出BTCChat模型，包含Change Extraction模块来捕捉时序特征和空间语义变化，以及Prompt Augmentation机制通过添加上下文线索来增强对空间细节的关注。

Result: 实验结果表明，BTCChat在变化描述和视觉问答任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BTCChat通过创新的模块设计有效解决了双时序图像分析中的时序建模和语义对齐问题，为卫星图像变化分析提供了强有力的工具。

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了位置元数据对海底图像自监督学习的影响，发现位置正则化能持续提升CNN和ViT模型的分类性能，特别是在低维隐藏表征中效果更为显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过高速解释机器人采集的海底视觉图像可以提高海洋监测和探索的效率。虽然最近的研究已经说明位置元数据可以增强自监督学习，但其在不同的SSL策略、模型和海底图像数据集中的好处仍然很少被探索。

Method: 这项研究在三个多样的海底图像数据集上评估了位置基于正则化对六个最先进的SSL框架的影响，这些框架包括卷积神经网络(CNN)和视觉Transformer(ViT)模型，具有不同的隐藏空间维度。

Result: 评估结果显示，位置正则化一贯地提高了下游分类性能，超过了标准SSL。CNN的平均F1分数提高了$4.9 \pm 4.0%$，ViT的平均F1分数提高了$6.3 \pm 8.9%$。位置正则化的SSL在高维和低维隐藏表征不同情况下都显示出性能提升。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了位置元数据对SSL正则化的价值，特别是在使用低维隐藏表征时，并证明了高维ViT在海底图像分析中的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

Motivation: 现有肌肉骨骼风险评估方法大多依赖单一数据类型，无法在复杂环境中可靠评估风险，需要开发能够融合多模态数据的解决方案。

Method: 提出ViSK-GAT框架，结合残差块和轻量级Transformer块，包含细粒度注意力模块（FGAM）和多模态几何对应模块（MGCM），通过交叉注意力实现视觉和骨骼输入的精确跨模态特征细化。

Result: 模型在验证集和测试集上分别达到93.55%和93.89%的准确率，精确率93.86%，F1分数93.85%，各项指标均显著优于9个流行的迁移学习骨干网络。

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT推动了人工智能在肌肉骨骼风险分类中的应用，能够实现有效的早期干预，为运动员健康保护提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

Conclusion: 该框架具有优秀的聚类能力和强壁性，适合生成调查数据摘要和支持长期持续自主海洋探索中的信息化路径规划

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法注重像素级重建，但新兴应用更关注语义保存和跨数据分布的鲁棒性，需要先进的语义压缩范式

Method: 利用多模态基础模型的零样本能力，提出基于CLIP模型的语义压缩方法，将CLIP特征嵌入压缩为最小比特同时保持跨任务语义信息

Result: 在基准数据集上保持语义完整性，平均比特率约2-3×10⁻³ bpp，比主流图像压缩方法所需比特率少95%以上

Conclusion: 该方法在极端压缩下仍能保持跨数据分布和下游任务的零样本鲁棒性，为语义压缩提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法使视觉语言预训练模型成为现实世界应用中更可行的解决方案，通过分层视觉信息和动态提示机制显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way

Result: CPS方法能够生成更清晰的图像，提高奖励模型的准确性，从而促进强化学习优化器如Flow-GRPO和Dance-GRPO更快更稳定地收敛。

Conclusion: 该研究为Flow Matching模型的强化学习应用提供了一种更有效的采样方法，解决了SDE方法的噪声问题，提升了生成质量和学习效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双交互融合模块(DIFM)和多尺度边界损失，通过交叉注意力机制融合原始和增强医学图像的特征，提升分割精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中，噪声、模糊和低对比度等问题影响诊断准确性。传统图像增强技术可能改变关键信息，而特征拼接等融合方法无法充分利用原始和增强图像的优势

Method: 使用双向交叉注意力机制同时关注不同图像的对应空间信息，通过全局空间注意力细化互补特征。引入基于梯度提取的多尺度边界损失来提升边界分割精度

Result: 在ACDC和Synapse数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定量和定性评估上都表现出优越性

Conclusion: DIFM模块能够有效利用原始和增强图像的互补信息，多尺度边界损失提升了边界分割准确性，整体方法在医学图像分割任务中表现优异

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud
remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and
memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel
lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to
capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D
convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts
directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical
solution for real-world 3D detection on edge devices.

Method: 提出两种神经网络基灵光方法：Neural Bloom Lighting (NBL) 和 Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL)，分别优化质量和性能

Result: 在多种3D场景中测试，FastNBL比现有最佳方案快28%，NBL快12%，同时保持高质量亮度掩码生成

Conclusion: 神经网络方法能够在节省计算资源的同时实现高质量实时灵光效果，推动实时渲染向更高实体性发展

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学可视化任务中自盛监督学习方法多受二维视觉域设计影响，缺乏对3D空间知识学习过程的直观展示，导致医学解释性不足

Method: 设计三个子任务来捐捕3D医学形态的空间相关语义，遵循可观察原则以确保解释性，利用3D形态的增强语义深度，统合多粒度空间关系建模以维持训练稳定性

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能够与当前方法的性能相当，同时有助于直观理解自盛监督学习过程

Conclusion: 该方法通过解释性子任务设计，有效捐捕3D医学形态的空间语义，在保持性能的同时提高了医学可解释性

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniStyle2通过去风格化方法构建大规模数据集DST-100K，训练出基于FLUX.1-dev的前馈模型，在艺术风格迁移任务中超越现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实监督数据的基本挑战，通过去风格化方法获得风格化图像与其内容对应物的对齐数据。

Method: 1) 开发DST文本引导去风格化模型重建无风格内容；2) 使用多阶段评估模型DST-Filter自动筛选高质量数据对；3) 基于DST-100K数据集训练FLUX.1-dev前馈模型。

Result: OmniStyle2在定性和定量基准测试中一致超越最先进方法，证明了通过去风格化进行可扩展数据生成的有效性。

Conclusion: 去风格化为艺术风格迁移提供了可靠的监督范式，克服了缺乏真实数据的根本挑战，大规模数据生成是解决该问题的有效途径。

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

TL;DR: ConstStyle是一个新的域泛化方法，通过将训练和测试数据映射到统一域来减少域偏移影响，在有限训练域和大域差距情况下显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在测试数据分布与训练数据不同时的性能下降问题，传统方法在处理有限训练域或大域差距时效果有限

Method: 提出ConstStyle方法，利用统一域捕获域不变特征并桥接域差距。训练时将所有样本映射到优化后的统一域，测试时类似投影未见域样本

Result: 在多种场景下 consistently 优于现有方法，当只有有限seen domains时，相比次优方法准确率提升高达19.82%

Conclusion: 通过统一域对齐训练和测试数据能有效减少域偏移影响，即使在大域差距或少量seen domains情况下也能显著提升域泛化性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Conclusion: STRIDE模型通过创新的引导策略和架构设计，有效解决了稀疏视图CT重建问题，实现了高质量的图像重建，具有良好的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Conclusion: 通过注入分割信息先验可以有效提升单目3D目标检测性能，特别是对小目标，这种方法提供了一种在不增加模型复杂度的情况下利用额外信息的有效途径

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food

Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人和低视力用户拍摄的照片往往模糊或构图不佳，提出的视觉问题也经常模糊不清，导致多个有效答案，这与传统假设单一答案的VQA系统不匹配。

Method: 使用LoRA调优的BLIP-2模型生成多样候选答案，通过PolyFormer进行空间定位，最后应用链式推理模块评估答案是否指向相同或不同区域。

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中，BLaVe-CoT优于先前方法，对辅助场景中常见的模糊性和视觉噪声更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了VQA系统需要适应真实人类不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持，代码已开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)

Motivation: 现有微表情识别方法存在局限性：手工特征需要关键帧，深度网络受限于小规模和低多样性训练数据。需要一种能够有效捕捉微表情瞬态性、细微性和动态性的方法。

Conclusion: FDP框架通过排序机制有效编码微表情的动态信息，动态图像构建任务有助于捕捉面部细微动作并缓解数据稀缺问题，为微表情识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统视觉-LiDAR里程计方法存在传感器不对准、未能充分利用时序信息、需要大量手动调参等问题，需要开发更准确和鲁棒的方法。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1)稀疏查询融合实现多模态数据融合；2)时序交互更新模块整合时序预测位置；3)时序片段训练策略和集体平均损失机制实现全局优化。

Result: 在KITTI和Argoverse里程计数据集上的广泛实验表明，DVLO4D在姿态精度和鲁棒性方面达到最先进性能，推理时间82ms具有实时部署潜力。

Conclusion: DVLO4D通过创新的稀疏时空融合方法有效解决了传统视觉-LiDAR里程计的局限性，在精度、鲁棒性和效率方面都表现出色，适合实际应用部署。

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time
deployment.

Method: 使用三种VLMs分析100份多样化血液报告图像，通过临床相关问题提示，用Sentence-BERT处理答案进行比较评估。

Result: 通用VLMs在血液报告图像分析方面表现出实用性和前景，能够直接从图像提供清晰解读。

Conclusion: 通用VLMs是开发患者血液报告分析工具的有希望技术，但需谨慎解读结果（数据集有限）。

Abstract: The reliable analysis of blood reports is important for health knowledge, but
individuals often struggle with interpretation, leading to anxiety and
overlooked issues. We explore the potential of general-purpose Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) to address this challenge by automatically analyzing blood report
images. We conduct a comparative evaluation of three VLMs: Qwen-VL-Max, Gemini
2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, determining their performance on a dataset of
100 diverse blood report images. Each model was prompted with clinically
relevant questions adapted to each blood report. The answers were then
processed using Sentence-BERT to compare and evaluate how closely the models
responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood
report analysis. Their ability to provide clear interpretations directly from
images can improve health literacy and reduce the limitations to understanding
complex medical information. This work establishes a foundation for the future
development of reliable and accessible AI-assisted healthcare applications.
While results are encouraging, they should be interpreted cautiously given the

TL;DR: TinyDef-DETR是一个基于DETR的小缺陷检测框架，通过无下采样损失的空间到深度模块、边缘增强卷积、跨阶段双域多尺度注意力模块和Focaler-Wise-SIoU回归损失，显著提升了无人机输电线路小缺陷检测的精度和召回率。


<details>

Motivation: 无人机输电线路自动检测面临小缺陷在复杂背景下难以识别的问题，传统检测器存在细节丢失、边界敏感性不足以及全局上下文与局部线索融合不充分等挑战。

Method: 提出了TinyDef-DETR框架，包含：1）无下采样损失的空间到深度模块；2）边缘增强卷积进行边界感知特征提取；3）跨阶段双域多尺度注意力模块联合捕获全局和局部信息；4）Focaler-Wise-SIoU回归损失改进小目标定位。

Conclusion: 集成细节保留下采样、边缘敏感表示、双域注意力和难度自适应回归，为电网无人机小缺陷检测提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了提出的多阶段GNN方法在模拟网格基流体动力学模拟中复杂传热过程的潜力。

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调策略存在局限性：并行微调隔离任务无法利用共享知识，多任务微调需要同时访问所有数据集且难以增量集成新任务。

Method: 提出MedSeqFT框架，包含两个核心组件：1) MDS选择识别最具代表性的下游样本；2) K&G RFT基于LoRA的知识蒸馏方案，平衡任务特定适应和预训练知识保留。

Result: 在10个3D分割任务上平均Dice提升3.0%，在未见任务上验证了更好的迁移能力，特别是在肿瘤分割方面。

Conclusion: MedSeqFT为适应不断发展的临床任务提供了一个有效且知识保留的顺序微调范式。

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Conclusion: 该研究为解决病理图像分析中的挑战提供了有效的基准测试和训练方案，显著提升了视觉语言模型在病理学领域的应用性能。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

Conclusion: CARDIE为图像增强任务提供了更有效的聚类方法，公开代码以促进采用和确保可复现性。

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像在农业、环境监测等领域有广泛应用，但存在空间分辨率与光谱分辨率之间的权衡。现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度。

Method: 提出SpecSwin3D模型，使用3D移位窗口Transformer框架，采用级联训练策略逐步扩展光谱范围，并设计优化的波段序列来更好地捕捉波段间关系。

Result: 模型在PSNR上达到35.82 dB，SAM为2.40°，SSIM为0.96，比基线MHF-Net提升5.6 dB PSNR，ERGAS降低超过一半。在下游任务如土地利用分类和烧毁区域分割中也表现出实用价值。

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D通过Transformer架构和创新的训练策略，成功解决了多光谱到高光谱图像生成中的空间-光谱权衡问题，为遥感图像处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

Motivation: AI从医学图像中提取生物标志物（如视网膜年龄）存在隐私风险，未经授权使用可能导致生物信息泄露，需要保护个人隐私。

Method: 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制，结合多对一知识蒸馏策略，使用视网膜基础模型和多样化替代年龄编码器来防御黑盒年龄预测模型。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了医学图像生物特征隐私问题，在保护隐私的同时保持了医疗诊断价值，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

Conclusion: UniVerse-1通过创新的专家拼接技术和在线标注方法，成功实现了音频-视频的协调生成，为音频-视频生成研究提供了新的解决方案和基准工具。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

Method: 提出UNO框架，采用扩展的slot attention机制将视觉特征分解为对象和关系slot，引入对象时序一致性学习确保跨帧表示一致性，使用动态三元组预测模块捕捉时序交互。

Result: 在标准框级和像素级VidSGG基准测试中达到有竞争力的性能，同时通过统一设计提高了效率。

Conclusion: UNO证明了统一的对象中心设计可以同时处理不同粒度的视频场景图生成任务，减少了任务特定的修改并最大化参数共享。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Motivation: 实时文档检测和置直是自动信息提取的关键步骤，但目前文献中缺乏高效的解决方案。本文旨在开发一种既能满足OCR提取需求又比现有方案更快的文档检测管道。

Method: 适配IWPOD-Net（车牌检测网络）到文档检测任务，使用NBID合成ID卡数据集进行训练。进行数据增帽和跨数据集验证（MIDV数据集），寻找最优模型。使用基于Levenshtein距离的新的OCR质量指标评估性能。

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在3D空间关系理解方面存在局限，而现实世界的具身AI智能体（如机器人和自动驾驶汽车）需要基于自我中心多视角观测的空间推理能力。

Method: 创建包含8,600多个QA对的Ego3D-Bench基准测试，并提出了Ego3D-VLM后训练框架，通过生成基于估计全局3D坐标的认知地图来增强空间推理。

Result: 基准测试显示当前SOTA VLMs与人类水平存在显著差距，Ego3D-VLM在多选题QA上平均提升12%，在绝对距离估计上平均提升56%。

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench和Ego3D-VLM为在真实世界多视角环境中实现人类水平空间理解提供了有价值的工具，当前VLMs仍需改进空间理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

Method: 构建了一个多阶段系统解决方案，包括SH/TEWL数据收集、数据预处理，以及创新的Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型进行SH/TEWL回归预测，并使用对称基对比正则化来减少数据注释不平衡导致的偏差

Result: 成功开发了从自拍面部图片远程估算SH和TEWL的系统，为普通用户提供了一种无需专业仪器的皮肤健康评估方法

Conclusion: 这是首个从自拍面部图片进行皮肤评估的研究，平桥了计算机视觉与护肤研究之间的间隔，为AI驱动的普及化皮肤分析开启了广阔的实际应用前景

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

TL;DR: PAML框架通过多模态学习和原型发现机制解决视觉定位在开放词汇场景中的挑战，在标准场景表现优异，在开放词汇场景达到SOTA


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的方法在标准场景定位表现良好，但在开放词汇场景（包含训练时未见的新物体类别）存在三个主要限制：视觉-语言模态对齐不完美、跨模态特征融合不足、语义原型信息利用不充分

Method: 提出Prototype-Aware Multimodal Learning (PAML)框架：1)使用ALBEF进行初始跨模态对齐 2)视觉判别特征编码器增强显著对象表示 3)原型发现和继承机制提取聚合多邻居语义原型 4)多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，在标准场景表现有竞争力，在开放词汇场景达到最先进水平

Conclusion: PAML通过系统解决跨模态对齐、特征融合和原型利用问题，显著提升了开放词汇视觉定位的性能

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Video-GCD任务，将广义类别发现扩展到视频领域，并开发了MCCL框架，通过一致性感知对比学习和记忆引导表示增强来有效整合时空信息，显著优于现有图像GCD方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要关注静态图像，但仅依赖视觉内容往往不足以可靠发现新类别。视频包含丰富的时序信息，可以更好地支持类别发现，因此需要将GCD扩展到视频领域。

Method: 提出Memory-guided Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL)框架，包含两个核心组件：一致性感知对比学习(CACL)利用多视角时序特征估计一致性分数来加权对比损失；记忆引导表示增强(MGRE)使用双级记忆缓冲区维护特征级和logit级表示，提供全局上下文。

Result: 在构建的Video-GCD基准测试（包括动作识别和鸟类分类视频数据集）上进行了广泛实验，证明该方法显著优于从图像设置改编的竞争性GCD方法。

Conclusion: 时序信息对于视频中新类别的发现至关重要，MCCL框架通过整合时空线索和建立表示学习与一致性建模之间的相互增强反馈循环，有效解决了Video-GCD挑战。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言任务中表现突出，但有效整合图像分割仍面临挑战。需要一种简化分割过程、无需额外解码器的方案。

Method: 提出文本作为掩码的新范式：1)语义描述符把图像补丁映射到文本标签；2)行向运行长度编码(R-RLE)压缩重复文本，提高3倍推理速度；3)框向语义描述符和语义砖结构化表示区域掩码。

Result: 在自然图像和遥感数据集上，Text4Seg++在多个标准测试集上都超过最先进模型，无需任务特定微调，且与现有MLLM背榜兼容。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了文本驱动图像分割在MLLM框架下的有效性、可扩展性和通用性，为简化分割过程提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型、数据集和视频理解任务（如推理时间定位和密集描述）上都展现出良好的普遍性和提升效果

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的面部防欺骗方法未能充分利用CLIP的补丁嵌入令牌，且依赖单一文本提示，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出MVP-FAS框架，包含多视角注意力模块(MVS)和多文本补丁对齐模块(MTPA)，利用多个释义文本生成泛化特征。

Result: 在跨域数据集上实现了优异的泛化性能，超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过多视角和多文本策略有效提升了面部防欺骗的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可插拔的尺度感知注意力模块(SAAM)，能够将现有的固定尺度超分辨率模型改造为支持任意尺度超分辨率的模型，具有轻量化和高性能的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的单图像超分辨率模型往往难以在不同尺度因子间泛化，限制了其在实际应用中的适用性。需要一种方法能够使现有模型具备任意尺度超分辨率能力。

Method: 设计了一个轻量级的尺度自适应特征提取和上采样模块，结合了简单的无参数注意力模块(SimAM)进行高效指导，并使用梯度方差损失来增强图像细节的清晰度。

Result: 该方法能够无缝集成到多个最先进的SR骨干网络中，在广泛的整数和非整数尺度因子下都表现出竞争性或更优的性能，计算开销极小。

Conclusion: SAAM模块为实际应用场景提供了一个实用的解决方案，实现了鲁棒的多尺度上采样能力。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),
traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors,
limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in
Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR
models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs
lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating
the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and
gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method
integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide
range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution
for real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 这项研究开发了一个自动化流水线，用于分析脑转移稳定急急照射治疗的纵向数据，通过数据驱动聚类识别了5种主要增长轨迹，并使用机器学习方法预测12个月的病变响应，取得了高达0.90 AUC的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑转移是癌症患者死亡的主要原因之一。虽然有规律急急照射治疗和MRI监测，但长期形式的图像分析工作量过大，导致随访图像往往只通过观察评估，缺乏精确的消化量化分析。

Method: 建立了一个自动化流水线来管理大规模的纵向SRS治疗数据（896个脑转移、177名患者）。使用数据驱动的聚类方法识别特征性增长轨迹，并采用梯度提升和图机器学习方法预测12个月的病变响应。

Result: 聚类分析显示了5种主要增长轨迹，每种轨迹有明显不同的最终响应类别。预测模型在仅使用治前和第一次随访MRI的情况下取得了0.90 AUC的高性能（CI95%=0.88-0.92）。图机器学习方法也达到0.88 AUC的稳健预测性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究为脑转移SRS治疗响应的全面评估和预测提供了潜在的自动化和提高精确性。提出的流氵线促进了可扩展的数据管理，为优化个性化谨疗的临床决策支持系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

Result: 在Garden场景上展示了改进方案的码率-失真性能，提高了限制视角区域内的重建质量

Conclusion: 球坐标量化方案能够有效减少大场景中因视角限制导致的投影误差，提高3DoF+情况下的重建效果

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

TL;DR: Phantom-Insight是一种基于SAM和MLLM的视频伪装目标检测方法，通过特征融合、动态评分模块和解耦学习策略，解决了现有方法在边缘分离和目标背景区分方面的不足，在MoCA-Mask数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有VCOD方法存在两个主要问题：(1)SAM-based方法由于模型冻结难以分离伪装目标边缘；(2)MLLM-based方法因大语言模型合并前景背景而导致目标可分性差。

Method: 提出Phantom-Insight方法：1)使用时序和空间线索表示视频序列，通过LLM进行特征融合；2)通过动态前景视觉token评分模块和提示网络生成多线索，自适应指导SAM模型；3)提出解耦的前景-背景学习策略，分别生成前景背景线索进行解耦训练。

Result: 在MoCA-Mask数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在CAD2016数据集上展示了检测未见伪装目标的强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight通过结合SAM和MLLM的优势，有效解决了视频伪装目标检测中的边缘分离和目标背景区分问题，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，为通过对比注意力改进视觉推理提供了高效途径

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

TL;DR: DINOv3作为基于自然图像训练的视觉基础模型，在医学图像任务中显示出了让人印象深刻的性能，甚至能够超越部分医学特定基础模型，但在需要深度领域专门知识的场景中表现有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究基于自然图像领域领先训练的大规模视觉基础模型如何转移到医学图像专业领域，探索DINOv3是否可以直接作为医学视觉任务的统一编码器而无需领域特定领先训练。

Method: 在广泛的医学图像模态上对DINOv3进行基准测试，包括2D/3D分类和分割任务，系统分析不同模型规模和输入分辨率对性能的影响。

Result: DINOv3在多个医学图像任务中显示出让人印象深刻的性能，甚至能够超越BiomedCLIP和CT-Net等医学特定基础模型。但在需要深度领域专门知识的场景中（如WSI、EM、PET）表现有限，且不遵循缩放定律。

Conclusion: DINOv3可以作为医学视觉任务的强大基准线，其强大的视觉特征可以作为多个复杂医学任务的稳健先验知识，为未来研究开启了新方向。

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSG-Net是一个频率-空间协同门控网络，通过频域分析和空间注意力机制有效分离真实变化与伪变化，在多个变化检测基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率遥感图像变化检测中的两个关键挑战：1）模型容易将时间偏移（如光照、季节变化）导致的辐射变化误判为真实变化；2）深层抽象特征与浅层细节特征之间存在语义鸿沟，导致边界分割不准确。

Method: 提出FSG-Net框架，包含三个核心模块：1）DAWIM模块在频域自适应处理不同频率分量以抑制伪变化；2）STSAM模块在空间域增强真实变化区域的显著性；3）LGFU模块利用高层语义门控选择性地整合浅层细节特征。

Result: 在CDD、GZ-CD和LEVIR-CD三个基准数据集上分别达到94.16%、89.51%和91.27%的F1分数，建立了新的state-of-the-art性能。

Conclusion: FSG-Net通过频域和空间域的协同处理，有效解决了变化检测中的伪变化问题和特征融合难题，为高分辨率遥感图像变化检测提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at
https://github.com/zxXie-Air/FSG-Net after a possible publication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于操作前后图像差异的弱监督分割方法，用于废物分拣自动化，并发布了包含11000+帧的多视角数据集WS²


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业质量控制中人工分拣效率低下，完全监督方法需要大量标注，而操作员移除动作提供的隐式监督未被充分利用

Method: 提出Before-After Supervision概念，利用操作前后的图像差异训练分割网络，建立了端到端流程并测试多种弱监督分割方法

Result: 创建了WS²数据集，包含11000多帧高分辨率视频帧，为弱监督分割研究提供了基准平台

Conclusion: 操作前后的视觉差异为弱监督分割提供了有效的监督信号，该方法在废物分拣自动化中具有应用潜力

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法充分解决主题驱动图像生成中保持主体身份与遵循动态编辑指令之间的张力冲突

Method: 提出目标监督三元组对齐方法，使用(参考图像、指令、目标图像)三元组建模主体适应动态，通过DSD目标训练模型并系统生成评估"获胜"和"失败"目标

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现出优异性能，在保持主体忠实性的同时维持指令遵循度，在多个量化指标上超越基线方法

Conclusion: TIDE框架成功解决了主题驱动图像生成中的核心挑战，展示了在结构条件生成、图像到图像生成和文本图像插值等多种任务中的通用性

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

Method: 细调ResNet-18提取多模态MRI图像特征，融合4800+摄像组学和临床特征，使用CatBoost分类器进行56类响应预测

Result: 在4类响应预测任务中达到平均ROC AUC 0.81和Macro F1分数0.50

Conclusion: 深度学习图像表征与领域特征的协同融合提供了脑神经瘤学治疗响应评估的稳健有效解决方案

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文重现了FairCLIP方法，发现原始实现与描述不一致，提出了A-FairCLIP和FairCLIP+改进方法，但实验结果并不支持FairCLIP能提高CLIP的性能和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重现FairCLIP方法的实验结果，验证其是否真正能够改善CLIP模型在敏感群体上的公平性问题。

Method: 重现原始实验设置，发现实现与描述不一致后提出A-FairCLIP重新实现，并提出FairCLIP+扩展多属性目标，分析距离最小化对公平性和性能的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示CLIP在零样本青光眼分类任务中存在人口统计学偏见，但FairCLIP方法无法改善性能或公平性，虽然Sinkhorn距离减小了。

Conclusion: 虽然FairCLIP能够减小Sinkhorn距离，但在实际应用中无法有效提高CLIP的公平性和性能，需要更深入的研究来解决这些偏见问题。

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Result: EfficientTAM模型在FMO数据集上表现与专门设计的管道相当，验证了FMOX格式的有效性。

Conclusion: FMOX JSON格式为FMO数据集提供了标准化的超级标注，支持更好的机器学习管道处理，所有代码和JSON文件都开源分享。

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

TL;DR: 通过重新设计训练目标和方法，提出了一种更加稳健的场景级素描基于图像检索方法，能够处理手绘素描的模糊性和噪声问题


<details>

Motivation: 解决现有场景级素描基于图像检索方法对手绘素描的内在模糊性和噪声问题的敏感性，提高检索模型的稳健性

Method: 结合预训练、编码器架构和损失函数设计，专门设计了能够承受素描变异性的训练目标

Result: 在FS-COCO和SketchyCOCO数据集上达到了状态下的最佳性能，而无需增加额外的模型复杂度

Conclusion: 训练设计在跨模态检索任务中具有关键作用，同时需要改进场景级SBIR的评估场景

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了RARL方法，用于解决增量开集识别(IOSR)中的边界潜移问题，通过角度空间对齐和虚拟类交互训练，在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet上达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开集识别方法主要面向静态场景，而真实场景需要模型能够增量识别新出现的未知类，但缺乏历史训练数据导致类间混淆问题。

Method: 提出保持性角度表征学习(RARL)：1)在等角紧凑框架下构建角度空间，将未知表征对齐到静止原型；2)采用虚拟-内在交互(VII)训练策略，通过边界近伺虚拟类增强类间距离；3)分层校正策略修正边界偏差。

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上进行了全面评估，建立了IOSR的新标准，在各种任务设置下都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RARL方法能够有效缓解增量开集识别中的表征潜移问题，通过角度空间组织和虚拟类交互，实现了更稳定的识别边界和更好的知识更新能力。

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有的多视角扩散模型大多采用非自回归形式，限制了其适用性，只能支持固定数量的视角，且由于同时去噪所有帧而导致推理速度慢

Method: 采用因果掩码和逐帧噪声训练，使用成对相对相机位姿编码(CaPE)实现精确相机控制，推理时结合空间感知滑动窗口、键值缓存和噪声条件增强来减轻漂移

Result: CausNVS支持广泛的相机轨迹，实现灵活的自回归新视角合成，在多样化设置下保持一致的强视觉质量

Conclusion: 自回归多视角扩散模型CausNVS成功解决了非自回归方法的局限性，为3D新视角合成提供了更灵活高效的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

Motivation: 低剂量CT和PET虽然减少了辐射暴露，但会导致噪声和伪影增加，影响诊断准确性，需要有效的降噪方法来提升图像质量

Method: 提出混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块增强空间和通道交互，以及混合上采样模块防止噪声过拟合

Result: 在公开LDCT/PET数据集上验证，HSANet相比现有方法获得更优越的去噪性能，同时保持轻量级模型大小，适合标准GPU部署

Conclusion: 该方法具有很高的实际临床应用价值，能够在保持辐射安全的同时显著提升低剂量医学图像质量

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

Method: 提出一种深度学习框架，结合RGB、多光谱和两种红外波长四种成像模态，使用CNN提取空间特征和LSTM捕捉时间依赖关系

Result: CNN-LSTM模型达到98%的准确率，显著超过仅使用空间特征的CNN模型(80.45%)和其他机器学习方法(76%)

Conclusion: 该方法能有效捕捉氮素缺乏、水分压力和杂草压力之间的复杂交互作用，为及时预防急急识别提供了有力工具

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Motivation: 解决生物打印过程中因图像数据有限和嵌入式硬件资源约束而导致的打印结构保真度和一致性问题，需要实时语义分割来区分噴嘴、粘材和背景，以维持打印质量和生物活性。

Method: 构建了包含787张RGB图像的手动标注数据集，提出BioLite U-Net模型，利用深度分离卷积大幅降低计算复杂度。在Raspberry Pi 4B上与MobileNetV2和MobileNetV3基线模型进行性能测试。

Result: BioLite U-Net达到了92.85%的mIoU和96.17%的Dice分数，模型大小比MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+小1300倍，每帧推理时间仅335ms，实现了几乎实时的性能。

Conclusion: BioLite U-Net在分割准确性、效率和部署性方面都优于MobileNet基线模型，适合集成到智能闭环生物打印系统中。

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STAGE是一种面向分割的工业异常合成方法，通过分级扩散和显式掩码对齐技术，解决了现有方法在纹理细节、背景对齐和细粒度异常生成方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工业异常合成方法存在两个关键问题：合成的异常缺乏精细纹理细节且与背景对齐不精确，以及难以生成像素级的细粒度异常。这限制了异常分割性能的提升。

Method: 提出了STAGE方法，包含三个核心组件：1）引入干净背景信息作为先验来指导去噪分布；2）采用分级扩散框架，通过异常分支显式记录局部异常；3）使用显式掩码对齐策略逐步对齐合成异常与背景。

Result: 在MVTec和BTAD数据集上的大量实验表明，STAGE在工业异常合成方面达到了最先进的性能，并有效提升了下游异常分割任务的表现。

Conclusion: STAGE通过创新的异常推理策略、分级扩散框架和显式掩码对齐，成功解决了工业异常合成中的关键挑战，为异常分割提供了更高质量的合成数据支持。

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Conclusion: 证明了协同分割框架在病理图像分析中的有效性，通过组织和核细分割任务的相互增强提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

Method: 采用三种对比学习框架（实例判别、上下文对比学习、多视图对比学习），结合LRCN（CNN+LSTM）骨干网络和Bahdanau注意力机制，使用NT-Xent、NT-logistic和Margin Triplet等对比损失函数

Result: 在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下取得最佳性能：88%准确率和0.8815 F1分数，能够有效区分PG-13和R级内容等细粒度边界

Conclusion: 提出的混合架构结合对比学习在视频年龄分级任务中表现优异，已部署为实时分类的Web应用，为流媒体平台提供自动化内容合规解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanTwin数据集是三个公开路边激光雷达数据集（LUMPI、V2X-Real-IC、TUMTraf-I）的高保真合成复制品，每个包含10K标注帧，用于3D目标检测、跟踪和分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实激光雷达数据采集成本高、标注困难的问题，通过数字孪生技术生成高质量合成数据来增强现有基准数据集。

Method: 使用基于真实场景几何、道路对齐和车辆运动模式的数字孪生模型，通过模拟激光雷达传感器合成数据集，包含3D边界框、实例分割标签、跟踪ID和语义分割标签。

Result: 合成数据集与真实数据在统计和结构上高度相似，仅使用合成数据训练的3D目标检测模型在真实数据上表现优于使用真实数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: UrbanTwin数据集首次实现了用合成数据替代真实激光雷达感知任务数据集，能有效增加样本量和场景多样性，具有独立使用和数据增强价值。

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at
https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助放射学诊断主要基于单一任务的窄模型，无法覆盖广泛的成像模态和疾病谱。基础模型在放射学领域的潜力尚未充分实现。

Method: 使用一家大型医院数年的全部横断面成像输出数据（15万次检查，130TB）训练Curia基础模型，并在新构建的19任务外部验证基准上进行评估。

Conclusion: Curia证明了基础模型在放射学中的巨大潜力，为加速该领域进展，作者在Hugging Face上发布了模型权重。

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the
process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part
segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation
of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a
feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly
3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that
our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be
released soon.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统卷积网络感矩场局限和变换器模型计算复杂度高的问题，为实时和资源限制的临床环境提供高效分割方案。

Method: 设计结合Swin Transformer类似编码器和U-Net类似解码器的端到端轻量级架构，通过skip路径保体空间细节，先使用Barlow Twins自监督方法预训练编码器，然后精细调整整个模型。

Result: 在二值分割工作中达到竞争性的准确度，参数数量显著减少，推理速度更快，适合实时和资源限制的临床部署。

Conclusion: 该模型为医学图像分割提供了一种高效、轻量化的实用方案，在保持性能的同时大幅提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github
repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.

Conclusion: 通过3D生成技术构建的real2sim2real系统有效解决了当前感知模拟在多样性和可扩展性方面的限制

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our
datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex
ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent
blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow
metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for
video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to
extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion
amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge
existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the

Conclusion: IRG框架通过交替推理和生成有效提升了文本到图像生成的质量，证明了交错推理在图像生成任务中的价值

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

TL;DR: 提出H$_2$OT分层剪枝恢复框架，通过动态选择代表性帧的pose tokens减少计算量，最后恢复完整序列，在保持精度的同时显著提升视频3D人体姿态估计的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频姿态变换器(VPTs)计算成本高，在资源受限设备上不实用，需要一种高效的方法来减少冗余计算。

Method: 提出分层即插即用剪枝恢复框架H$_2$OT，包含Token剪枝模块(TPM)动态选择代表性tokens，和Token恢复模块(TRM)恢复完整时空信息。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性和效率，既能保持高精度又能显著提升推理速度。

Conclusion: 研究表明维持完整姿态序列是不必要的，少量代表性帧的pose tokens即可实现高效准确的姿态估计，该方法可轻松集成到常见VPT模型中。

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are
available at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.

Motivation: 探索通用基础模型通过迁移学习和多模态数据整合在手术数据科学中的应用潜力，以提升手术决策支持能力。

Method: 使用V-JEPA作为单模态基础，通过在未标注手术视频上微调进行领域适配，并整合手术室其他时间分辨数据流构建多模态模型。在本地肝脏手术数据集和公开HeiCo数据集上评估医院住院时间预测、手术后并发症预测和手术时期识别任务。

Conclusion: 手术数据科学可以利用公开通用基础模型，通过领域适配和整合适宜的多模态数据流，为手术决策支持提供强大工具。

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合选择性GAN去模糊预处理和YOLOv5检测架构的自动车牌识别系统，在保持高准确度的同时实现了快速实时检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动车牌识别系统在智慧城市中至关重要，但因车牌形状、光照、模糊等高变性而面临挑战。需要一种能够处理模糊车牌并实现高准确度实时检测的方案。

Method: 采用选择性GAN进行去模糊预处理（避免不必要的输入操作），结合YOLOv5对象检测架构进行车牌检测和字符分割识别。使用伊朗车牌数据集进行训练和测试。

Result: 检测时间仅0.026秒，车牌检测准确率95%，字符识别准确率97%。去模糊GAN预处理器将检测准确度提高了近40%，特别是对模糊车牌。

Conclusion: 结合YOLOv5和Deblur-GAN的综合模型在保持高准确度的同时实现了快速实时检测，特别适用于可移动应用。去模糊预处理步骤显著提升了模型在处理模糊场景时的整体性能。

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

TL;DR: 提出在非欧几里得球面特征空间中进行相似性学习，使用CNN-Transformer编码器提取特征嵌入，通过黎曼距离近似测地距离，结合Levenberg-Marquardt优化提升2D/3D配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有欧几里得近似方法扭曲流形结构并减缓收敛速度，需要更好的方法来捕捉复杂流形结构以提高配准性能。

Method: 使用CNN-Transformer编码器提取特征嵌入，投影到球面空间，在SO(4)空间中用黎曼距离近似测地距离，推理时采用可微Levenberg-Marquardt优化。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上实验显示，在患者特定和非特定场景下均获得优越的配准精度。

Conclusion: 非欧几里得球面特征空间的相似性学习方法能够更好地捕捉流形结构，显著提升2D/3D配准的准确性和收敛速度。

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

Motivation: 为了解决盲图像恢复任务中需要训练复杂特征提取器的问题，同时充分利用预训练扩散模型的强大先验知识，开发一种低复杂度但高性能的适配器方案。

Method: 从退化图像中通过模型本身提取特征，扩展自注意力机制融入退化特征，引入采样引导机制减少幻觉，采用适配器设计可集成到其他扩散模型中。

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter提供了一种高效、低复杂度的盲图像恢复解决方案，其适配器设计具有良好的扩展性和应用前景。

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用预训练模型在农业视觉监测中泛化能力不足，因为精细多变的冠层结构与波动的田间条件相互作用，需要作物特定的基础模型来提高可靠性。

Method: 使用自监督学习在ImAg4Wheat数据集（来自30个全球站点、2000多个基因型和500多个环境条件的250万张小麦图像）上预训练小麦专用视觉基础模型。

Result: FoMo4Wheat在冠层和器官级别的10个田间视觉任务中一致优于最先进的通用预训练模型，且其表示对小麦具有鲁棒性并可转移到其他作物和杂草。

Conclusion: 作物特定基础模型对可靠的田间感知具有重要价值，为开发具有跨物种和跨任务能力的通用作物基础模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat
dataset are publicly available online: https://github.com/PheniX-Lab/FoMo4Wheat

TL;DR: ManipDreamer3D是一个从输入图像和文本指令生成3D感知机器人操作视频的新框架，通过3D轨迹规划和轨迹到视频扩散模型解决数据稀缺问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人操作领域面临数据稀缺挑战，现有基于2D轨迹的扩散模型方法存在3D空间模糊性问题，需要开发能够生成合理3D轨迹的机器人操作视频生成方法

Method: 首先从输入图像重建3D占用表示，然后计算优化的3D末端执行器轨迹（最小化路径长度并避免碰撞），最后使用潜在编辑技术和专门训练的轨迹到视频扩散模型生成视频序列

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有方法相比，该方法在视觉质量上表现出优越性，能够生成具有自主规划合理3D轨迹的机器人视频

Conclusion: ManipDreamer3D框架能够显著减少人工干预需求，为机器人操作视频生成提供了有效的3D感知解决方案

Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic
manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for
generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D
trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this
work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating
plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the
text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a
reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along
with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D
first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and
then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length
while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create
video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.
This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion
model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic
videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly
reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate
superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

Motivation: 当前研究对LLM在自主驾驶车中的评估仅限于合成数据集或手动驾驶数据，缺乏真实边缘案例的测试，需要在当前自主驾驶系统已失败的真实场景中评估LLM的异常检测能力。

Method: 构建了一种开放词汇目标检测器组合prompt工程和大语言模型上下文推理的架构，在真实世界边缘案例上评估多个独立模型。

Conclusion: 论文为LLM在自主驾驶车异常检测领域的应用提供了实证性评估，证明了其在真实边缘案例中的效果，为该方向的研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their
boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research
community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous
vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning
software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or
manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more
precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in
the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on
real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to
fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector
coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.
We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide
qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the
potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.

Motivation: 探索大语言模型作为混合接口的能力，通过自然语言协议连接生物和人工系统，创造新型的人工生命形式

Method: 使用异步运行的大语言模型模块网络（感知、视觉、对话、行动模块），通过自然语言通信将多模态数据转换为语言消息，协调系统行为

Conclusion: 这种去中心化的LLM模块协调方法为生物与人工系统之间的新型交互提供了可能，开辟了新的人工生命模型研究方向

Abstract: We introduce Plantbot, a hybrid lifeform that connects a living plant with a
mobile robot through a network of large language model (LLM) modules. Each
module - responsible for sensing, vision, dialogue, or action - operates
asynchronously and communicates via natural language, enabling seamless
interaction across biological and artificial domains. This architecture
leverages the capacity of LLMs to serve as hybrid interfaces, where natural
language functions as a universal protocol, translating multimodal data (soil
moisture, temperature, visual context) into linguistic messages that coordinate
system behaviors. The integrated network transforms plant states into robotic
actions, installing normativity essential for agency within the sensor-motor
loop. By combining biological and robotic elements through LLM-mediated
communication, Plantbot behaves as an embodied, adaptive agent capable of
responding autonomously to environmental conditions. This approach suggests
possibilities for a new model of artificial life, where decentralized, LLM
modules coordination enable novel interactions between biological and
artificial systems.

Conclusion: 隐式神经场为多轴3D打印提供了高效的统一计算框架，支持连续优化和可微碰撞处理，具有显著性能优势

Abstract: We introduce a general, scalable computational framework for multi-axis 3D
printing based on implicit neural fields (INFs) that unifies all stages of
toolpath generation and global collision-free motion planning. In our pipeline,
input models are represented as signed distance fields, with fabrication
objectives such as support-free printing, surface finish quality, and extrusion
control being directly encoded in the optimization of an implicit guidance
field. This unified approach enables toolpath optimization across both surface
and interior domains, allowing shell and infill paths to be generated via
implicit field interpolation. The printing sequence and multi-axis motion are
then jointly optimized over a continuous quaternion field. Our continuous
formulation constructs the evolving printing object as a time-varying SDF,
supporting differentiable global collision handling throughout INF-based motion
planning. Compared to explicit-representation-based methods, INF-3DP achieves
up to two orders of magnitude speedup and significantly reduces
waypoint-to-surface error. We validate our framework on diverse, complex models
and demonstrate its efficiency with physical fabrication experiments using a
robot-assisted multi-axis system.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous drone swarms in disaster response missions
necessitates the development of flexible, scalable, and robust coordination
systems. Traditional fixed architectures struggle to cope with dynamic and
unpredictable environments, leading to inefficiencies in energy consumption and
connectivity. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an adaptive
architecture for drone swarms, leveraging a Large Language Model to dynamically
select the optimal architecture as centralized, hierarchical, or holonic based
on real time mission parameters such as task complexity, swarm size, and
communication stability. Our system addresses the challenges of scalability,
adaptability, and robustness,ensuring efficient energy consumption and
maintaining connectivity under varying conditions. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that our adaptive architecture outperforms traditional static
models in terms of scalability, energy efficiency, and connectivity. These
results highlight the potential of our approach to provide a scalable,
adaptable, and resilient solution for real world disaster response scenarios.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
classification, their application to continuous motor control remains limited.
Here, we demonstrate that fully spiking architectures can be trained end-to-end
to control robotic arms with multiple degrees of freedom in continuous
environments. Our predictive-control framework combines Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire dynamics with surrogate gradients, jointly optimizing a
forward model for dynamics prediction and a policy network for goal-directed
action. We evaluate this approach on both a planar 2D reaching task and a
simulated 6-DOF Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that SNNs can achieve
stable training and accurate torque control, establishing their viability for
high-dimensional motor tasks. An extensive ablation study highlights the role
of initialization, learnable time constants, and regularization in shaping
training dynamics. We conclude that while stable and effective control can be
achieved, recurrent spiking networks remain highly sensitive to hyperparameter
settings, underscoring the importance of principled design choices.

Abstract: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences
presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in
understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships
between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that
incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code
generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence,
which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal
coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code
generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code
reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness
and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly
enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and
code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and
spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce
LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action
sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial
complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that
existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework
establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个高速、可扩展的多机器人任务与运动规划解决方案，能够自动化现代制造中的复杂协调任务，并为故障容锐规划和在线重新规划打开了新可能性。

Abstract: Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple
robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although
individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation,
scheduling, and motion planning under spatio-temporal constraints remain
computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales.
Existing multi-arm systems deployed in the industry rely on human intuition and
experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive
process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an
obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a
shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our
approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on
procedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot
configurations, and task distributions. It employs a graph representation of
scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through reinforcement learning
to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the sub-problems
of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly
generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen
settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We
further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its
use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and
scalability of our planner also open the door to new capabilities such as
fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based re-planning, where rapid
adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.

Abstract: Haptic interfaces that can simultaneously modulate multiple physical
properties remain a fundamental challenge in human-robot interaction. Existing
systems typically allow the rendering of either geometric features or
mechanical properties, but rarely both, within wearable form factors. Here, we
introduce HapMorph, a pneumatic framework that enables continuous, simultaneous
modulation of object size and stiffness through antagonistic fabric-based
pneumatic actuators (AFPAs). We implemented a HapMorph protoytpe designed for
hands interaction achieving size variation from 50 to 104 mm, stiffness
modulation up to 4.7 N/mm and mass of the wearable parts of just 21 g. Through
systematic characterization, we demonstrate decoupled control of size and
stiffness properties via dual-chamber pressure regulation. Human perception
studies with 10 participants reveal that users can distinguish nine discrete
states across three size categories and three stiffness levels with 89.4%
accuracy and 6.7 s average response time. We further demonstrate extended
architectures that combine AFPAs with complementary pneumatic structures to
enable shape or geometry morphing with concurrent stiffness control. Our
results establish antagonistic pneumatic principle as a pathway toward
next-generation haptic interfaces, capable of multi-dimensiona rendering
properties within practical wearable constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous regolith excavation is a cornerstone of in-situ resource
utilization for a sustained human presence beyond Earth. However, this task is
fundamentally hindered by the complex interaction dynamics of granular media
and the operational need for robots to use diverse tools. To address these
challenges, this work introduces a framework where a model-based reinforcement
learning agent learns within a parallelized simulation. This environment
leverages high-fidelity particle physics and procedural generation to create a
vast distribution of both lunar terrains and excavation tool geometries. To
master this diversity, the agent learns an adaptive interaction strategy by
dynamically modulating its own stiffness and damping at each control step
through operational space control. Our experiments demonstrate that training
with a procedural distribution of tools is critical for generalization and
enables the development of sophisticated tool-aware behavior. Furthermore, we
show that augmenting the agent with visual feedback significantly improves task
success. These results represent a validated methodology for developing the
robust and versatile autonomous systems required for the foundational tasks of
future space missions.

Motivation: 血管中自主微米机器人的导航面临密集移动障碍物的挑战，需要开发能够处理突发移动障碍物的实时路径规划策略。

Method: 结合分析几何全局规划器(AGP)与两种局部跑脱控制器（规则基础和强化学习基础），利用实时成像估计微米机器人、障碍物和目标位置，计算无碰撞运动。

Result: 在模拟中AGP比WA*、PSO和RRT算法路径更短、规划更快，并保持可行性和确定性。平均规划时间40ms，兼容25fps实时控制。在模拟和实验中都能可靠避免移动障碍物并到达目标。

Conclusion: 该框架推进了血管环境中微米机器人自主导航和目标药物途径投送的发展，为微创治疗提供了技术支撑。

Abstract: Autonomous microrobots in blood vessels could enable minimally invasive
therapies, but navigation is challenged by dense, moving obstacles. We propose
a real-time path planning framework that couples an analytic geometry global
planner (AGP) with two reactive local escape controllers, one based on rules
and one based on reinforcement learning, to handle sudden moving obstacles.
Using real-time imaging, the system estimates the positions of the microrobot,
obstacles, and targets and computes collision-free motions. In simulation, AGP
yields shorter paths and faster planning than weighted A* (WA*), particle swarm
optimization (PSO), and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), while maintaining
feasibility and determinism. We extend AGP from 2D to 3D without loss of speed.
In both simulations and experiments, the combined global planner and local
controllers reliably avoid moving obstacles and reach targets. The average
planning time is 40 ms per frame, compatible with 25 fps image acquisition and
real-time closed-loop control. These results advance autonomous microrobot
navigation and targeted drug delivery in vascular environments.

Abstract: We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based locomotion system for Cosmo, a
custom-built humanoid robot designed for entertainment applications. Unlike
traditional humanoids, entertainment robots present unique challenges due to
aesthetic-driven design choices. Cosmo embodies these with a disproportionately
large head (16% of total mass), limited sensing, and protective shells that
considerably restrict movement. To address these challenges, we apply
Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to enable the robot to learn natural-looking
movements while maintaining physical stability. We develop tailored domain
randomization techniques and specialized reward structures to ensure safe
sim-to-real, protecting valuable hardware components during deployment. Our
experiments demonstrate that AMP generates stable standing and walking
behaviors despite Cosmo's extreme mass distribution and movement constraints.
These results establish a promising direction for robots that balance aesthetic
appeal with functional performance, suggesting that learning-based methods can
effectively adapt to aesthetic-driven design constraints.

Abstract: Detecting and localizing glass in 3D environments poses significant
challenges for visual perception systems, as the optical properties of glass
often hinder conventional sensors from accurately distinguishing glass
surfaces. The lack of real-world datasets focused on glass objects further
impedes progress in this field. To address this issue, we introduce a new
dataset featuring a wide range of glass configurations with precise 3D
annotations, collected from distinct real-world scenarios. On the basis of this
dataset, we propose MonoGlass3D, a novel approach tailored for monocular 3D
glass detection across diverse environments. To overcome the challenges posed
by the ambiguous appearance and context diversity of glass, we propose an
adaptive feature fusion module that empowers the network to effectively capture
contextual information in varying conditions. Additionally, to exploit the
distinct planar geometry of glass surfaces, we present a plane regression
pipeline, which enables seamless integration of geometric properties within our
framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both glass segmentation and monocular glass
depth estimation. Our results highlight the advantages of combining geometric
and contextual cues for transparent surface understanding.

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究探索影响用户偏好和性能的深层因素。

Abstract: Telepresence robots enable users to interact with remote environments, but
efficient and intuitive navigation remains a challenge. In this work, we
developed and evaluated a shared control method, in which the robot navigates
autonomously while allowing users to affect the path generation to better suit
their needs. We compared this with control switching, where users toggle
between direct and automated control. We hypothesized that shared control would
maintain efficiency comparable to control switching while potentially reducing
user workload. The results of two consecutive user studies (each with final
sample of n=20) showed that shared control does not degrade navigation
efficiency, but did not show a significant reduction in task load compared to
control switching. Further research is needed to explore the underlying factors
that influence user preference and performance in these control systems.

Conclusion: A-star PRM在路径质量、稳定性和计算效率方面具有综合优势，特别适用于狭窄通道和动态障碍物场景。

Abstract: Robot path planning is a fundamental challenge in enhancing the environmental
adaptability of autonomous navigation systems. This paper presents a hybrid
path planning algorithm, A-star PRM, which incorporates dynamic weights. By
embedding the Manhattan distance heuristic of the A-star algorithm into the
random sampling process of PRM, the algorithm achieves a balanced optimization
of path quality and computational efficiency. The approach uses a hierarchical
sampling strategy and a dynamic connection mechanism, greatly improving
adaptability to complex obstacle distributions. Experiments show that under a
baseline configuration with one thousand sampled vertices, the path length of
A-star PRM is 1073.23 plus or minus 14.8 meters and is 42.3 percent shorter
than that of PRM with p value less than 0.01. With high-density sampling using
three thousand vertices, the path length is reduced by 0.94 percent, 1036.61
meters compared with 1046.42 meters, while the increase in computational time
is cut to about one tenth of the PRM increase, 71 percent compared with 785
percent. These results confirm the comprehensive advantages of A-star PRM in
path quality, stability, and computational efficiency. Compared with existing
hybrid algorithms, the proposed method shows clear benefits, especially in

Abstract: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is a foundational technique for autonomous
systems, yet its deployment on resource-constrained platforms remains
challenging due to computational and memory limitations. We propose Super-LIO,
a robust LIO system that demands both high performance and accuracy, ideal for
applications such as aerial robots and mobile autonomous systems. At the core
of Super-LIO is a compact octo-voxel-based map structure, termed OctVox, that
limits each voxel to eight fused subvoxels, enabling strict point density
control and incremental denoising during map updates. This design enables a
simple yet efficient and accurate map structure, which can be easily integrated
into existing LIO frameworks. Additionally, Super-LIO designs a
heuristic-guided KNN strategy (HKNN) that accelerates the correspondence search
by leveraging spatial locality, further reducing runtime overhead. We evaluated
the proposed system using four publicly available datasets and several
self-collected datasets, totaling more than 30 sequences. Extensive testing on
both X86 and ARM platforms confirms that Super-LIO offers superior efficiency
and robustness, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Super-LIO processes
each frame approximately 73% faster than SOTA, while consuming less CPU
resources. The system is fully open-source and plug-and-play compatible with a
wide range of LiDAR sensors and platforms. The implementation is available at:

Abstract: Game-based interactive driving simulations have emerged as versatile
platforms for advancing decision-making algorithms in road transport mobility.
While these environments offer safe, scalable, and engaging settings for
testing driving strategies, ensuring both realism and robust performance amid
dynamic and diverse scenarios remains a significant challenge. Recently, the
integration of game-based techniques with advanced learning frameworks has
enabled the development of adaptive decision-making models that effectively
manage the complexities inherent in varied driving conditions. These models
outperform traditional simulation methods, especially when addressing
scenario-specific challenges, ranging from obstacle avoidance on highways and
precise maneuvering during on-ramp merging to navigation in roundabouts,
unsignalized intersections, and even the high-speed demands of autonomous
racing. Despite numerous innovations in game-based interactive driving, a
systematic review comparing these approaches across different scenarios is
still missing. This survey provides a comprehensive evaluation of game-based
interactive driving methods by summarizing recent advancements and inherent
roadway features in each scenario. Furthermore, the reviewed algorithms are
critically assessed based on their adaptation of the standard game model and an
analysis of their specific mechanisms to understand their impact on
decision-making performance. Finally, the survey discusses the limitations of
current approaches and outlines promising directions for future research.

Abstract: The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively
studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object
detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly
adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale
perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,
accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In
this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator
for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid
board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in
eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and
efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be
accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization
is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The
results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can
achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The
implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on

embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art

Abstract: With the rapid development of the warehousing and logistics industries, the
packing of goods has gradually attracted the attention of academia and
industry. The packing of footwear products is a typical representative
paired-item packing task involving irregular shapes and deformable objects.
Although studies on shoe packing have been conducted, different initial states
due to the irregular shapes of shoes and standard packing placement poses have
not been considered. This study proposes a robotic manipulation framework,
including a perception module, reorientation planners, and a packing planner,
that can complete the packing of pairs of shoes in any initial state. First, to
adapt to the large intraclass variations due to the state, shape, and
deformation of the shoe, we propose a vision module based on semantic
keypoints, which can also infer more information such as size, state, pose, and
manipulation points by combining geometric features. Subsequently, we not only
proposed primitive-based reorientation methods for different states of a single
deformable shoe but also proposed a fast reorientation method for the top state
using box edge contact and gravity, which further improved the efficiency of
reorientation. Finally, based on the perception module and reorientation
methods, we propose a task planner for shoe pair packing in any initial state
to provide an optimal packing strategy. Real-world experiments were conducted
to verify the robustness of the reorientation methods and the effectiveness of
the packing strategy for various types of shoes. In this study, we highlight
the potential of semantic keypoint representation methods, introduce new
perspectives on the reorientation of 3D deformable objects and multi-object
manipulation, and provide a reference for paired object packing.

approach combines the responsiveness of local HMD SLAM tracking with the
flexibility to realign to an external source when needed. It also supports
real-time pose sharing across devices, ensuring consistent spatial alignment
and engagement between users. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework
achieves the spatial accuracy required for natural multi-user interaction while
offering improved comfort, scalability, and robustness over existing co-located
VR solutions.

TL;DR: 提出OMEPP问题解决移动机器人在拾取物体过程中的能耗优化路径规划，通过并发PCPD搜索算法实现近最优解且计算效率提升1-2个数量级


<details>

Motivation: 现有能耗优化路径规划研究忽略了实际场景中机器人需要中途拾取物体的情况，而拾取动作会因负载变化显著影响能耗，需要新的解决方案

Method: 提出基线算法使用Z*算法迭代访问每个拾取点，然后开发并发PCPD搜索算法，通过Payload-Constrained Path Database同时管理多个Z*搜索，降低分支因子

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，并发PCPD搜索算法虽然可能产生略微次优解，但能达到接近最优的性能，同时比基线算法快1-2个数量级

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) operate on battery power, making energy
efficiency a critical consideration, particularly in outdoor environments where
terrain variations affect energy consumption. While prior research has
primarily focused on computing energy-efficient paths from a source to a
destination, these approaches often overlook practical scenarios where a robot
needs to pick up an object en route - an action that can significantly impact
energy consumption due to changes in payload. This paper introduces the
Object-Pickup Minimum Energy Path Problem (OMEPP), which addresses
energy-efficient route planning for AMRs required to pick up an object from one
of many possible locations and deliver it to a destination. To address OMEPP,
we first introduce a baseline algorithm that employs the Z star algorithm, a
variant of A star tailored for energy-efficient routing, to iteratively visit
each pickup point. While this approach guarantees optimality, it suffers from
high computational cost due to repeated searches at each pickup location. To
mitigate this inefficiency, we propose a concurrent PCPD search that manages
multiple Z star searches simultaneously across all pickup points. Central to
our solution is the Payload-Constrained Path Database (PCPD), an extension of
the Compressed Path Database (CPD) that incorporates payload constraints. We
demonstrate that PCPD significantly reduces branching factors during search,
improving overall performance. Although the concurrent PCPD search may produce
slightly suboptimal solutions, extensive experiments on real-world datasets
show it achieves near-optimal performance while being one to two orders of
magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm.

Motivation: 现有路径规划方法通常假设单一运动模型，无法充分利用4WIS平台的多模态运动能力

Method: 构建四维状态空间（空间坐标+运动模式），设计多模态Reeds-Shepp曲线，改进启发函数考虑模式切换成本，使用智能模式选择策略确保平滑过渡

Result: 在复杂环境中显著提升了4WIS机器人的规划性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够在单个路径中无缝集成多种运动模式，大大提高了机器人在复杂环境中的灵活性和适应性

Abstract: Four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) systems provide mobile robots with a
rich set of motion modes, such as Ackermann steering, lateral steering, and
parallel movement, offering superior maneuverability in constrained
environments. However, existing path planning methods generally assume a single
kinematic model and thus fail to fully exploit the multi-modal capabilities of
4WIS platforms. To address this limitation, we propose an extended Hybrid A*
framework that operates in a four-dimensional state space incorporating both
spatial states and motion modes. Within this framework, we design multi-modal
Reeds-Shepp curves tailored to the distinct kinematic constraints of each
motion mode, develop an enhanced heuristic function that accounts for
mode-switching costs, and introduce a terminal connection strategy with
intelligent mode selection to ensure smooth transitions between different
steering patterns. The proposed planner enables seamless integration of
multiple motion modalities within a single path, significantly improving
flexibility and adaptability in complex environments. Results demonstrate
significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex
environments.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的IEEE 802.11兼容混合TDMA/CSMA协议，解决高测试测试负载下CSMA协议的严重性能降级问题，实现了73%的过期误差降低和90%的轨迹误差减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器人技术在制造业、医疗健康和自主系统中的进步，对实时控制的需求日益增长。任务关键交通需要在定义的QoS期限内到达，运行效果和安全性依赖于定时命令交付。CSMA协议在高测试负载下存在严重的冲突和延迟问题。

Result: 在实时SDR平台和ROS模拟中进行了模拟实验，结果显示：与CSMA基准线相比，提出的协议减少83%的过期误差；在高速路径跟踪ROS模拟中，根均方根轨迹误差降低了90%；同时非关键交通的通信速率保持在±2%的范围内。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一种高效的混合协议，能够在异构机器人交通环境中提供可靠的任务关键命令传输，显著提升了控制系统的性能和稳定性，为实时机器人应用提供了重要的通信基础。

Abstract: Recent progress in robotics has underscored the demand for real-time control
in applications such as manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous systems,
where the timely delivery of mission-critical commands under heterogeneous
robotic traffic is paramount for operational efficacy and safety. In these
scenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained
communication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines,
otherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control loops.In
this work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted
in robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic
loads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time
arrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an
IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's
deterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot
traffic.The protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical
command delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic
integration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for
establishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic
TDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV
protection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from
interference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot
Operating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces
missed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed
robot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS)
trajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while
maintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object
shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In
this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset
from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy
can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot
to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed
during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the
object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the
number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several
real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer,
and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by
investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we
show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for
data augmentation.

Motivation: 开环抓取方法在受控环境中有效，但在杂乱环境中表现不佳，主要由于抓取预测误差和物体姿态变化。现有闭环方法只能在简化设置中处理有限物体，缺乏泛化能力。

Conclusion: Grasp-MPC通过结合学习价值函数和MPC框架，实现了在杂乱环境中对新物体的鲁棒和反应式抓取，显著提高了抓取性能。

Abstract: Grasping of diverse objects in unstructured environments remains a
significant challenge. Open-loop grasping methods, effective in controlled
settings, struggle in cluttered environments. Grasp prediction errors and
object pose changes during grasping are the main causes of failure. In
contrast, closed-loop methods address these challenges in simplified settings
(e.g., single object on a table) on a limited set of objects, with no path to
generalization. We propose Grasp-MPC, a closed-loop 6-DoF vision-based grasping
policy designed for robust and reactive grasping of novel objects in cluttered
environments. Grasp-MPC incorporates a value function, trained on visual
observations from a large-scale synthetic dataset of 2 million grasp
trajectories that include successful and failed attempts. We deploy this
learned value function in an MPC framework in combination with other cost terms
that encourage collision avoidance and smooth execution. We evaluate Grasp-MPC
on FetchBench and real-world settings across diverse environments. Grasp-MPC
improves grasp success rates by up to 32.6% in simulation and 33.3% in
real-world noisy conditions, outperforming open-loop, diffusion policy,
transformer policy, and IQL approaches. Videos and more at

Abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it
establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting
objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object
affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve
relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge
of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints.
Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation
models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning
approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation
models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding
enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel
objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation
with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly
enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions
when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D
object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that
our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both
accuracy and generalization capability.

Conclusion: 该适应性覆盖控制框架有效解决了农业环境中的动态挑战，为UGV在复杂地形和移动障碍物环境中的自主工作提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive coverage control method for a fleet of
off-road and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) operating in dynamic
(time-varying) agricultural environments. Traditional coverage control
approaches often assume static conditions, making them unsuitable for
real-world farming scenarios where obstacles, such as moving machinery and
uneven terrains, create continuous challenges. To address this, we propose a
real-time path planning framework that integrates Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) for obstacle detection and terrain assessment, allowing UGVs to
dynamically adjust their coverage paths. The environment is modeled as a
weighted directed graph, where the edge weights are continuously updated based
on the UAV observations to reflect obstacle motion and terrain variations. The
proposed approach incorporates Voronoi-based partitioning, adaptive edge weight
assignment, and cost-based path optimization to enhance navigation efficiency.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
improving path planning, reducing traversal costs, and maintaining robust
coverage in the presence of dynamic obstacles and muddy terrains.

Conclusion: DCReg通过系统性处理病态配准问题，提供了更可靠、高效和物理可解释的解决方案，显著提升了在退化环境中的配准性能。

Abstract: LiDAR point cloud registration is fundamental to robotic perception and
navigation. However, in geometrically degenerate or narrow environments,
registration problems become ill-conditioned, leading to unstable solutions and
degraded accuracy. While existing approaches attempt to handle these issues,
they fail to address the core challenge: accurately detection, interpret, and
resolve this ill-conditioning, leading to missed detections or corrupted
solutions. In this study, we introduce DCReg, a principled framework that
systematically addresses the ill-conditioned registration problems through
three integrated innovations. First, DCReg achieves reliable ill-conditioning
detection by employing a Schur complement decomposition to the hessian matrix.
This technique decouples the registration problem into clean rotational and
translational subspaces, eliminating coupling effects that mask degeneracy
patterns in conventional analyses. Second, within these cleanly subspaces, we
develop quantitative characterization techniques that establish explicit
mappings between mathematical eigenspaces and physical motion directions,
providing actionable insights about which specific motions lack constraints.
Finally, leveraging this clean subspace, we design a targeted mitigation
strategy: a novel preconditioner that selectively stabilizes only the
identified ill-conditioned directions while preserving all well-constrained
information in observable space. This enables efficient and robust optimization
via the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method with a single physical
interpretable parameter. Extensive experiments demonstrate DCReg achieves at
least 20% - 50% improvement in localization accuracy and 5-100 times speedup
over state-of-the-art methods across diverse environments. Our implementation
will be available at https://github.com/JokerJohn/DCReg.

Abstract: Deploying self-navigating surface vessels in inland waterways offers a
sustainable alternative to reduce road traffic congestion and emissions.
However, navigating confined waterways presents unique challenges, including
narrow channels, higher traffic density, and hydrodynamic disturbances.
Existing methods for autonomous vessel navigation often lack the robustness or
precision required for such environments. This paper presents a new motion
planning approach for Automated Surface Vessels (ASVs) using Robust Model
Predictive Control (RMPC) combined with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). By
incorporating channel borders and obstacles as safety constraints within the
control design framework, the proposed method ensures both collision avoidance
and robust navigation on complex waterways. Simulation results demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed method in safely guiding ASVs under realistic
conditions, highlighting its improved safety and adaptability compared to the
state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Traditional RL-based locomotion controllers often suffer from low data
efficiency, requiring extensive interaction to achieve robust performance. We
present a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that improves
sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion by appending synthetic data to the
end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following the Dyna-Style
paradigm. A predictive model, trained alongside the policy, generates
short-horizon synthetic transitions that are gradually integrated using a
scheduling strategy based on the policy update iterations. Through an ablation
study, we identified a strong correlation between sample efficiency and rollout
length, which guided the design of our experiments. We validated our approach
in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot and showed that replacing part of the
simulated steps with synthetic ones not only mimics extended rollouts but also
improves policy return and reduces variance. Finally, we demonstrate that this
improvement transfers to the ability to track a wide range of locomotion
commands using fewer simulated steps.

Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both
simulated and real-world settings. Video results and code available at

Abstract: Legged robots must achieve both robust locomotion and energy efficiency to be
practical in real-world environments. Yet controllers trained in simulation
often fail to transfer reliably, and most existing approaches neglect
actuator-specific energy losses or depend on complex, hand-tuned reward
formulations. We propose a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement
learning with a physics-grounded energy model for permanent magnet synchronous
motors. The framework requires a minimal parameter set to capture the
simulation-to-reality gap and employs a compact four-term reward with a
first-principle-based energetic loss formulation that balances electrical and
mechanical dissipation. We evaluate and validate the approach through a
bottom-up dynamic parameter identification study, spanning actuators,
full-robot in-air trajectories and on-ground locomotion. The framework is
tested on three primary platforms and deployed on ten additional robots,
demonstrating reliable policy transfer without randomization of dynamic
parameters. Our method improves energetic efficiency over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 32 percent reduction in the full Cost of Transport of
ANYmal (value 1.27). All code, models, and datasets will be released.

Conclusion: ERPF方法为复杂交互驾驶环境提供了鲁棒且自适应的解决方案，有效克服了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: In recent years, ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort in interactive
autonomous driving has become a critical challenge. Traditional model-based
techniques, such as game-theoretic methods and robust control, are often overly
conservative or computationally intensive. Conversely, learning-based
approaches typically require extensive training data and frequently exhibit
limited interpretability and generalizability. Simpler strategies, such as Risk
Potential Fields (RPF), provide lightweight alternatives with minimal data
demands but are inherently static and struggle to adapt effectively to dynamic
traffic conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Evolutionary
Risk Potential Field (ERPF), a novel approach that dynamically updates risk
assessments in dynamical scenarios based on historical obstacle proximity data.
We introduce a Risk-Ellipse construct that combines longitudinal reach and
lateral uncertainty into a unified spatial temporal collision envelope.
Additionally, we define an adaptive Evolution Factor metric, computed through
sigmoid normalization of Time to Collision (TTC) and Time-Window-of-Hazard
(TWH), which dynamically adjusts the dimensions of the ellipse axes in real
time. This adaptive risk metric is integrated seamlessly into a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework, enabling autonomous vehicles to proactively
address complex interactive driving scenarios in terms of uncertain driving of
surrounding vehicles. Comprehensive comparative experiments demonstrate that
our ERPF-MPC approach consistently achieves smoother trajectories, higher
average speeds, and collision-free navigation, offering a robust and adaptive
solution suitable for complex interactive driving environments.

Result: 在Jetson Nano上的硬件在环实验显示，BAN-MPC比传统MPC快200倍，能够在模型参数变化15%的情况下实现无碰撞导航，控制误差低于5%。

Conclusion: BAN-MPC是一种有效的嵌入式MPC替代方案，无需重新训练即可适应模型参数变化，显著降低了离线和在线计算成本。

Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) enforces safety via constraints, its
real-time execution can exceed embedded compute budgets. We propose a
Barrier-integrated Adaptive Neural Model Predictive Control (BAN-MPC) framework
that synergizes neural networks' fast computation with MPC's
constraint-handling capability. To ensure strict safety, we replace traditional
Euclidean distance with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for collision
avoidance. We integrate an offline-learned neural value function into the
optimization objective of a Short-horizon MPC, substantially reducing online
computational complexity. Additionally, we use a second neural network to learn
the sensitivity of the value function to system parameters, and adaptively
adjust the neural value function based on this neural sensitivity when model
parameters change, eliminating the need for retraining and reducing offline
computation costs. The hardware in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on Jetson Nano
show that BAN-MPC solves 200 times faster than traditional MPC, enabling
collision-free navigation with control error below 5\% under model parameter
variations within 15\%, making it an effective embedded MPC alternative.

Conclusion: 该系统通过无缝集成照片实际映射生成与实时性能，最终提升了在不熟悉环境中的远程遥操效果

Abstract: Achieving efficient remote teleoperation is particularly challenging in
unknown environments, as the teleoperator must rapidly build an understanding
of the site's layout. Online 3D mapping is a proven strategy to tackle this
challenge, as it enables the teleoperator to progressively explore the site
from multiple perspectives. However, traditional online map-based teleoperation
systems struggle to generate visually accurate 3D maps in real-time due to the
high computational cost involved, leading to poor teleoperation performances.
In this work, we propose a solution to improve teleoperation efficiency in
unknown environments. Our approach proposes a novel, modular and efficient
GPU-based integration between recent advancement in gaussian splatting SLAM and
existing online map-based teleoperation systems. We compare the proposed
solution against state-of-the-art teleoperation systems and validate its
performances through real-world experiments using an aerial vehicle. The
results show significant improvements in decision-making speed and more
accurate interaction with the environment, leading to greater teleoperation
efficiency. In doing so, our system enhances remote teleoperation by seamlessly
integrating photorealistic mapping generation with real-time performances,
enabling effective teleoperation in unfamiliar environments.

Abstract: Autonomous manipulation of granular media, such as sand, is crucial for
applications in construction, excavation, and additive manufacturing. However,
shaping granular materials presents unique challenges due to their
high-dimensional configuration space and complex dynamics, where traditional
rule-based approaches struggle without extensive engineering efforts.
Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling agents
to learn adaptive manipulation strategies through trial and error. In this
work, we present an RL framework that enables a robotic arm with a cubic
end-effector and a stereo camera to shape granular media into desired target
structures. We show the importance of compact observations and concise reward
formulations for the large configuration space, validating our design choices
with an ablation study. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach for the training of visual policies that manipulate granular
media including their real-world deployment, outperforming two baseline
approaches.

Result: ED-CBBA在保持与CBBA相同解质量的同时，消息传输量最多减少52%

Conclusion: 事件驱动通信机制能有效解决多机器人系统中的通信挑战，显著降低通信开销

Abstract: In various scenarios such as multi-drone surveillance and search-and-rescue
operations, deploying multiple robots is essential to accomplish multiple tasks
at once. Due to the limited communication range of these vehicles, a
decentralised task allocation algorithm is crucial for effective task
distribution among robots. The consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA) has been
promising for multi-robot operation, offering theoretical guarantees. However,
CBBA demands continuous communication, leading to potential congestion and
packet loss that can hinder performance. In this study, we introduce an
event-driven communication mechanism designed to address these communication
challenges while maintaining the convergence and performance bounds of CBBA. We
demonstrate theoretically that the solution quality matches that of CBBA and
validate the approach with Monte-Carlo simulations across varying targets,
agents, and bundles. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm (ED-CBBA) can
reduce message transmissions by up to 52%.

Conclusion: 该方法能够以相同配置在不同场景中工作，证明了其强大的适应性和稳健性，并已开源以便社区使用

Abstract: Accurate odometry is a critical component in a robotic navigation stack, and
subsequent modules such as planning and control often rely on an estimate of
the robot's motion. Sensor-based odometry approaches should be robust across
sensor types and deployable in different target domains, from solid-state
LiDARs mounted on cars in urban-driving scenarios to spinning LiDARs on
handheld packages used in unstructured natural environments. In this paper, we
propose a robust LiDAR-inertial odometry system that does not rely on
sensor-specific modeling. Sensor fusion techniques for LiDAR and inertial
measurement unit (IMU) data typically integrate IMU data iteratively in a
Kalman filter or use pre-integration in a factor graph framework, combined with
LiDAR scan matching often exploiting some form of feature extraction. We
propose an alternative strategy that only requires a simplified motion model
for IMU integration and directly registers LiDAR scans in a scan-to-map
approach. Our approach allows us to impose a novel regularization on the LiDAR
registration, improving the overall odometry performance. We detail extensive
experiments on a number of datasets covering a wide array of commonly used
robotic sensors and platforms. We show that our approach works with the exact
same configuration in all these scenarios, demonstrating its robustness. We
have open-sourced our implementation so that the community can build further on
our work and use it in their navigation stacks.

Motivation: 工业环境中协作机器人日益普及，但缺乏高质量的真实人机交互数据集（包括危险事件）阻碍了安全系统的发展。

Method: 通过结合3D LiDAR点云、人体关键点检测和机器人关节状态，捕捉人机协作的完整空间和动态上下文，提供多模态数据集。

Result: 创建了包含4431个标注点云的LiHRA数据集，涵盖6种代表性HRI场景（协作共存任务、物体交接、表面抛光等），并开发了基于上下文信息的风险量化方法。

Conclusion: LiHRA为实时风险监测和自适应安全策略研究提供了重要基础，其高分辨率LiDAR数据、精确人体追踪和真实碰撞事件使其成为训练和评估风险监测算法的宝贵资源。

Abstract: We present LiHRA, a novel dataset designed to facilitate the development of
automated, learning-based, or classical risk monitoring (RM) methods for
Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios. The growing prevalence of
collaborative robots in industrial environments has increased the need for
reliable safety systems. However, the lack of high-quality datasets that
capture realistic human-robot interactions, including potentially dangerous
events, slows development. LiHRA addresses this challenge by providing a
comprehensive, multi-modal dataset combining 3D LiDAR point clouds, human body
keypoints, and robot joint states, capturing the complete spatial and dynamic
context of human-robot collaboration. This combination of modalities allows for
precise tracking of human movement, robot actions, and environmental
conditions, enabling accurate RM during collaborative tasks. The LiHRA dataset
covers six representative HRI scenarios involving collaborative and coexistent
tasks, object handovers, and surface polishing, with safe and hazardous
versions of each scenario. In total, the data set includes 4,431 labeled point
clouds recorded at 10 Hz, providing a rich resource for training and
benchmarking classical and AI-driven RM algorithms. Finally, to demonstrate
LiHRA's utility, we introduce an RM method that quantifies the risk level in
each scenario over time. This method leverages contextual information,
including robot states and the dynamic model of the robot. With its combination
of high-resolution LiDAR data, precise human tracking, robot state data, and
realistic collision events, LiHRA offers an essential foundation for future
research into real-time RM and adaptive safety strategies in human-robot
workspaces.

Abstract: Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide
range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual
operation or untransportable railway for movement. The AgriVLN method and the
A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the
agricultural domain, enabling agents navigate to the target position following
the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple
instructions, however, often misunderstands the complicated instructions. To
bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic
Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction
Translator module translates the original instruction to be both refined and
precise. Being evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively
improves SR from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces NE from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating
the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain. Code:

mitigation strategies. User studies (n = 30) demonstrated the effectiveness of
the system in anomaly detection with 91.2% prediction accuracy and relatively
low latency response times using edge-ai architecture.

Abstract: Learning-based controllers, such as diffusion policies and vision-language
action models, often generate low-frequency or discontinuous robot state
changes. Achieving smooth reference tracking requires a low-level controller
that converts high-level targets commands into joint torques, enabling
compliant behavior during contact interactions. We present CRISP, a lightweight
C++ implementation of compliant Cartesian and joint-space controllers for the
ROS2 control standard, designed for seamless integration with high-level
learning-based policies as well as teleoperation. The controllers are
compatible with any manipulator that exposes a joint-torque interface. Through
our Python and Gymnasium interfaces, CRISP provides a unified pipeline for
recording data from hardware and simulation and deploying high-level
learning-based policies seamlessly, facilitating rapid experimentation. The
system has been validated on hardware with the Franka Robotics FR3 and in
simulation with the Kuka IIWA14 and Kinova Gen3. Designed for rapid
integration, flexible deployment, and real-time performance, our implementation
provides a unified pipeline for data collection and policy execution, lowering
the barrier to applying learning-based methods on ROS2-compatible manipulators.

Abstract: Micro Autonomous Surface Vehicles (MicroASVs) offer significant potential for
operations in confined or shallow waters and swarm robotics applications.
However, achieving precise and robust control at such small scales remains
highly challenging, mainly due to the complexity of modeling nonlinear
hydrodynamic forces and the increased sensitivity to self-motion effects and
environmental disturbances, including waves and boundary effects in confined
spaces. This paper presents a physics-driven dynamics model for an
over-actuated MicroASV and introduces a data-driven optimal control framework
that leverages a weak formulation-based online model learning method. Our
approach continuously refines the physics-driven model in real time, enabling
adaptive control that adjusts to changing system parameters. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method substantially enhances trajectory tracking
accuracy and robustness, even under unknown payloads and external disturbances.
These findings highlight the potential of data-driven online learning-based
optimal control to improve MicroASV performance, paving the way for more
reliable and precise autonomous surface vehicle operations.

Abstract: The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has
inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic
manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from
autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in
text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a
series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for
robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present
LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon
pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to
robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token
classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with
special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a
hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences
hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.

Abstract: Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a
central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,
and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to
synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive
evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1
consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in
both task success rate and generalization ability.

Abstract: The rise of distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning has sparked
interest in decentralized gradient marketplaces, where participants trade
intermediate artifacts like gradients. However, existing Federated Learning
(FL) benchmarks overlook critical economic and systemic factors unique to such
marketplaces-cost-effectiveness, fairness to sellers, and market
stability-especially when a buyer relies on a private baseline dataset for

  We introduce a comprehensive benchmark framework to holistically evaluate
robust gradient aggregation methods within these buyer-baseline-reliant
marketplaces. Our contributions include: (1) a simulation environment modeling
marketplace dynamics with a variable buyer baseline and diverse seller
distributions; (2) an evaluation methodology augmenting standard FL metrics
with marketplace-centric dimensions such as Economic Efficiency, Fairness, and
Selection Dynamics; (3) an in-depth empirical analysis of the existing
Distributed Gradient Marketplace framework, MartFL, including the integration
and comparative evaluation of adapted FLTrust and SkyMask as alternative
aggregation strategies within it. This benchmark spans diverse datasets, local
attacks, and Sybil attacks targeting the marketplace selection process; and (4)
actionable insights into the trade-offs between model performance, robustness,
cost, fairness, and stability.
  This benchmark equips the community with essential tools and empirical
evidence to evaluate and design more robust, equitable, and economically viable
decentralized gradient marketplaces.

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统性评估了LLM反学习领域的常见实践，发现依赖单一邻近集和标准采样方法存在问题，并提出了包含多样化邻近集和模块化实体级反学习策略的最佳实践方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM反学习研究中常见使用单一邻近集和标准采样方法，这些方法的效果和稳定性未经过严格评估，且无法反映真实世界数据的复杂性和关系。

Method: 系统性评估了常见的反学习实践，包括采样方法和邻近集设置，并基于分析结果提出了模块化实体级反学习(MELU)策略作为替代方案。

Result: 研究发现依赖单一邻近集是次优的，标准1:1采样方法效率低下且效果差，而提出的MELU策略给出了明确且稳定的反学习路径。

Conclusion: 通过采用多样化邻近集和模块化实体级反学习策略，可以更有效地平衡知识删除效果和模型使用效果，为LLM反学习领域提供更优秀的实践方案。

Abstract: A conventional LLM Unlearning setting consists of two subsets -"forget" and
"retain", with the objectives of removing the undesired knowledge from the
forget set while preserving the remaining knowledge from the retain. In
privacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into
neighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget
targets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in
existing benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general
knowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and
relationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic
iteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto
standards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically
evaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single
neighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure
performance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an
initial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to
balance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods
are inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level
Unlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling. We demonstrate
that this modular approach, combined with robust algorithms, provides a clear
and stable path towards effective unlearning.

Result: 在多种CLIP背榜模型上进行了广泛实验，结果显示该方法能够一致地提升下游任务的ID细调性能和OOD稳健性，超越了现有的正则化基于稳健细调方法

Conclusion: 通过直接在函数空间中约束模型的优化，而不仅仅是保留权重或特征，可以更有效地保持预训练模型的OOD稳健性，为稳健细调提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

*Jie Fu,Hong Yuan,Zhili Chen,Wendy Hui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图神经网络中的拓扑隐私风险，提出了拓扑推理攻击(TIAs)并发现现有隐私保护机制不足，进而开发了Private Graph Reconstruction(PGR)防御框架来保护拓扑隐私同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络(GNNs)在处理图结构数据时面临严重的隐私问题，现有研究主要关注边级隐私，而拓扑隐私(图整体结构的机密性)这一关键威胁尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了拓扑推理攻击(TIAs)来重建目标训练图结构，并开发了Private Graph Reconstruction(PGR)防御框架，采用双层优化方法：使用元梯度迭代生成合成训练图，同时基于演化图更新GNN模型。

Result: 研究发现GNNs对这些攻击高度脆弱，现有边级差分隐私机制要么无法缓解风险，要么严重损害模型精度。PGR框架显著减少了拓扑信息泄露，同时对模型精度影响最小。

Conclusion: 拓扑隐私是GNNs中一个被忽视但重要的安全问题，需要专门的防御机制。PGR框架为保护图结构隐私提供了有效解决方案，在保持模型性能的同时增强了隐私保护。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning
from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised
serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on
edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology
privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work,
we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing
their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a
suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure
of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our
findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that
existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they
either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To
address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a
novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining
model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a
synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the
GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with
minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is anonymously available at
https://github.com/JeffffffFu/PGR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了memTrace框架，通过分析LLM内部表示（隐藏状态和注意力模式）而非仅输出，来检测成员推理攻击，在多个模型上达到0.85的平均AUC分数，表明即使输出信号看似安全，内部行为仍可能泄露训练数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明成员推理攻击对大型语言模型效果仅略优于随机猜测，认为现代预训练方法可能免于隐私泄露风险。本文旨在探索通过分析模型内部表示而非仅输出来发现潜在的成员推理信号。

Method: 提出memTrace框架，通过分析transformer隐藏状态和注意力模式的"神经痕迹"，包括层级表示动态、注意力分布特征和跨层转换模式，检测传统基于损失的方法可能无法捕获的记忆指纹。

Result: 在多个模型系列上实现了强大的成员检测能力，在流行的MIA基准测试中达到平均0.85的AUC分数，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 模型内部行为即使在输出信号看似受保护的情况下仍能揭示训练数据暴露的方面，强调需要进一步研究成员隐私并开发更强大的隐私保护训练技术。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) reveal whether specific data was used to
train machine learning models, serving as important tools for privacy auditing
and compliance assessment. Recent studies have reported that MIAs perform only
marginally better than random guessing against large language models,
suggesting that modern pre-training approaches with massive datasets may be
free from privacy leakage risks. Our work offers a complementary perspective to
these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations,
rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential
membership inference signals. Our framework, \emph{memTrace}, follows what we
call \enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from
transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate
sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention
distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect
potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may
not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several
model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks.
Our findings suggest that internal model behaviors can reveal aspects of
training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected,
highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and the
development of more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for large
language models.

TL;DR: Spotify提出基于情境多臂老虎机的校准方法，根据用户上下文动态学习最优内容类型分布，解决历史数据偏向音乐的问题，提升播客等弱势内容的用户参与度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spotify首页内容类型不平衡，历史数据严重偏向音乐，难以提供个性化的内容组合。用户对不同内容类型的偏好会随时间、设备和情境变化

Method: 使用情境多臂老虎机（contextual bandits）动态学习每个用户在特定情境下的最优内容类型分布，替代依赖历史平均值的传统校准方法

Result: 离线和在线实验结果均显示，该方法提高了首页内容的精准度和用户参与度，特别是对播客等代表性不足的内容类型有显著改善

Conclusion: 基于情境多臂老虎机的动态校准方法能有效适应用户兴趣在不同情境下的变化，提升内容推荐的平衡性和个性化效果

Abstract: Spotify's Home page features a variety of content types, including music,
podcasts, and audiobooks. However, historical data is heavily skewed toward
music, making it challenging to deliver a balanced and personalized content
mix. Moreover, users' preference towards different content types may vary
depending on the time of day, the day of week, or even the device they use. We
propose a calibration method that leverages contextual bandits to dynamically
learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and
preferences. Unlike traditional calibration methods that rely on historical
averages, our approach boosts engagement by adapting to how users interests in
different content types varies across contexts. Both offline and online results
demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page,
in particular with under-represented content types such as podcasts.

Result: 融合潜在表示产生更结构化的模式，而单独表示在特定情况下更有用

Conclusion: 融合潜在数据表示在大多数情况下能提供更好的分析效果，但单独表示在某些特定场景中仍有价值

Abstract: Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to
simulate, predict trends, and uncover complex patterns within cities. While
these data enables advanced analysis, it also presents challenges due to its
granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. To address these challenges,
visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent
representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a
street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore
the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each
data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this
work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused
latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in
uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals
that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while
separate ones are useful in particular cases.

TL;DR: PLanTS是一个周期性感知的自监督学习框架，通过多粒度分块机制和对比损失来建模多元时间序列的潜在状态和转换，在多个下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列具有高维度、标注数据有限和非平稳性等挑战，现有自监督学习方法忽略了内在周期性结构，无法捕捉潜在状态的动态演化。

Method: 提出周期性感知的多粒度分块机制和广义对比损失，设计下一个转换预测的预训练任务来编码未来状态演化的预测信息。

Result: 在多分类、多标签分类、预测、轨迹跟踪和异常检测等任务中，PLanTS始终优于现有自监督学习方法，且比基于DTW的方法具有更好的运行时效率。

Conclusion: PLanTS通过显式建模不规则潜在状态及其转换，有效提升了多元时间序列的表征质量，为时间序列分析提供了有效的自监督学习解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) are ubiquitous in domains such as healthcare,
climate science, and industrial monitoring, but their high dimensionality,
limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature pose significant challenges for
conventional machine learning methods. While recent self-supervised learning
(SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time
point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure
of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose
PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly
models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a
period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive
loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across
multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design
a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to
encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS
across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label
classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS
consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and
demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.

TL;DR: 利用信号时序逻辑(STL)规范来训练生物分子神经网络(BNNs)，解决生物系统中缺乏目标数据的训练挑战，实现回归和控制任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物分子神经网络具有通用函数逼近能力，但由于缺乏目标数据，训练BNNs仍然具有挑战性。需要一种方法来定义训练目标，使BNNs能够在生物系统中执行有用任务

Method: 基于信号时序逻辑(STL)的定量语义，提出梯度优化BNN权重的学习算法。使用STL规范定义训练目标，支持回归和控制任务，包括作为失调状态报告器和慢性疾病模型的反馈控制

Result: 数值实验表明，基于STL的学习方法能够高效解决所研究的回归和控制任务。BNNs成功学习了减少炎症同时避免对外部感染产生不良反应的控制策略

Conclusion: STL规范为训练生物分子神经网络提供了一种有效的替代方法，特别是在缺乏传统训练数据的情况下，使BNNs能够在生物系统中执行复杂的回归和控制功能

Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with
biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function
approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training
BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we
propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define
training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL,
enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a
learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in
biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in
which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback
control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease
model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to
external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based
learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of training data distribution on the
performance of image classification models. By analyzing the embeddings of the
training set, we propose a framework to understand the confidence of model
predictions on unseen data without the need for retraining. Our approach
filters out low-confidence predictions based on their distance from the
training distribution in the embedding space, significantly improving
classification accuracy. We demonstrate this on the example of several
classification models, showing consistent performance gains across
architectures. Furthermore, we show that using multiple embedding models to
represent the training data enables a more robust estimation of confidence, as
different embeddings capture complementary aspects of the data. Combining these
embeddings allows for better detection and exclusion of out-of-distribution
samples, resulting in further accuracy improvements. The proposed method is
model-agnostic and generalizable, with potential applications beyond computer
vision, including domains such as Natural Language Processing where prediction
reliability is critical.

Conclusion: 成功实现Mamba模型在资源受限微控制器的部署，为先进序列模型在嵌入式应用中的实际应用铺平道路

Abstract: Deploying Mamba models on microcontrollers (MCUs) remains challenging due to
limited memory, the lack of native operator support, and the absence of
embedded-friendly toolchains. We present, to our knowledge, the first
deployment of a Mamba-based neural architecture on a resource-constrained MCU,
a fully C-based runtime-free inference engine: MambaLite-Micro. Our pipeline
maps a trained PyTorch Mamba model to on-device execution by (1) exporting
model weights into a lightweight format, and (2) implementing a handcrafted
Mamba layer and supporting operators in C with operator fusion and memory
layout optimization. MambaLite-Micro eliminates large intermediate tensors,
reducing 83.0% peak memory, while maintaining an average numerical error of
only 1.7x10-5 relative to the PyTorch Mamba implementation. When evaluated on
keyword spotting(KWS) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks,
MambaLite-Micro achieved 100% consistency with the PyTorch baselines, fully
preserving classification accuracy. We further validated portability by
deploying on both ESP32S3 and STM32H7 microcontrollers, demonstrating
consistent operation across heterogeneous embedded platforms and paving the way
for bringing advanced sequence models like Mamba to real-world
resource-constrained applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了自对齐奖励(SAR)方法，通过相对困难度差值来补充二元正确性奖励，在提高准确性的同时降低30%的推理成本，实现了准确性和效率的希尔顿最优组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可验证奖励信号太粗糖，只能提供二元正确性反馈，导致推理过于繁琐和计算成本高，而现有解决方案往往会牺牲准确性。

Method: 提出自对齐奖励(SAR)，通过计算回答在查询条件下的相对困难度与独立回答的困难度差值，优先选择简洁且与查询相关的回答。

Result: 在4个模型和7个测试集上，SAR与PPO、GRPO等RL算法结合后提高了4%的准确性，同时降低30%的推理成本，实现了希尔顿最优。SAR能在保持高级推理能力的同时压缩不必要的详细说明。

Conclusion: SAR作为一种细粒度的自对齐奖励信号，有效补充了可验证奖励，为更高效、更有效的大语言模型训练抓基了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but such signals remain coarse,
offering only binary correctness feedback. This limitation often results in
inefficiencies, including overly verbose reasoning and high computational cost,
while existing solutions often compromise accuracy. To address this, we
introduce self-aligned reward (SAR), a self-guided signal that complements
verifiable rewards to encourage both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. SAR is
defined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on
the query and the standalone answer, thereby favoring responses that are
concise and query-specific. Quantitative analysis reveals that SAR reliably
distinguishes answer quality: concise, correct answers score higher than
redundant ones, and partially correct answers score higher than entirely
incorrect ones. Evaluation on 4 models across 7 benchmarks shows that
integrating SAR with prevalent RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO improves
accuracy by 4%, while reducing inference cost by 30%. Further analysis
demonstrates that SAR achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness
and efficiency compared to reward signals based on length or self-confidence.
We also show that SAR shortens responses while preserving advanced reasoning
behaviors, demonstrating its ability to suppress unnecessary elaboration
without losing critical reasoning. These results highlight the promise of
self-aligned reward as a fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards, paving
the way for more efficient and effective LLM training.

Conclusion: RLA框架为解决长时域目标条件任务中的分层强化学习问题提供了一个有理论保证、可扩展的解决方案，通过预期模型和价值几何一致性原则实现了稳定的分层规划与执行。

Abstract: Solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks remains a significant challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
addresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the
automatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joint training of multi-level
policies often suffer from instability and can lack theoretical guarantees. In
this paper, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), a
principled and potentially scalable framework designed to address these
limitations. The RLA agent learns two synergistic models: a low-level,
goal-conditioned policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a
high-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing
intermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The key feature of
RLA is the training of the anticipation model, which is guided by a principle
of value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions. We
present proofs that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various
conditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical
planning and execution in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型面临计算和内存瓶颈，传统压缩技术使用统一启发式方法，忽略了架构和运行时异质性，需要更智能的自动化压缩方案。

Method: 使用大型语言模型构建模块化多智能体系统，结合静态指标（MACs、参数量）和动态信号（延迟、内存）来分析每层瓶颈，设计架构特定的剪枝和动态量化策略。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上测试，剪枝保持竞争力或提升精度（ImageNet-1K下降约1%，小数据集上ViT-B/16提升2%），量化实现最高74%内存节省和<0.5%精度损失，推理速度提升1.74倍。

Conclusion: 智能体系统是可扩展的配置文件引导模型优化解决方案，LLM推理质量对迭代剪枝至关重要。

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架能够有效处理医学多模态表示学习中的偏差问题，提升模型泛化性能，为现有直接预测方法提供兼容性支持。

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous
clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive
modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data
mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from
missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints.
Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available
observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically
neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself.
In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization:
missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality
availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that
influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we
perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose
a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based
multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a
missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on
backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly
disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our
method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness and causal insights.

Conclusion: OptiProxy-NAS通过优化代理方法有效解决了NAS的离散优化问题，提供了高效且灵活的架构搜索解决方案。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hard computationally expensive
optimization problem with a discrete, vast, and spiky search space. One of the
key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via
certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent
predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture
search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the
NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In
particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be
continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable
optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed
architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$
search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural
language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the
superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity
scenarios verify the flexibility.

*Lucas Correia,Jan-Christoph Goos,Thomas Bäck,Anna V. Kononova*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于主动学习的无监督时间序列异常检测方法，通过新颖的DQS查询策略选择多样化样本进行标签查询，优化阈值选择，在少量标签预算下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督时间序列异常检测方法存在阈值设置不佳的问题，而声称无监督的方法往往需要标注数据进行校准，这在现实世界中往往不可得。

Method: 将主动学习集成到现有无监督异常检测方法中，通过提出的DQS（基于差异的查询策略）选择多变量时间序列标签进行查询，利用动态时间规整评估异常得分相似性来最大化查询样本的多样性。

Result: DQS在小预算场景下表现最佳，但其他策略在面对错误标注时更鲁棒。所有查询策略即使在存在错误标注的情况下也优于无监督阈值。

Conclusion: 在实际应用中，查询策略的选择取决于标注专家的专业水平和愿意标注的样本数量。只要能够查询专家，推荐使用基于主动学习的阈值方法。

Abstract: Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in
the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which
hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be
unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is
often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning
with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying
the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the
threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query
strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to
maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between
anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance
of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of
mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings
indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others
appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real
world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and
the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query
strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of
mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an
active learning-based threshold is recommended.

Conclusion: 图基建模在多模态学习中表现出色，GNN对差分隐私噪声引起的性能下降更具弹性，为隐私保护的联邦多模态学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains
challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled
examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning
approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network
latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses
privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still
has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and
differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal
Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse
sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple
accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through
residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via
attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused
embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy
safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that
the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with
up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and
federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed
under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses
MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on
the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of
graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to
the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.

Conclusion: 该分布式训练方法通过结合两种加速策略，有效解决了深度神经网络训练时间过长的问题，并可避免传统反向传播算法的锁定限制。

Abstract: Despite the notable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex
tasks, the training process still remains considerable challenges. A primary
obstacle is the substantial time required for training, particularly as high
performing DNNs tend to become increasingly deep (characterized by a larger
number of hidden layers) and require extensive training datasets. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a distributed training method that
integrates two prominent strategies for accelerating deep learning: data
parallelism and fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm. By
utilizing multiple computational units operating in parallel, the proposed
approach enhances the amount of training data processed in each iteration while
mitigating locking issues commonly associated with the backpropagation
algorithm. These features collectively contribute to significant improvements
in training efficiency. The proposed distributed training method is rigorously
proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions. Its
effectiveness is further demonstrated through empirical evaluations, wherein an
DNN is trained to perform classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Method: 将训练问题表述为凸函数之差(DC)形式，使用凸凹过程(CCP)迭代求解，产生一系列线性规划子问题

Result: 计算实验证明了所提出的训练方法在处理MPCL网络分类任务方面的有效性

Conclusion: CCP方法为训练不可微分的形态学感知器网络提供了一种有效的替代方案，能够成功解决多类分类任务

Abstract: A morphological perceptron is a multilayer feedforward neural network in
which neurons perform elementary operations from mathematical morphology. For
multiclass classification tasks, a morphological perceptron with a competitive
layer (MPCL) is obtained by integrating a winner-take-all output layer into the
standard morphological architecture. The non-differentiability of morphological
operators renders gradient-based optimization methods unsuitable for training
such networks. Consequently, alternative strategies that do not depend on
gradient information are commonly adopted. This paper proposes the use of the
convex-concave procedure (CCP) for training MPCL networks. The training problem
is formulated as a difference of convex (DC) functions and solved iteratively
using CCP, resulting in a sequence of linear programming subproblems.
Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
training method in addressing classification tasks with MPCL networks.

Abstract: How do we enable AI systems to efficiently learn in the real-world?
First-principles models are widely used to simulate natural systems, but often
fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions. In
contrast, deep learning approaches can estimate complex dynamics with minimal
assumptions but require large, representative datasets. We propose SimPEL, a
method that efficiently combines first-principles models with data-driven
learning by using low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning.
This enables SimPEL to benefit from simulator knowledge in low-data regimes and
leverage deep learning's flexibility when more data is available, all the while
carefully quantifying epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate SimPEL on diverse
systems, including biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, showing
superior performance in learning complex dynamics. For decision-making, we
demonstrate that SimPEL bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based
reinforcement learning. On a high-speed RC car task, SimPEL learns a highly
dynamic parking maneuver involving drifting with substantially less data than
state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of SimPEL for
data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Data collection is crucial for learning robust world models in model-based
reinforcement learning. The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect
trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or
training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning
task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for
effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on
world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been
thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both
paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different
environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline
counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of
offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This
issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,
offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between
the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We
demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online
interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of
online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that
incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of
offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data
when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on
expert data alone.

Abstract: Anomaly detection underpins critical applications from network security and
intrusion detection to fraud prevention, where recognizing aberrant patterns
rapidly is indispensable. Progress in this area is routinely impeded by two
obstacles: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. To combat
the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC)
classification trees and their ensemble extension, the PRC Random Forest
(PRC-RF). Building on that foundation, we now propose a hybrid framework that
integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that
learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges
simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior
accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods,
affirming its potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks.

Conclusion: SOOTT框架为不确定性下的在线决策提供了新思路，BEST和CoRT算法在实际应用中表现出良好的性能平衡和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT)
problem, a new framework that integrates three key objectives in online
decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a
dynamically moving target, (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding
unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt
changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as
elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must
balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden
demand spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust
algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT. To enhance practical
performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates
untrusted black-box predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision
process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves over BEST
when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary
prediction errors. We validate our approach through a case study on workload
scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory
tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.

Conclusion: DCV-ROOD框架为OOD检测方法提供了一种稳健、可靠的评估方法，通过分别处理ID和OOD数据的特性并考虑类别层次，实现了更准确的性能估计。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the
robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ
significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable
predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable
OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of
these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows
researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to
identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has
proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the
performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular
characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable
evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework
for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the
reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to
effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for
their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using
a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based
on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class
hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy
to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework.
This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution
Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we
selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without
outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast
convergence to the true performance.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic
systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing
solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target
variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into
the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to
promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two
challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the
target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and
future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a
novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in
\underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select,
then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated
expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent
space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized
sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which
recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into
dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs
are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic
balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency
of our proposed framework.

Conclusion: 大型时间序列Transformer具有可操控的、基于语义的表示，这证明了存在一个控制模型预测的潜在概念空间，将可解释性从事后归因转向直接因果干预，并支持战略性压力测试的语义"假设"分析。

Abstract: While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine
patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as
market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be
leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To
investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal
intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments
of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period)
during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts:
injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm
semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we
find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent
vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks.
Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and
Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically
grounded representations are a robust property of large time series
transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that
governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution
to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for
strategic stress-testing.

Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and
dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for
data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in
structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity
bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between
measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces
to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities
for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a
memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a
measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law
of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical
bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty
Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be
minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist
complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic
effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance
to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a
model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance
components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual
learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower
training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization
experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable,
theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.

Abstract: It is widely recognized in modern machine learning practice that access to a
diverse set of tasks can enhance performance across those tasks. This
observation suggests that, unlike in general multi-objective optimization, the
objectives in many real-world settings may not be inherently conflicting. To
address this, prior work introduced the Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization
(AMOO) framework and proposed gradient-based algorithms with provable
convergence guarantees. However, existing analysis relies on strong
assumptions, particularly strong convexity, which implies the existence of a
unique optimal solution. In this work, we relax this assumption and study
gradient-descent algorithms for convex AMOO under standard smoothness or
Lipschitz continuity conditions-assumptions more consistent with those used in
deep learning practice. This generalization requires new analytical tools and
metrics to characterize convergence in the convex AMOO setting. We develop such
tools, propose scalable algorithms for convex AMOO, and establish their
convergence guarantees. Additionally, we prove a novel lower bound that
demonstrates the suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to our
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究发现共形预测方法在捕捉数据固有歧义性（aleatoric uncertainty）方面效果有限，预测集大小与人类标注者标注的标签数量相关性很弱


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 共形预测声称能通过预测集大小捕捉数据的不确定性，但缺乏实证证据验证其有效性。本研究旨在检验共形预测是否能有效量化数据集中的类别重叠导致的固有歧义性

Method: 使用三种共形预测方法为8个深度学习模型生成预测集，在4个含多人标注的数据集上，测量预测集大小与人类标注者标注标签数量的相关性，并评估预测集与人类标注的相似性

Result: 绝大多数共形预测输出与人类标注呈现非常弱到弱的相关性，只有少数呈现中等相关性。虽然能提供更高的真实类别覆盖率，但捕捉固有歧义性的能力有限

Conclusion: 需要重新审视角形预测生成的预测集，虽然能保证较高的真实类别覆盖率，但在捕捉数据固有不确定性方面能力有限

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing
aleatoric uncertainty remains limited.

TL;DR: 通过在大规模社会科学实验数据集SocSci210上微调LLMs，显著提高了对人类行为反应的模拟准确性，在未见实验中的预测比基础模型提升26%，比GPT-4o提升13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLMs模拟社会科学实验结果，但现有模型在准确预测人类行为反应方面存在不足，需要通过在真实实验数据上微调来提升模拟准确性。

Method: 构建包含290万条响应、40万参与者的SocSci210数据集，使用Qwen2.5-14B作为基础模型进行微调，开发Socrates-Qwen-14B模型。

Result: 在完全未见研究中预测准确率提升26%，新条件泛化能力提升71%，人口统计偏差减少10.6%，超越GPT-4o表现13%。

Conclusion: 微调LLMs于社会科学实验数据能显著提升人类行为模拟准确性，为实验假设筛选提供更可靠的工具，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful opportunity to simulate the
results of social science experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that
finetuning LLMs directly on individual-level responses from past experiments
meaningfully improves the accuracy of such simulations across diverse social
science domains. We construct SocSci210 via an automatic pipeline, a dataset
comprising 2.9 million responses from 400,491 participants in 210 open-source
social science experiments. Through finetuning, we achieve multiple levels of
generalization. In completely unseen studies, our strongest model,
Socrates-Qwen-14B, produces predictions that are 26% more aligned with
distributions of human responses to diverse outcome questions under varying
conditions relative to its base model (Qwen2.5-14B), outperforming GPT-4o by
13%. By finetuning on a subset of conditions in a study, generalization to new
unseen conditions is particularly robust, improving by 71%. Since SocSci210
contains rich demographic information, we reduce demographic parity, a measure
of bias, by 10.6% through finetuning. Because social sciences routinely
generate rich, topic-specific datasets, our findings indicate that finetuning
on such data could enable more accurate simulations for experimental hypothesis
screening. We release our data, models and finetuning code at

Abstract: While queueing network models are powerful tools for analyzing service
systems, they traditionally require substantial human effort and domain
expertise to construct. To make this modeling approach more scalable and
accessible, we propose a data-driven framework for queueing network modeling
and simulation based on autoregressive sequence models trained on event-stream
data. Instead of explicitly specifying arrival processes, service mechanisms,
or routing logic, our approach learns the conditional distributions of event
types and event times, recasting the modeling task as a problem of sequence
distribution learning. We show that Transformer-style architectures can
effectively parameterize these distributions, enabling automated construction
of high-fidelity simulators. As a proof of concept, we validate our framework
on event tables generated from diverse queueing networks, showcasing its
utility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual
evaluation. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and the growing
availability of data, our framework takes a step toward more automated,
data-driven modeling pipelines to support broader adoption of queueing network
models across service domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了机器学习遗忘中的对抗性伪造问题，分析了ε-伪造集合的测度特性，证明在多种模型和数据分布下，随机采样伪造点的概率极小，表明对抗性伪造存在根本性限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受隐私法规和有害数据移除需求的驱动，机器学习遗忘旨在修改训练模型以有效"忘记"指定数据。验证遗忘的关键挑战是伪造问题——对抗性制作模仿目标点梯度的数据，造成已遗忘的假象而实际未移除信息。

Method: 提出了ε-伪造集合的分析框架，针对线性回归和单层神经网络，计算了该集合的Lebesgue测度。在一般正则性假设下，证明了伪造集合测度随ε^(d-r)/2衰减，其中d为数据维度，r为模型梯度变分矩阵的零度。

Result: 研究显示伪造集合的测度很小，按ε的量级缩放，当ε足够小时为ε^d。在非退化数据分布下，随机采样伪造点的概率极小。扩展至批量SGD和几乎处处光滑损失函数也得到相同的渐近缩放。

Conclusion: 对抗性伪造存在根本性限制，虚假的遗忘声明原则上可以被检测到，这为机器学习遗忘的可验证性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Motivated by privacy regulations and the need to mitigate the effects of
harmful data, machine unlearning seeks to modify trained models so that they
effectively ``forget'' designated data. A key challenge in verifying unlearning
is forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target
point, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing
information. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data
points whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance
$\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a
framework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural
networks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on
the order of $\epsilon$, and when $\epsilon$ is small enough, $\epsilon^d$.
More generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging
set measure decays as $\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and
$r<d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients.
Extensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the
same asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing
that, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly
sampling a forging point is vanishingly small. These results provide evidence
that adversarial forging is fundamentally limited and that false unlearning
claims can, in principle, be detected.

Conclusion: 机器学习基于模型为液态金属冷却微型热池的设计优化提供了高效的代替工具，减少了计算成本和时间

Abstract: A surrogate model is developed to predict the convective heat transfer
coefficient of liquid sodium (Na) flow within rectangular miniature heat sinks.
Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network
are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in
rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised
physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to
increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed
neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the
loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a
better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on
water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the
self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat
transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only
physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine
learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity
modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive.
Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for
the design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.

TL;DR: X-SQL是一个基于开源模型的领先Text-to-SQL框架，通过创新的模式专家组件显著提升了SQL查询生成质量，在Spider数据集上达到了84.9%和82.5%的执行准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管当前基于LLM的Text-to-SQL框架取得了不错的结果，但研究社区往往忽视了数据库模式信息对生成高质量SQL查询的重要性。研究发现模式信息在Text-to-SQL任务中起着重要甚至主导作用。

Method: 提出了包含两个组件的数据库模式专家：1）X-Linking - 基于LLM监督微调的Schema Linking方法；2）X-Admin - 专注于Schema Understanding，弥合抽象模式信息与用户自然语言问题之间的差距。还采用了多LLM策略来进一步提升性能。

Result: 在Spider-Dev数据集上达到84.9%的执行准确率，在Spider-Test数据集上达到82.5%的执行准确率，成为基于开源模型的领先Text-to-SQL框架。

Conclusion: 通过专注于数据库模式信息的深度理解和利用，结合创新的模式专家组件和多LLM策略，X-SQL框架在Text-to-SQL任务中取得了卓越的性能表现，证明了模式信息在此类任务中的关键作用。

Abstract: With Large Language Models' (LLMs) emergent abilities on code generation
tasks, Text-to-SQL has become one of the most popular downstream applications.
Despite the strong results of multiple recent LLM-based Text-to-SQL frameworks,
the research community often overlooks the importance of database schema
information for generating high-quality SQL queries. We find that such schema
information plays a significant or even dominant role in the Text-to-SQL task.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel database schema expert with two
components. We first introduce X-Linking, an LLM Supervised Finetuning
(SFT)-based method that achieves superior Schema Linking results compared to
existing open-source Text-to-SQL methods. In addition, we innovatively propose
an X-Admin component that focuses on Schema Understanding by bridging the gap
between abstract schema information and the user's natural language question.
Aside from better learning with schema information, we experiment with
Multi-LLMs for different components within the system to further boost its
performance. By incorporating these techniques into our end-to-end framework,
X-SQL, we have achieved Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on the Spider-Dev dataset
and 82.5% on the Spider-Test dataset. This outstanding performance establishes
X-SQL as the leading Text-to-SQL framework based on open-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于自然语言的基础模型在处理电信、电商和金融等领域的结构化交互时，通过将事件序列化为文本会破坏语义完整性，丢失关键上下文信息，无法真正理解用户行为。

Method: 采用复合标记化原则，将每个多属性事件视为单个语义连贯单元，使模型能够学习用户行为的底层"语法"，感知完整的交互而非离散的数据流。

Result: 该架构不仅提高了预测准确性，而且代表了向创建更适应性和智能预测系统的根本性进步。

Conclusion: UIFM模型通过创新的复合标记化方法，为构建真正理解复杂事件序列的智能系统提供了基础性解决方案，在行为理解和预测系统方面取得了重要突破。

Abstract: A central goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems that can
understand and predict complex, evolving sequences of events. However, current
foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic
nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications,
e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them
into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we
introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model
engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle
of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a
single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying
"grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a
disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is
not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more
adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

Result: 显著减少对环境交互的依赖，用最少的环境交互实现高性能策略

Conclusion: PolicyEvolve为多玩家游戏提供了一种高效、可解释的程序化策略生成框架，降低了人工编码需求

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress
in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training
effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and
substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack
interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers
have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based
policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.
Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating
programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces
reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies
with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:
Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool
preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool
stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently
high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The
Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top
three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the
current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy
using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited
into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves
a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it
is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction
data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes
directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner

Conclusion: ARIES是首个建立时间序列数据属性与建模策略关系的研究，同时实现了模型推荐系统，为现实世界时间序列提供可解释的建议

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have
been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series
properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an
intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing
benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,
restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there
is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost
expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream
applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing
relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for
recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we
construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a
comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct
an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the
relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our
experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we
propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing
interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the
first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series
data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation
system. The code is available at: https://github.com/blisky-li/ARIES.

Conclusion: 该代模型既准确又高效，为大规模HTS磁铁的快速分析提供了有力工具

Abstract: Finite element method (FEM) is widely used in high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) magnets, but its computational cost increases with magnet
size and becomes time-consuming for meter-scale magnets, especially when
multi-physics couplings are considered, which limits the fast design of
large-scale REBCO magnet systems. In this work, a surrogate model based on a
fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict the
space-time current density distribution in REBCO solenoids. Training datasets
were generated from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes.
The results demonstrate that, for deeper networks, the FCRN architecture
achieves better convergence than conventional fully connected network (FCN),
with the configuration of 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer
providing the most favorable balance between training accuracy and
generalization capability. Extrapolation studies show that the model can
reliably predict magnetization losses for up to 50% beyond the training range,
with maximum errors below 10%. The surrogate model achieves predictions several
orders of magnitude faster than FEM and still remains advantageous when
training costs are included. These results indicate that the proposed
FCRN-based surrogate model provides both accuracy and efficiency, offering a
promising tool for the rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.

Abstract: Time-inconsistent preferences, where agents favor smaller-sooner over
larger-later rewards, are a key feature of human and animal decision-making.
Quasi-Hyperbolic (QH) discounting provides a simple yet powerful model for this
behavior, but its integration into the reinforcement learning (RL) framework
has been limited. This paper addresses key theoretical and algorithmic gaps for
precommitted agents with QH preferences. We make two primary contributions: (i)
we formally characterize the structure of the optimal policy, proving for the
first time that it reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form; and (ii)
we design the first practical, model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation
and Q-learning in this setting, both with provable convergence guarantees. Our
results provide foundational insights for incorporating QH preferences in RL.

Abstract: Beginning with text and images, generative AI has expanded to audio, video,
computer code, and molecules. Yet, if generative AI is the answer, what is the
question? We explore the foundations of generation as a distinct machine
learning task with connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making.
We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models,
variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks,
and diffusion models. We then introduce a probabilistic framework that
emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review
a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study
generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative
models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially
responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and
copyright and IP. We adopt a task-first framing of generation, focusing on what
generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models
implement it.

### [258] [Data-Efficient Time-Dependent PDE Surrogates: Graph Neural Simulators vs Neural Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06154)
*Dibyajyoti Nayak,Somdatta Goswami*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合图神经网络和显式时间步进方法的框架，显著提高了神经算子在数据稀缺情况下的性能，在三个典型PDE系统中仅用3%的训练数据就实现了低于1%的相对L2误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经算子需要大量训练数据且在数据稀缺时表现不佳，许多现有方法没有显式编码物理演化的因果性和时间局部性结构，而自回归模型虽然保持因果性但存在误差累积问题。

Method: 采用图神经网络模拟器(GNS)框架，结合消息传递图神经网络和显式数值时间步进方案，通过建模瞬时时间导数来学习PDE解。引入了PCA+KMeans轨迹选择策略来提升低数据性能。

Result: 在三个PDE系统(2D Burgers标量方程、耦合Burgers向量方程、Allen-Cahn方程)上，GNS仅用30个训练样本(总数据1000的3%)就实现了低于1%的相对L2误差。相比FNO AR和DON AR，分别减少了82.48%和99.86%的自回归误差。

Conclusion: 将基于图的局部归纳偏置与传统时间积分器相结合，可以产生准确、物理一致且可扩展的时变PDE代理模型，显著提高了数据效率和长期预测稳定性。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training
data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time
structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality
by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We
employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network
framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate
forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time
derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D
Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D
Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly
improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with
substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines
like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors
with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all
three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended
temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error
by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a
PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance.
Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional
time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate
models for time-dependent PDEs.

Abstract: The field of human activity recognition has evolved significantly, driven
largely by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) device technology,
particularly in personal devices. This study investigates the use of
ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for tracking inhabitant paths in home
environments using deep learning models. UWB technology estimates user
locations via time-of-flight and time-difference-of-arrival methods, which are
significantly affected by the presence of walls and obstacles in real
environments, reducing their precision. To address these challenges, we propose
a fingerprinting-based approach utilizing received signal strength indicator
(RSSI) data collected from inhabitants in two flats (60 m2 and 100 m2) while
performing daily activities. We compare the performance of convolutional neural
network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid CNN+LSTM models, as
well as the use of Bluetooth technology. Additionally, we evaluate the impact
of the type and duration of the temporal window (future, past, or a combination
of both). Our results demonstrate a mean absolute error close to 50 cm,
highlighting the superiority of the hybrid model in providing accurate location
estimates, thus facilitating its application in daily human activity
recognition in residential settings.

TL;DR: 通过提出一种基于可参数化乘积共享模板的布尔重写技术，在精确度损失小的情况下最大化减少神经网络中算术运算器的面积，从而降低边缘设备的能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘设备上部署神经网络需要在能耗和精确度之间取得平衡，近似计算技术可通过降低算术运算器的精确度来节省能量。需要一种方法在同样的精确度损失下实现更好的面积节省效果。

Method: 改进现有的XPAT布尔重写技术，提出一种新的基于可参数化乘积共享模板的方法。该模板能够作为合成面积的代理指标，通过模板参数来优化电路面积。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法能够更好地收敛到低面积解决方案，且在找到更好的近似解方面超过了原始XPAT和其他两种现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过提出的可参数化乘积共享模板方法，在精确度损失小的前提下，能够有效降低神经网络中算术运算器的面积，从而降低边缘设备的能耗，为边缘计算提供了更好的能效比。

Abstract: Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between
the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting
classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate
computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the
accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to
reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks -
i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we
improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To
achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently
proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite
circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to
produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum
of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters
can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on
parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area.
We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area
solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original
XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>

Motivation: 现有Lung-RADS系统仅基于肺结节特征进行风险分层，缺乏对多种风险因素的综合考虑，在敏感性和特异性之间存在权衡

Method: 构建推理语言模型(RLM)，通过数据集构建与蒸馏、监督微调、强化学习和综合评估，将风险评估任务分解为子组件，分析不同风险因素的贡献，并通过数据驱动的系统方程合成最终风险评分

Result: 在国家肺癌筛查试验数据集上显著改善了风险预测性能，提高了预测准确性和可监控性

Conclusion: 该方法通过思维链推理过程改进预测性能，有助于肺癌筛查的临床转化

Abstract: Accurate risk assessment in lung cancer screening is critical for enabling
early cancer detection and minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures. The Lung
CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been widely used as the
standard framework for patient management and follow-up. Nevertheless,
Lung-RADS faces trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, as it
stratifies risk solely based on lung nodule characteristics without
incorporating various risk factors. Here we propose a reasoning language model
(RLM) to integrate radiology findings with longitudinal medical records for
individualized lung cancer risk assessment. Through a systematic study
including dataset construction and distillation, supervised fine-tuning,
reinforcement learning, and comprehensive evaluation, our model makes
significant improvements in risk prediction performance on datasets in the
national lung screening trial. Notably, RLM can decompose the risk evaluation
task into sub-components, analyze the contributions of diverse risk factors,
and synthesize them into a final risk score computed using our data-driven
system equation. Our approach improves both predictive accuracy and
monitorability through the chain of thought reasoning process, thereby
facilitating clinical translation into lung cancer screening.

explore two state representation strategies, namely Feature-Centric (FC) and
Object-Centric (OC), and employ a Transformer-based Advantage Actor-Critic
(A2C) algorithm for training. The agent has access only to partial observations
and must simultaneously infer the governing rule and learn the optimal policy
through experience. We evaluate our models across multiple rule-based and
trial-list-based experimental setups, analyzing transfer effects and the impact
of representation on learning efficiency.

Abstract: Graph clustering under the framework of differential privacy, which aims to
process graph-structured data while protecting individual privacy, has been
receiving increasing attention. Despite significant achievements in current
research, challenges such as high noise, low efficiency and poor
interpretability continue to severely constrain the development of this field.
In this paper, we construct a differentially private and interpretable graph
clustering approach based on metric embedding initialization. Specifically, we
construct an SDP optimization, extract the key set and provide a
well-initialized clustering configuration using an HST-based initialization
method. Subsequently, we apply an established k-median clustering strategy to
derive the cluster results and offer comparative explanations for the query set
through differences from the cluster centers. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods
in various clustering metrics while strictly ensuring privacy.

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) systems require environment-aware communication, driven
by native artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC). Radio maps (RMs), providing spatially continuous channel information,
are key enablers. However, generating high-fidelity RM ground truth via
electromagnetic (EM) simulations is computationally intensive, motivating
machine learning (ML)-based RM construction. The effectiveness of these
data-driven methods depends on large-scale, high-quality training data. Current
public datasets often focus on single-input single-output (SISO) and limited
information, such as path loss, which is insufficient for advanced multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems requiring detailed channel state information (CSI).
To address this gap, this paper presents UrbanMIMOMap, a novel large-scale
urban MIMO CSI dataset generated using high-precision ray tracing. UrbanMIMOMap
offers comprehensive complex CSI matrices across a dense spatial grid, going
beyond traditional path loss data. This rich CSI is vital for constructing
high-fidelity RMs and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven RM
generation, including deep learning. We demonstrate the dataset's utility
through baseline performance evaluations of representative ML methods for RM
construction. This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research
in high-precision RM generation, MIMO spatial performance, and ML for 6G
environment awareness. The code and data for this work are available at:

Motivation: 解决在大规模商业系统中如何将查询路由到最具成本效益的LLM，同时保持响应质量的基本挑战。

Method: 采用模块化架构，包含轻量级质量估计器、用户控制的容忍度参数路由机制，以及使用冻结编码器和模型特定适配器的可扩展设计。

Result: 在主要云平台上部署后，IPR实现了43.9%的成本降低，同时保持与Claude家族最强模型的质量相当，请求处理延迟低于150ms。

Conclusion: IPR框架有效解决了LLM路由中的性能-成本权衡问题，提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining
response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost
trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, a
quality-constrained Intelligent Prompt Routing framework that dynamically
selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified
tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular
architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts
annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality
prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with
tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over
quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders
with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to
hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level
dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a
comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality
annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR
achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the
strongest model in the Claude family and processes requests with sub-150ms
latency.

Abstract: Personalization is a core capability across consumer technologies, streaming,
shopping, wearables, and voice, yet it remains challenged by sparse
interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. We present
RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a
preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with
lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from
titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative
embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric
contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language
to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings
elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on
all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\%
(Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both
the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late
fusion and LLM-only variants.

Abstract: Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade
safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is
expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact
probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk
assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to
capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders
predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method
reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean
absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features
from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points
by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The
approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream
electronic design automation flows.

Motivation: 现有的层级后训练量化方法采用局部视角，只能实现权重激活感知近似，导致近似不足且与原始输出存在偏差，需要更准确的输出级别一致性方法

Method: 基于对主流LLM结构特征的深入理解，提出LoaQ方法，明确针对输出级别一致性，具有简单闭式解，可与现有技术正交集成

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型家族上的实验表明，LoaQ在仅权重量化和权重激活联合量化中都表现有效，能进一步提升整体量化质量

Conclusion: LoaQ方法更好地符合量化直觉，具有简单实现和强集成能力，有潜力推动后训练量化的前沿发展

Abstract: A natural and intuitive idea in model quantization is to approximate each
component's quantized output to match its original. Layer-wise post-training
quantization (PTQ), though based on this idea, adopts a strictly local view and
can achieve, at best, only activation-aware approximations of weights. As a
result, it often leads to insufficient approximations and practical deviations
from this guiding intuition. Recent work has achieved a more accurate
approximation of linear-layer outputs within the framework of layer-wise PTQ,
but such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full
model output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics
of mainstream LLMs, we propose $LoaQ$, an output-approximation method for
layer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It better
aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution,
making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into
existing quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model
families demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and
weight-activation joint quantization. By integrating seamlessly with existing
quantization strategies, it further enhances overall quantization quality and
shows strong potential to advance the frontier of post-training quantization.

Motivation: 解决现有数据驱动方法无法泛化到其他站点或难以融入能源领域特定数据的问题，为风电预测提供通用的基础模型。

Method: 采用离散化-生成框架：专用时间序列分词器将连续多变量观测转换为离散分层标记，解码器Transformer通过自回归预训练学习风能发电动态的通用表示。

Abstract: High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern
power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a
site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on
fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are
difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper
introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed
specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a
discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first
converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical
tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal
representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on
these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising
approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM
develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between
atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming
specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In
particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data
from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of
its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络常产生冗余的潜在空间，多个坐标编码重叠信息，降低有效容量并阻碍泛化。标准指标如准确率或重建损失只能间接证明这种冗余，无法将其作为故障模式进行隔离。

Method: 引入冗余指数ρ(C)，通过分析从潜在表示导出的耦合矩阵，并通过能量距离将其非对角统计量与正态分布进行比较，直接量化维度间依赖性。

Result: 在MNIST变体、Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上的实验验证表明，低ρ(C)可靠预测高分类准确率或低重建误差，而高冗余与性能崩溃相关。估计器可靠性随潜在维度增加而提高。

Conclusion: ρ(C)提供了一个理论视角和实用工具，用于评估和改进学习表示的效率，可指导神经架构搜索并作为冗余感知的正则化目标。

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在零样本时间序列预测中的涌现能力，特别是如何在不进行微调或自然语言提示的情况下处理偏微分方程解的外推问题。

Method: 使用文本训练的基础模型处理离散化偏微分方程解，分析多步滚动预测中的误差积累，并通过token级输出分布分析ICL进展过程。

Result: 预测精度随时间上下文长度增加而提高，但在更精细的空间离散化下性能下降；多步预测误差随时间范围代数增长；发现ICL三阶段进展模式。

Conclusion: LLMs能够通过上下文学习有效处理PDE解的外推问题，表现出可预测的神经缩放规律，为理解模型内部处理数值数据机制提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent in-context learning
(ICL) capabilities across a range of tasks, including zero-shot time-series
forecasting. We show that text-trained foundation models can accurately
extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized partial differential
equation (PDE) solutions without fine-tuning or natural language prompting.
Predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades at
finer spatial discretizations. In multi-step rollouts, where the model
recursively predicts future spatial states over multiple time steps, errors
grow algebraically with the time horizon, reminiscent of global error
accumulation in classical finite-difference solvers. We interpret these trends
as in-context neural scaling laws, where prediction quality varies predictably
with both context length and output length. To better understand how LLMs are
able to internally process PDE solutions so as to accurately roll them out, we
analyze token-level output distributions and uncover a consistent ICL
progression: beginning with syntactic pattern imitation, transitioning through
an exploratory high-entropy phase, and culminating in confident, numerically
grounded predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何利用机器学习和域特定知识来分析患者生成的健康数据（自由文本餐记录），以支持精准医疗中的个性化营养指导

Method: 使用TFIDF和BERT文本嵌入，统计学习和多层感知器分类器，结合本体论、成分解析器和营养素信息进行域特定信息增强

Result: 机器学习分类器在没有信息增强的情况下已超过自我评估，最佳组合更达到更高准确率，成分解析、食物实体和营养素信息增强效果良好

Conclusion: 机器学习能够利用非结构化自由文本餐记录可靠地分类餐饮是否符合特定营养目标，特别是结合营养域知识时效果更佳，为精准健康提供支持

Abstract: This study examined the use of machine learning and domain specific
enrichment on patient generated health data, in the form of free text meal
logs, to classify meals on alignment with different nutritional goals. We used
a dataset of over 3000 meal records collected by 114 individuals from a
diverse, low income community in a major US city using a mobile app. Registered
dietitians provided expert judgement for meal to goal alignment, used as gold
standard for evaluation. Using text embeddings, including TFIDF and BERT, and
domain specific enrichment information, including ontologies, ingredient
parsers, and macronutrient contents as inputs, we evaluated the performance of
logistic regression and multilayer perceptron classifiers using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score against the gold standard and self assessment.
Even without enrichment, ML outperformed self assessments of individuals who
logged meals, and the best performing combination of ML classifier with
enrichment achieved even higher accuracies. In general, ML classifiers with
enrichment of Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, and Macronutrients information
performed well across multiple nutritional goals, but there was variability in
the impact of enrichment and classification algorithm on accuracy of
classification for different nutritional goals. In conclusion, ML can utilize
unstructured free text meal logs and reliably classify whether meals align with
specific nutritional goals, exceeding self assessments, especially when
incorporating nutrition domain knowledge. Our findings highlight the potential
of ML analysis of patient generated health data to support patient centered
nutrition guidance in precision healthcare.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在数学计算能力方面的鲁棒性，发现虽然LLM在确定性算法执行方面表现良好，但在需要启发式搜索和创造性解决问题的组合难题（如24点游戏）中表现不佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然展现出强大的新兴能力，但其数值推理的鲁棒性仍是一个开放性问题。标准基准测试使用聚合指标评估复杂问题集，但往往掩盖了基础性弱点

Method: 通过评估从基本运算到组合难题的逐步复杂问题来探测LLM的数学计算能力。测试了多个最先进的LLM智能体在包含四个类别的100个问题挑战上：(1)基础算术、(2)高级运算、(3)素数检查、(4)24点数字谜题

Result: 智能体在前三个需要确定性算法执行的类别上取得了高准确率，但在需要在大组合空间进行启发式搜索的数字谜题上持续失败

Conclusion: LLM的熟练度主要局限于回忆和执行已知算法，而非进行生成性解决问题。这表明它们表面的数值推理更像是复杂的模式匹配而非灵活的分析思维，限制了其在需要新颖或创造性数值洞察的任务中的潜力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent
capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open
question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem
sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In
this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on
problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial
puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem
challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced
operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our
results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three
categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they
consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a
heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant
bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents' proficiency is largely
confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing
generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is
more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought,
limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical
insights.

TL;DR: Ban&Pick是一种后训练插件策略，通过识别关键专家和动态剪枝冗余专家，在不重新训练的情况下提升MoE模型性能和推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型的路由器在预训练中过早收敛并强制平衡使用，导致关键专家未充分利用和固定激活专家数带来冗余，限制了模型性能和效率

Method: 提出Ban&Pick后训练策略：Pick组件发现并强化对性能影响大的关键专家；Ban组件根据层和token敏感度动态剪枝冗余专家

Result: 在DeepSeek和Qwen3等细粒度MoE-LLM上，数学、代码和推理基准测试显示准确率显著提升（如Qwen3-30B-A3B在AIME2024从80.67%到84.66%），推理速度提升1.25倍

Conclusion: Ban&Pick无需重新训练或架构改动即可为MoE模型带来免费的性能增益和推理加速，解决了路由优化不足和专家冗余问题

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling
large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs
introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per
token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers
are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely
and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance
and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few
highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced
routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per
token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or
redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training,
plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces
key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to
notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically
pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering
faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained
MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference
acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on
Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from
65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the
vLLM.

manipulated to bypass detection, effectively rendering the protection
ineffective. Our analysis exposes vulnerabilities of on-device AI models and
provides a practical demonstration of how adversaries can exploit them.

<details>

Motivation: 在大数据时代，从高维数据中选择关键变量变得越来越重要。稀疏回归通过促进模型简洁性和可解释性成为有力工具，但现有方法在高度稀疏场景下的表现有待提升。

Method: 改进基于统计物理的变分门控(VG)方法，引入显式特征选择自旋变量，利用变分推断推导可处理的损失函数，并整合现代自动微分技术实现可扩展的高效优化。

Result: VG在高度稀疏场景下表现特别优异，比Ridge和LASSO回归在不同稀疏度水平下提供更一致和稳健的变量选择。发现当引入多余变量时，泛化性能会急剧下降，选择变量的不确定性增加，这一尖锐过渡点可用于估计相关变量的正确数量。

Conclusion: VG在稀疏建模方面具有强大潜力，可广泛应用于压缩感知和机器学习中的模型剪枝等领域，为高维数据变量选择提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Selecting key variables from high-dimensional data is increasingly important
in the era of big data. Sparse regression serves as a powerful tool for this
purpose by promoting model simplicity and explainability. In this work, we
revisit a valuable yet underutilized method, the statistical physics-based
Variational Garrote (VG), which introduces explicit feature selection spin
variables and leverages variational inference to derive a tractable loss
function. We enhance VG by incorporating modern automatic differentiation
techniques, enabling scalable and efficient optimization. We evaluate VG on
both fully controllable synthetic datasets and complex real-world datasets. Our
results demonstrate that VG performs especially well in highly sparse regimes,
offering more consistent and robust variable selection than Ridge and LASSO
regression across varying levels of sparsity. We also uncover a sharp
transition: as superfluous variables are admitted, generalization degrades
abruptly and the uncertainty of the selection variables increases. This
transition point provides a practical signal for estimating the correct number
of relevant variables, an insight we successfully apply to identify key
predictors in real-world data. We expect that VG offers strong potential for
sparse modeling across a wide range of applications, including compressed
sensing and model pruning in machine learning.

Conclusion: MGKD框架能够通过知识蓄结把服务中的关键行为模式转移到服务前风险预测中，显著提升了风险预测的整体性能。

Abstract: Typical financial risk management involves distinct phases for pre-service
risk assessment and in-service default detection, often modeled separately.
This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation
(abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through
the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of
knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical
in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service
data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model
helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service
activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced,
including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the
representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This
approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also
enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from
the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of
pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to
mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on
large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.

Result: JCPGNN-M在性能上匹配eWMMSE，同时在推理速度、大网络泛化能力和不完美信道信息下的鲁棒性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该工作为未来无线网络中约束资源分配提供了一个可扩展且理论上有保证的解决方案。

Abstract: Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless
communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional
deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating
penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically.
However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees
and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios.
Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a
multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE
(eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution
when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and
improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of
supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the
limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled
framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization
method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure
satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of
eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to
larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This
work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained
resource allocation in future wireless networks.

Abstract: On-device deep learning models have extensive real world demands. Deep
learning compilers efficiently compile models into executables for deployment
on edge devices, but these executables may face the threat of reverse

they face challenges in handling compilation optimizations and analyzing

support in decompiling DNN executables. NeuroDeX leverages the semantic
understanding capabilities of LLMs along with dynamic analysis to accurately

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task,
particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal
dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate
the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training
discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer
from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly
knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and
Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too
closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting
classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable
anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a
CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted
manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision
strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly
shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional
network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and
ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated
training data. The code is available at https://github.com/alsike22/CAPMix.

Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational
immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure
methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific
binding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and
prediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention
framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding
site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities,
including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained
language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined
biochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance
adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module
that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance
and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE
module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We
additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to
explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and
generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive
experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB
consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including
Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of
multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes

Abstract: The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast
spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet
unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal
graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short
in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1)
their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical,
event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations
with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To
address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network
(DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis
in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven
dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect
physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware
representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the
research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive
experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming
the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of
up to 0.930.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了从分子结构预测多组分混合物过量吉布斯能的挑战，模型和代码公开可用，并在MLPROP网站上提供交互界面

Abstract: The excess Gibbs energy plays a central role in chemical engineering and
chemistry, providing a basis for modeling the thermodynamic properties of
liquid mixtures. Predicting the excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures
solely from the molecular structures of their components is a long-standing
challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating physical laws
as hard constraints within a flexible neural network. The resulting model,
HANNA, was trained end-to-end on an extensive experimental dataset for binary
mixtures from the Dortmund Data Bank, guaranteeing thermodynamically consistent
predictions. A novel surrogate solver developed in this work enabled the
inclusion of liquid-liquid equilibrium data in the training process.
Furthermore, a geometric projection method was applied to enable robust
extrapolations to multi-component mixtures, without requiring additional
parameters. We demonstrate that HANNA delivers excellent predictions, clearly
outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark methods in accuracy and scope. The
trained model and corresponding code are openly available, and an interactive
interface is provided on our website, MLPROP.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了Wasserstein GAN（WGAN）在非LQG设置下的最优参数选择问题，推导了一维情况下非线性激活函数和非高斯数据的最优参数闭式解，并通过切片Wasserstein框架扩展到高维情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WGAN最优参数研究仅限于线性-二次-高斯（LQG）设置，即线性神经网络和高斯数据。本文旨在突破这一限制，研究非线性激活函数和非高斯数据情况下的最优参数选择问题。

Method: 1）推导一维WGAN在非线性激活函数和非高斯数据下的闭式最优参数；2）采用切片Wasserstein框架扩展到高维情况，将随机投影数据的边缘分布约束替换为原始数据联合分布约束；3）证明线性生成器在切片WGAN中对于非高斯数据可以是渐近最优的。

Result: 1）获得了闭式WGAN参数，在Gaussian和Laplace分布数据下均表现出良好的收敛行为；2）与r-PCA方法相比，所提出的切片WGAN解决方案在达到相同性能的同时需要更少的计算资源。

Conclusion: 本文成功突破了WGAN最优参数研究的LQG限制，为非线性激活函数和非高斯数据情况提供了理论支持和实用解决方案，在计算效率和性能方面均表现出优势。

Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown
distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been
widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer
vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and
only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of
the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on
optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)
setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we
focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG
setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs
when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian.
To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein
framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly
projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original
(unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically
optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our
closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both
Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component
analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve
the same performance while requiring less computational resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QualityFM是一个用于PPG和ECG生理信号质量评估的多模态基础模型，通过大规模预训练和双轨架构实现信号质量理解，在三个临床任务中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ICU和手术室中PPG和ECG信号质量差、不完整和不一致导致误报警和诊断不准确的问题，现有方法泛化性有限且需要大量标注数据

Method: 使用双轨架构处理不同质量的配对生理信号，采用自蒸馏策略，集成窗口稀疏注意力机制的Transformer模型，结合蒸馏损失和重建损失的复合损失函数

Result: 在超过2100万个30秒波形和17.9万小时数据上预训练，开发了三个参数规模不同的模型（9.6M到319M），在心室颤动误报警、房颤识别和动脉血压估计三个临床任务中表现出色

Conclusion: QualityFM提供了一个通用的生理信号质量理解基础模型，具有良好的跨任务迁移能力和临床实用价值

Abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in
intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence
of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms
or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited
generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task
transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel
multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to
acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is
pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second
waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track
architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality,
leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality
signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To
efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local
quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism
within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function,
which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect
reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation
of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models
with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy
and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:
false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial
fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and
ECG signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前车道更换意图预测研究存在一个短板：大多数算法仅在单一数据集上训练和测试，没有考虑模型在不同群体和地域数据上的演示性问题。

Method: 使用LevelX在德国和香港收集的两个数据集，测试车道更换意图预测转换器模型的跨数据集性能。比较单一数据集训练和多数据集同时训练的效果。

Result: 在异构数据集上测试时，模型准确率冲到低点39.43%；而在同时训练两个数据集时，准确率可达到86.71%。

Conclusion: 车道更换意图预测模型的演示性依赖于训练数据的代表性，多数据源训练可以有效提升模型的通用性和稳健性。

Abstract: As a result of the growing importance of lane change intention prediction for
a safe and efficient driving experience in complex driving scenarios,
researchers have in recent years started to train novel machine learning
algorithms on available datasets with promising results. A shortcoming of this
recent research effort, though, is that the vast majority of the proposed
algorithms are trained on a single datasets. In doing so, researchers failed to
test if their algorithm would be as effective if tested on a different dataset
and, by extension, on a different population with respect to the one on which
they were trained. In this article we test a transformer designed for lane
change intention prediction on two datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and
Hong Kong. We found that the transformer's accuracy plummeted when tested on a
population different to the one it was trained on with accuracy values as low
as 39.43%, but that when trained on both populations simultaneously it could
achieve an accuracy as high as 86.71%. - This work has been submitted to the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAGE-2是计算机安全领域的标准测试环境，虽然有许多防御方法，但缺乏严格的正式模型化和有效的最优策略学习方法。

Method: 使用部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程(POMDP)建立CAGE-2正式模型，基于PPO算法并统一粒子筛波技术来减少大状态空间带来的计算复杂度。

Result: 在CAGE-2 CybORG环境中评估，BF-PPO方法在学习到的防御策略质量和所需训练时间方面都显著超过了现有最佳方法CARDIFF。

Conclusion: 通过POMDP正式模型化和高效学习算法，可以在CAGE-2环境中实现更优秀的网络安全防御策略，为计算机安全领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: CAGE-2 is an accepted benchmark for learning and evaluating defender
strategies against cyberattacks. It reflects a scenario where a defender agent
protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods
for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a
formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender
strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy.
Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to
mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the
CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and
compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the
CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the
learned defender strategy and the required training time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用监督变分自编码器对胎心电图信号进行分类和解释，在保持竞争性预测性能的同时部分实现了临床意义特征的编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前深度学习方法在胎心电图信号分析中的可解释性限制，开发能够同时进行信号重建、结果预测和提供解释的模型。

Method: 使用OxMat胎心电图数据集训练监督VAE模型，结合Kullback-Leibler散度和总相关约束来结构潜在空间，评估方法包括AUROC、MSE、决定系数、潜在遍历和无监督分解。

Result: 模型在段落层面获得0.752 AUROC，在整个CTG层面获得0.779 AUROC。基线相关特征被良好编码并与模型分数一致，而短期和长期变异性编码较弱。潜在遍历显示基线特征有明显信号变化。

Conclusion: 监督VAE能在保持竞争性胎儿结果预测的同时部分编码临床意义特征。胎心心率信号的不规则多时尺度性质给生理组件解耦带来挑战，但模型为未来可解释生成模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Objective: To develop and interpret a supervised variational autoencoder
(VAE) model for classifying cardiotocography (CTG) signals based on pregnancy
outcomes, addressing interpretability limits of current deep learning
approaches. Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on
five-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes.
The model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction,
incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC)
constraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared
error (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination,
latent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model
achieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,
where predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both
reconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related
features (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned
with model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were
less strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline
features, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised
decompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates
that supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while
partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular,
multi-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling
physiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as
ECG. Although full interpretability was not achieved, the model supports
clinically useful outcome prediction and provides a basis for future
interpretable, generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决网络入侵检测中监督学习依赖大量标注数据的问题，以及异常检测方法高误报率的局限性，通过自监督学习改进性能。

Method: 提出CLAN方法，将增强样本视为负视图（代表潜在恶意分布），其他良性样本作为正视图，通过对比学习学习判别性潜在表示。

Result: 在Lycos2017数据集上，该方法在二元分类任务中超越了现有自监督和异常检测技术，在有限标注数据微调后实现了优越的多类分类性能。

Conclusion: CLAN方法为网络入侵检测提供了一种有效的自监督学习范式，能够在不依赖大量标注数据的情况下实现高性能检测。

Abstract: Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity.
While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance,
their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many
real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on
benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive
rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques
have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by
learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In
particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the
distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it
between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive
views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In
contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative
pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented
samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious
distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This
approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after
pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and
anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when
fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves
superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing
self-supervised models.

Motivation: 设备端实时数据分布变化挑战轻量级模型的泛化性，当前研究依赖数据密集和计算昂贵的微调方法，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用基于原型的参数编辑框架，云端神经适配器生成参数编辑矩阵，动态聚类原型模型，并通过跨层知识转移实现多层参数一致性调整。

Result: 在多个视觉和推荐任务数据集上的实验证实了Persona的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: Persona提供了一种无需部署后重新训练的高效个性化方法，能够有效应对设备端实时数据分布变化问题。

Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the
generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often
overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive
and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we
introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,
backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model
generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural
adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,
facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer
knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and
generality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管人工智能有望加速科学发现，但其效益分布不均。本文认为主要障碍是社会和制度性的，而非技术性的，旨在揭示这些社会制度障碍并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过分析AI科学领域的现状，识别出四个相互关联的挑战：社区功能障碍、研究优先级与上游需求错位、数据碎片化和基础设施不平等，并探讨其文化组织根源。

Result: 识别出阻碍AI科学发展的核心社会制度障碍，包括叙事偏差、数据贡献低估、激励错位和领域专家与ML研究者之间的隔阂等问题。

Conclusion: 解决AI科学发展障碍需要技术创新的同时，更需有意识的社区建设、跨学科教育、共享基准和可访问基础设施，应将AI科学重新定义为需要可持续合作和公平参与的集体社会项目。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet its
benefits remain unevenly distributed. While technical obstacles such as scarce
data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computation are significant,
we argue that the primary barriers are social and institutional. Narratives
that defer progress to speculative "AI scientists," the undervaluing of data
and infrastructure contributions, misaligned incentives, and gaps between
domain experts and machine learning researchers all constrain impact. We
highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research
priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and
infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and
organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical
innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary
education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for
reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable
collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for
technical progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图具有动态特性，新节点不断添加，现有连接随时间变化。以往基于转导学习的理论研究无法充分建模这种时间演化和结构动态。

Method: 采用PAC-Bayesian理论分析方法，将节点视为依赖且非同分布的数据点，对单层和双层图卷积网络进行理论分析，推导泛化边界。

Result: 推导出了显式包含数据依赖性和非平稳性影响的泛化边界，建立了在节点数量增加时泛化间隙收敛到零的充分条件，发现双层GCN需要更强的图拓扑假设来保证收敛。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解和改进动态图环境中图神经网络的泛化性能奠定了理论基础，揭示了不同层数GCN在动态图中的理论特性差异。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing
graph-structured data across various applications. A critical aspect of
real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually
added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical
studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to
adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this
paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent
and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization
bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data
dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under
which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes
increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal
that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee
convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding
and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.

Result: HAO捕获94%高重要性信息，TBFact可以在不分享敏感数据的情况下进行本地化评估

Conclusion: HAO和TBFact为虫病议会提供了可靠、可扩展的自动化支持平台

Abstract: Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology
specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal
treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary,
typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,
or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records
into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is
often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical
information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent
Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that
coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and
comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient
summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic
variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate
the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these
evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework
designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated
summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board
discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results
show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including
partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict
entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free
evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing
sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation
for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.

Conclusion: 建立了一个解释推理训练引起行为变化的原理性框架，展示了轻量级干预如何匹配全微调性能同时保持可解释性。

Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes language-model
computations remain poorly understood. We study lightweight steering vectors
inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a
reinforcement-learning objective, which can match full fine-tuning performance
while retaining the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using
logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses, we analyze two models
and find: (i) the last-layer steering vector behaves like a token-substitution
bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens
such as "To" and "Step"; and (ii) the penultimate-layer steering vector leaves
attention patterns largely unchanged and instead acts through the MLP and
unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols.
These results establish a principled framework for interpreting the behavioral
changes induced by reasoning training.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in recent
years for identifying malicious samples in a wide range of graph-based
applications, such as social media and e-commerce. However, most GAD methods
assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to
specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such
as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications.
To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the
generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that
leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or
developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple
applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is
still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of
generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD
and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic
taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive
review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we
identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire
future research in this emerging field.

Result: 在CBCP数据集上，BEAM在多个指标上优于最先进方法，证明了其客观评估共情能力的潜力

Conclusion: BEAM为儿童共情能力提供了客观评估工具，并为早期干预儿童亲社会发展提供了初步见解

Abstract: Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional
development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often
only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to
bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG
offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract
static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment
Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM
leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional
dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a
LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a

*Yung-Fu Chen,Sen Lin,Anish Arora*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过深度神经网络学习单个图的路由策略，能够在欧几里得空间中对幻想随机图进行良好的沿用。新提出的GreedyTensile路由策略基于目标距离和节点伸展度，性能超过传统贪心转发。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在欧几里得距离空间中的全对路径距离问题，并实现可扩展、高效的路由策略，以免传统方法的完整图路由计算的高复杂度问题。

Method: 使用深度神经网络，仅需从单个图中采样少量数据。利用网络域知识选择输入特征和设计策略函数，学习近优路由策略。具体包括使用目标距离特征学习Greedy Forwarding，以及使用目标距离+节点伸展度学习GreedyTensile路由。

Result: 学习到的仅使用目标距离特征的DNN准确匹配传统Greedy Forwarding策略。新的GreedyTensile路由策略几乎总是超过贪心转发。该策略可通过低复杂度的线性操作来进行解释，具有超低延迟运行特性。

Conclusion: 通过结合域知识的深度学习方法，可以从单个图表示中学习到可沿用于幻想随机图类的高效路由策略，新提出的GreedyTensile路由策略在性能和可解释性方面都表现优异。

Abstract: We propose a simple algorithm that needs only a few data samples from a
single graph for learning local routing policies that generalize across a rich
class of geometric random graphs in Euclidean metric spaces. We thus solve the
all-pairs near-shortest path problem by training deep neural networks (DNNs)
that let each graph node efficiently and scalably route (i.e., forward) packets
by considering only the node's state and the state of the neighboring nodes.
Our algorithm design exploits network domain knowledge in the selection of
input features and design of the policy function for learning an approximately
optimal policy. Domain knowledge also provides theoretical assurance that the
choice of a ``seed graph'' and its node data sampling suffices for
generalizable learning. Remarkably, one of these DNNs we train -- using
distance-to-destination as the only input feature -- learns a policy that
exactly matches the well-known Greedy Forwarding policy, which forwards packets
to the neighbor with the shortest distance to the destination. We also learn a
new policy, which we call GreedyTensile routing -- using both
distance-to-destination and node stretch as the input features -- that almost
always outperforms greedy forwarding. We demonstrate the explainability and
ultra-low latency run-time operation of Greedy Tensile routing by symbolically
interpreting its DNN in low-complexity terms of two linear actions.

TL;DR: 提出了gcGAIL模型，通过利用乘客群体的共享行为模式来提高个体行为建模效率，在准确性、泛化性和模式演示效率方面优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解和建模个体出行行为响应对于城市交通监管和政策评估至关重要，但马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)在此背景下数据需求量大且面临数据数量、时空覆盖和情境多样性等挑战

Method: 提出了群体效应增强的生成对抗模仿学习(gcGAIL)模型，通过利用乘客群体间的共享行为模式来提高个体行为建模效率

Result: 在公共交通票价折扣案例研究中，gcGAIL在准确性、泛化性和模式演示效率方面优于AIRL、基线GAIL和条件GAIL等最先进基准方法，对空间变化、数据稀疏性和行为多样性具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: gcGAIL模型能够预测任何时间的个体行为响应，为个性化激励提供基础，以诱导可持续的行为改变（更好的激励注入时机）

Abstract: Understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses is crucial
for urban mobility regulation and policy evaluation. The Markov decision
process (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior
modeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is
highly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal
coverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a
group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model
that improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared
behavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using
a public transport fare-discount case study and compare against
state-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results
demonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel
behavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust
to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining
strong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented
passenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at
any time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable
behavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajAware是一个基于强化学习的VANET路由框架，通过动作空间剪枝、图交叉注意力和轨迹感知预测来解决动态拓扑和资源受限问题，在边缘设备上实现高效路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VANET路由面临动态拓扑、不完全观测和边缘设备资源有限的挑战，现有RL方法需要固定图结构且无法适应网络变化，不适合在受限硬件上部署。

Method: 提出TrajAware框架，包含三个组件：(1)动作空间剪枝减少冗余邻居选项；(2)图交叉注意力将剪枝邻居映射到全局图上下文；(3)轨迹感知预测利用历史路由和路口信息估计实时位置。

Result: 在SUMO模拟器中使用真实城市地图进行评估，TrajAware实现了接近最短路径和高投递率，在完整和部分观测场景下均优于最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: TrajAware框架在保持边缘设备效率的同时，有效解决了VANET路由问题，为边缘AI部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent
transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic
topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices.
Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph
structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them
unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an
RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware
integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant
neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse
of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to
the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse
network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical
routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial
observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using
real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that
TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while
maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的小型浅层神经网络Barycentric Neural Network (BNN)，利用重心坐标和固定基点集来精确表示连续分段线性函数，并引入长度加权持久熵(LWPE)作为稳定的拓扑特征，通过优化基点而非权重来实现高效函数逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度或过参数化神经网络计算成本高，需要一种在资源受限环境下（有限基点和训练轮次）能够提供灵活且可解释函数逼近的高效方法。

Method: 提出BNN架构，使用固定基点集和重心坐标定义网络结构和参数；引入长度加权持久熵(LWPE)作为损失函数；直接优化定义BNN的基点而非内部权重。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法相比MSE、RMSE、MAE和log-cosh等经典损失函数，实现了更优越和更快的逼近性能。

Conclusion: BNN结合LWPE损失函数为资源受限环境下的非线性连续函数逼近提供了灵活、几何可解释且高效的方法，通过优化基点实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are
\emph{universal approximators} for continuous functions on compact domains,
many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that
incur high computational costs. In this paper, a new type of \emph{small
shallow} neural network, called the \emph{Barycentric Neural Network} ($\BNN$),
is proposed, which leverages a fixed set of \emph{base points} and their
\emph{barycentric coordinates} to define both its structure and its parameters.
We demonstrate that our $\BNN$ enables the exact representation of
\emph{continuous piecewise linear functions} ($\CPLF$s), ensuring strict
continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact domain
can be approximated arbitrarily well by $\CPLF$s, the $\BNN$ naturally emerges
as a flexible and interpretable tool for \emph{function approximation}. Beyond
the use of this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the
introduction of a new variant of \emph{persistent entropy}, a topological
feature that is stable and scale invariant, called the \emph{length-weighted
persistent entropy} ($\LWPE$), which is weighted by the lifetime of topological
features. Our framework, which combines the $\BNN$ with a loss function based
on our $\LWPE$, aims to provide flexible and geometrically interpretable
approximations of nonlinear continuous functions in resource-constrained
settings, such as those with limited base points for $\BNN$ design and few
training epochs. Instead of optimizing internal weights, our approach directly
\emph{optimizes the base points that define the $\BNN$}. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves \emph{superior and faster approximation
performance} compared to classical loss functions such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and
log-cosh.

Motivation: 为神经模型建立一种基于概率模型的智能代理理论，探索子代理如何聚集成协调的高层实体，以提供代理对齐AI系统的新见解。

Method: 将代理表示为结果分布，以对数得分为认知效用，通过加权对数汇聚定义组合，并使用克隆不变性、连续性和开放性来建立递归结构。

Result: 证明在线性汇聚或二元结果空间中不可能实现严格一致性，但在三种或更多结果空间中可能。形式化了LLM中的"卢伊吉-瓦卢伊吉"现象，发现显现后压制瓦卢伊吉策略比纯粹卢伊吉增强能够更大程度减少一阶对齐偏差。

Conclusion: 建立一种有理论基础的数学框架来理解子代理如何聚集成协调的高层实体，为代理对齐AI系统提供了新的启示和影响。

Abstract: We develop a theory of intelligent agency grounded in probabilistic modeling
for neural models. Agents are represented as outcome distributions with
epistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through
weighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We
prove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary
outcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits
recursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while
tilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an
agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent
persona ("Luigi'") induces an antagonistic counterpart ("Waluigi"), while a
manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order
misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone. These results
clarify how developing a principled mathematical framework for how subagents
can coalesce into coherent higher-level entities provides novel implications
for alignment in agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Simulating realistic financial time series is essential for stress testing,
scenario generation, and decision-making under uncertainty. Despite advances in
deep generative models, there is no consensus metric for their evaluation. We
focus on generative AI for financial time series in decision-making
applications and employ the nested optimal transport distance, a time-causal
variant of optimal transport distance, which is robust to tasks such as
hedging, optimal stopping, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
statistically consistent, naturally parallelizable algorithm for its
computation, achieving substantial speedups over existing approaches.

Conclusion: RT-HCP算法成功解决了模型强化学习在机器人实时控制中的推理延迟问题，实现了高效的在线学习控制。

Abstract: Learning a controller directly on the robot requires extreme sample
efficiency. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample
efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the
robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample
efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we
define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow
inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the
control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare
several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an
algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample
efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with
experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency
FURUTA pendulum platform. Code: github.com/elasriz/RTHCP

Motivation: 现有的基于小波的图神经网络依赖有限阶多项式近似，限制了感受野并阻碍了长程传播，需要一种能同时捕获局部和全局结构的新方法。

Method: 将小波滤波器分解为互补的局部和全局组件：局部聚合使用高效的低阶多项式处理，长程交互通过灵活的谱域参数化捕获，形成统一的混合设计。

Conclusion: LR-GWN通过混合设计在统一的小波框架内整合了短程和长程信息流，有效解决了图机器学习中的长程交互建模挑战。

Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across
distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning.
Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a
principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing
wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial
approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range
propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which
decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local
aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range
interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization.
This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a
principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves
state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range
benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

Conclusion: DRL和DPO技术对于开发鲁棒且与人类价值观对齐的大型视觉语言模型具有重要意义，但仍面临可扩展性、样本效率、持续学习、泛化性和安全性等开放挑战。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or multimodal large language models
represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling
systems to understand and generate content across both visual and textual
modalities. While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress,
fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific
tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for
this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using
reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO
directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an
explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs,
highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human
preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive
multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of
preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as
scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.
The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to
the evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.

TL;DR: 提出异步消息传递框架解决GNN中的过度压缩问题，通过基于节点中心性的批处理更新节点特征，在长距离任务上取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN存在过度压缩问题，特别是在需要长距离交互的任务中。图重布线方法会破坏归纳偏置，而增加通道容量又会增加模型复杂度

Method: 提出模型无关的异步更新框架，基于节点中心性创建节点批次，在每层只更新批次内节点特征，避免同步消息传递中的信息压缩

Result: 在6个标准图数据集和2个长距离数据集上测试，在REDDIT-BINARY和Peptides-struct上分别获得5%和4%的性能提升

Conclusion: 异步消息传递框架能有效缓解GNN的过度压缩问题，提高特征敏感性，在长距离任务中表现优异且不增加模型复杂度

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from Oversquashing, which occurs when
tasks require long-range interactions. The problem arises from the presence of
bottlenecks that limit the propagation of messages among distant nodes.
Recently, graph rewiring methods modify edge connectivity and are expected to
perform well on long-range tasks. Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive
bias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task.
Furthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks
but enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these
shortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that
asynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message
passing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the
node centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches
will only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information
sequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into
fixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed
framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard
synchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets
and two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves
impressive performances with a $5\%$ and $4\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY
and Peptides-struct, respectively.

Motivation: 离线目标条件强化学习在自主导航和运动控制等领域具有重要应用价值，但由于需要从有限覆盖的数据集中学习并泛化到长时程任务，实践中仍面临挑战。

Method: 基于Eikonal偏微分方程推导出物理信息正则化损失，该正则化器与基于时序差分的值学习兼容，可集成到现有离线GCRL算法中。

Result: 与分层隐式Q学习结合后，提出的Pi-HIQL方法在性能和泛化能力方面均有显著提升，特别是在拼接机制和大规模导航任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 物理信息正则化为离线目标条件强化学习提供了有效的几何归纳偏置，能够改善值函数与代价结构的一致性，提升算法性能。

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise
for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting
interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in
practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the
state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on
these challenges, we propose a Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss for value
learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and
which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike
generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our
formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value
functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is
broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be
integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with
Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Physics-informed
HIQL (Pi-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and
generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale
navigation tasks.

Result: 提供了一个可扩展的主动安全路径，能够应对动态环境中的近期漏洞和长期生存风险

Conclusion: 安全应成为动态、对抗性和持续学习的过程，该框架为AGI/ASI发展提供了重要的安全保障方案

Abstract: In this position paper, we address the persistent gap between rapidly growing
AI capabilities and lagging safety progress. Existing paradigms divide into
``Make AI Safe'', which applies post-hoc alignment and guardrails but remains
brittle and reactive, and ``Make Safe AI'', which emphasizes intrinsic safety
but struggles to address unforeseen risks in open-ended environments. We
therefore propose \textit{safe-by-coevolution} as a new formulation of the
``Make Safe AI'' paradigm, inspired by biological immunity, in which safety
becomes a dynamic, adversarial, and ongoing learning process. To operationalize
this vision, we introduce \texttt{R$^2$AI} -- \textit{Resistant and Resilient
AI} -- as a practical framework that unites resistance against known threats
with resilience to unforeseen risks. \texttt{R$^2$AI} integrates \textit{fast
and slow safe models}, adversarial simulation and verification through a
\textit{safety wind tunnel}, and continual feedback loops that guide safety and
capability to coevolve. We argue that this framework offers a scalable and
proactive path to maintain continual safety in dynamic environments, addressing
both near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks as AI advances
toward AGI and ASI.

Conclusion: floq方法展示了迭代计算在值函数学习中的巨大潜力，通过精细控制积分步数实现了比传统单体架构更优越的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: A hallmark of modern large-scale machine learning techniques is the use of
training objectives that provide dense supervision to intermediate
computations, such as teacher forcing the next token in language models or
denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn
complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we
investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD)
methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value
functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq
(flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function
using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching,
typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow
is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced
by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical
integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling
of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately
setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline
RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly
1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures,
highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.

Conclusion: AxelSMOTE通过智能体交互机制有效解决了传统过采样方法的局限性，为类别不平衡问题提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Class imbalance in machine learning poses a significant challenge, as skewed
datasets often hinder performance on minority classes. Traditional oversampling
techniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several
drawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,
limit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To
overcome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based
approach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex
interactions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE
implements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve
correlations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for
meaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic
interpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.
Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms
state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文研究了目标数据投毒攻击中不同测试样本的易受攻击性差异，提出了三个预测标准来评估攻击难度，为实践者提供漏洞评估的见解。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标数据投毒攻击因其易于部署和高成功率构成严重威胁，但现有研究未深入探讨为何某些测试样本更容易受到成功攻击，需要识别影响漏洞的关键特征。

Method: 提出了三个预测标准：遍历预测准确度（通过干净训练动态分析）、毒物距离和毒物预算，用于评估目标数据投毒攻击的难度。

Result: 实验结果表明，这些指标能有效预测现实世界中不同场景下目标投毒攻击的难度变化。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对数据投毒攻击的深入理解，为实践者进行漏洞评估和防御提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose an increasingly serious threat due to
their ease of deployment and high success rates. These attacks aim to
manipulate the prediction for a single test sample in classification models.
Unlike indiscriminate attacks that aim to decrease overall test performance,
targeted attacks present a unique threat to individual test instances. This
threat model raises a fundamental question: what factors make certain test
samples more susceptible to successful poisoning than others? We investigate
how attack difficulty varies across different test instances and identify key
characteristics that influence vulnerability. This paper introduces three
predictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction
accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and
poison budget. Our experimental results demonstrate that these metrics
effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning
attacks across diverse scenarios, offering practitioners valuable insights for
vulnerability assessment and understanding data poisoning attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统在安全关键应用中需要可靠的OOD检测，但现有方法在训练标签噪声环境下性能严重下降，缺乏针对这一问题的系统解决方案。

Method: 整合噪声标签学习中的损失校正技术和信号处理中的低秩稀疏分解方法，构建鲁棒的OOD检测框架。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在严重标签噪声设置下显著优于最先进的OOD检测技术。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决标签噪声环境下的OOD检测问题提供了有效的解决方案，证明了结合不同领域技术的有效性。

Abstract: Robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable component of
modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, especially in safety-critical
applications where models must identify inputs from unfamiliar classes not seen
during training. While OOD detection has been extensively studied in the
machine learning literature--with both post hoc and training-based
approaches--its effectiveness under noisy training labels remains
underexplored. Recent studies suggest that label noise can significantly
degrade OOD performance, yet principled solutions to this issue are lacking. In
this work, we demonstrate that directly combining existing label noise-robust
methods with OOD detection strategies is insufficient to address this critical
challenge. To overcome this, we propose a robust OOD detection framework that
integrates loss correction techniques from the noisy label learning literature
with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art OOD detection
techniques, particularly under severe noisy label settings.

TL;DR: SEELE是一个监督辅助的强化学习框架，通过动态调整问题难度来提升大语言模型的推理能力，相比现有方法在数学推理基准上平均提升3.6个百分点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在探索效率低下的问题，当问题过于困难时模型无法找到可行的推理路径，而问题过于简单时又学不到新能力

Method: 提出SEELE框架，通过为每个训练样本添加自适应长度的提示（部分解决方案），使用多轮采样策略和项目反应理论模型来动态调整提示长度，使问题难度保持在高效学习区间

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，SEELE比GRPO和SFT分别高出11.8和10.5个百分点，比之前最好的监督辅助方法平均高出3.6个百分点

Conclusion: 通过动态调整问题难度使其与模型能力相匹配，SEELE有效提升了强化学习的探索效率，显著改善了语言模型的推理性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable
success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration
inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the
model's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems
are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are
too simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by
quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.
Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR
framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the
high-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint
(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous
hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint
length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the
optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In
each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs
collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next
round. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem
difficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration
efficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5
points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided
approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中子反射率测量是间接测量技术，传统逆向建模方法在处理大量数据或复杂多层结构时效率低下，而现有的机器学习代理模型虽然快速但失去了物理直觉。

Method: 使用自动微分技术对前向反射模型本身进行梯度下降优化，精确计算误差函数相对于感兴趣参数的梯度，从而利用现代优化和推理技术。

Result: 在两个基准案例研究中展示了最先进的性能：厚氧化石英薄膜和高复杂度有机LED多层器件中的鲁棒协同拟合性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为中子反射率数据分析提供了高效且物理直观的优化途径，并提供了开源的可微分反射率核库，便于梯度方法应用于其他数据集。

Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and
interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the
physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density,
roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is
inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g.
lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models
have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines.
Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when
replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a
novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by
performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein,
automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of
the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these
quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful
modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited
in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case
studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz
film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of
organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library
of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so
that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.

Motivation: 探索神经网络如何学习群操作的内在机制，特别是解释grokking现象和网络如何利用有限宽度实现通用化的群操作

Method: 将问题重构为学习特定的3-张量，证明其通常具有低秩特性，通过群的自共轭表示分解和融合结构来获得低秩实现，使用替代模型进行分析

Result: 网络能够找到低秩实现或近似，利用有限宽度以可泛化的方式近似词张量，对于简单乘法词操作，网络实现了类似Strassen的高效矩阵乘法

Conclusion: 研究揭示了神经网络在梯度下降下达到此类解决方案的机制，为理解神经网络学习群操作和grokking现象提供了理论框架

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a simple two-layer neural network with
standard activation functions can learn an arbitrary word operation in any
finite group, provided sufficient width is available and exhibits grokking
while doing so. To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe
the problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is
typically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this
tensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate
representations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out
many components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable
surrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank
implementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to
approximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple
multiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank
implementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient
matrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen. Our work also sheds light on
the mechanism by which a network reaches such a solution under gradient
descent.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI系统在科学、商业和政府领域的广泛应用，理解其失败模式（如幻觉现象）对于建立信任和在关键领域采用AI解决方案至关重要。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器捕获概念表示，在输入空间具有实验控制不确定性的场景下，系统分析预训练transformer模型中幻觉的产生机制。

Result: 研究发现随着输入信息变得非结构化，transformer模型使用的语义概念数量增加；在纯噪声输入下，模型中间激活中识别出多种稳健触发的有意义概念；幻觉输出可以从transformer层激活中的概念模式可靠预测。

Conclusion: 这些关于transformer内部处理机制的见解对AI模型与人类价值观对齐、AI安全、潜在对抗攻击的攻击面以及自动量化模型幻觉风险提供了基础。

Abstract: As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science,
business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an
acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity
of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI
solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when
hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept
representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with
experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic
experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer
model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the
face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes
prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to
hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide
variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate
activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we
confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the
output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept
patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights
on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for
aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for
potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic
quantification of a model's hallucination risk.

Motivation: 现有的基于结果的强化学习方法虽然能显著提高大语言模型的推理准确性，但会系统性降低生成多样性，这在实际部署中严重影响性能。需要找到既能保持准确性又能维持多样性的方法。

Method: 提出基于结果的探索方法，包括两种算法：历史探索（使用UCB式奖励鼓励罕见答案）和批量探索（惩罚批次内重复以促进测试时多样性）。在标准数学竞赛数据集上使用Llama和Qwen模型进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明两种方法都能在提高准确性的同时缓解多样性崩溃问题。理论方面通过新的基于结果的多臂老虎机模型形式化了基于结果探索的益处。

Conclusion: 基于结果的探索方法为强化学习提供了一条实用路径，既能增强推理能力，又不牺牲对可扩展部署至关重要的多样性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,
which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields
substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation
diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is
critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL
post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce
effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our
study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,
where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and
(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a
limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose
outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final
outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,
which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch
exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time
diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models
demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity
collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based
exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these
contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning
without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

Motivation: 全球法规限制了涂鸦艺术家的创作自由，AR技术提供了将涂鸦延伸到数字环境的机会，但现有研究主要关注观众参与而非艺术家的创作过程。

Method: 开发了GestoBrush移动AR原型，通过体感手势进行虚拟涂鸦创作，并进行了共同设计工作坊和六位涂鸦艺术家的评估。

Conclusion: 体感AR工具可以弥合物理涂鸦实践与数字表达之间的差距，为设计尊重街头艺术文化精神并扩展虚拟空间可能性的沉浸式创意系统提供了途径。

Abstract: Graffiti has long documented the socio-cultural landscapes of urban spaces,
yet increasing global regulations have constrained artists' creative freedom,
prompting exploration of digital alternatives. Augmented Reality (AR) offers
opportunities to extend graffiti into digital environments while retaining
spatial and cultural significance, but prior research has largely centered on
audience engagement rather than the embodied creative processes of graffiti
artists. To address this, we developed GestoBrush, a mobile AR prototype that
turns smartphones into virtual spray cans, enabling graffiti creation through
embodied gestures. A co-design workshop underscored the role of
embodiment-physical engagement with surroundings and body-driven creative
processes-in digital workflows. We evaluated GestoBrush with six graffiti
artists and findings suggested that embodied AR interactions supporting artists
bypass real-world constraints and explore new artistic possibilities, whose AR
artworks created enhanced senses of intuitiveness, immersion, and
expressiveness. This work highlight how embodied AR tools can bridge the gap
between physical graffiti practice and digital expression, suggesting pathways
for designing immersive creative systems that respect the cultural ethos of
street art while expanding its possibilities in virtual spaces.

TL;DR: 研究评估了13种视觉语言模型在仅基于视觉刺激识别科学可视化图表核心属性（目的、编码方式、维度）的能力，发现模型在目的和维度识别上表现良好，但在具体编码类型识别上存在困难，且模型规模与性能不成正比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究显示视觉语言模型在可视化解释任务中过度依赖文本线索而非真正的视觉分析，本研究旨在探索更基础的能力——模型是否能像人类一样识别图表的视觉属性。

Method: 使用13种不同的视觉语言模型，基于纯视觉刺激对科学可视化图表进行分类，评估三个标准：目的（如示意图、GUI、可视化）、编码方式（如条形图、点图、节点链接图）和维度（2D、3D），并以人类专家标注的VisType分类作为基准真值。

Result: VLMs在识别图表目的和维度方面通常准确，但在识别具体编码类型方面表现不佳；更大的模型并不总是意味着更好的性能。

Conclusion: 在可视化任务中需要谨慎整合VLMs，并需要人类监督以确保可靠的结果，模型规模不是性能的唯一决定因素。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) hold promise for enhancing visualization tools,
but effective human-AI collaboration hinges on a shared perceptual
understanding of visual content. Prior studies assessed VLM visualization
literacy through interpretive tasks, revealing an over-reliance on textual cues
rather than genuine visual analysis. Our study investigates a more foundational
skill underpinning such literacy: the ability of VLMs to recognize a chart's
core visual properties as humans do. We task 13 diverse VLMs with classifying
scientific visualizations based solely on visual stimuli, according to three
criteria: purpose (e.g., schematic, GUI, visualization), encoding (e.g., bar,
point, node-link), and dimensionality (e.g., 2D, 3D). Using expert labels from
the human-centric VisType typology as ground truth, we find that VLMs often
identify purpose and dimensionality accurately but struggle with specific
encoding types. Our preliminary results show that larger models do not always
equate to superior performance and highlight the need for careful integration
of VLMs in visualization tasks, with human supervision to ensure reliable
outcomes.

Conclusion: 这些工具提高了文档过滤效率和空间注释质量，加快志愿者参与速度，减少手工清理工作，同时增强了公众参与度。

Abstract: Though no longer legally enforceable, racial covenants in twentieth-century
property deeds continue to shape spatial and socioeconomic inequalities.
Understanding this legacy requires identifying racially restrictive language
and geolocating affected properties. The Mapping Prejudice project addresses
this by engaging volunteers on the Zooniverse crowdsourcing platform to
transcribe covenants from scanned deeds and link them to modern parcel maps
using transcribed legal descriptions. While the project has explored
automation, it values crowdsourcing for its social impact and technical
advantages. Historically, Mapping Prejudice relied on lexicon-based searching
and, more recently, fuzzy matching to flag suspected covenants. However, fuzzy
matching has increased false positives, burdening volunteers and raising
scalability concerns. Additionally, while many properties can be mapped
automatically, others still require time-intensive manual geolocation.
  We present a human-centered computing approach with two plug-and-play NLP
pipelines: (1) a context-aware text labeling model that flags racially
restrictive language with high precision and (2) a georeferencing module that
extracts geographic descriptions from deeds and resolves them to real-world
locations. Evaluated on historical deed documents from six counties in
Minnesota and Wisconsin, our system reduces false positives in racial term
detection by 25.96% while maintaining 91.73% recall and achieves 85.58%

*Omar Elgohary,Zhu-Tien*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 研究调查多模态交互（视线控制+手势导航）与传统轨迹板在信息记忆保持方面的效果对比，发现多模态交互虽然信息保持效果相似，但需要更高认知负荷且长期记忆效果更差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态交互技术在产业和学术界广泛发展，但研究人员对其在学习和记忆保持方面的影响上仍未进行充分探索

Method: 对12名参与者进行实验，让他们通过轨迹板和多模态界面（视线跟踪+手势控制）阅读四篇文章，并在立即和24小时后进行信息保持测试，同时使用NASA-TLX认知负荷评估和系统易用性量表

Result: 多模态交互在目标信息保持方面与传统轨迹板使用效果相似，但需要更高的认知负荷，而且长期记忆保持效果有所恶化

Conclusion: 研究结果为多模态系统对认知参与度的影响提供了新知识，并为需要有效记忆表现的未来教育和辅助技术设计提供了建议

Abstract: Each year, multi-modal interaction continues to grow within both industry and
academia. However, researchers have yet to fully explore the impact of
multi-modal systems on learning and memory retention. This research
investigates how combining gaze-based controls with gesture navigation affects
information retention when compared to standard track-pad usage. A total of
twelve participants read four textual articles through two different user
interfaces which included a track-pad and a multi-modal interface that tracked
eye movements and hand gestures for scrolling, zooming, and revealing content.
Participants underwent two assessment sessions that measured their information
retention immediately and after a twenty-four hour period along with the
NASA-TLX workload evaluation and the System Usability Scale assessment. The
initial analysis indicates that multi-modal interaction produces similar
targeted information retention to traditional track-pad usage, but this neutral
effect comes with higher cognitive workload demands and seems to deteriorate
with long-term retention. The research results provide new knowledge about how
multi-modal systems affect cognitive engagement while providing design
recommendations for future educational and assistive technologies that require
effective memory performance.

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DRDCAE-STGNN的新型端到端深度学习框架，用于运动想象脑机接口的特征学习和分类，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 运动想象脑机接口在辅助技术和神经康复方面具有巨大潜力，但由于非平稳性和低信噪比特性，精确高效的解码仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 结合了判别性残差密集卷积自编码器（DRDCAE）和时空图神经网络（STGNN）。DRDCAE通过残差密集连接学习判别性潜在表示，STGNN通过可学习图邻接矩阵捕获动态空间依赖关系，并使用双向LSTM建模时间动态。

Result: 在BCI Competition IV 2a、2b和PhysioNet数据集上分别达到95.42%、97.51%和90.15%的平均准确率，推理时间为每样本0.32毫秒。

Conclusion: 该方法为MI-EEG解码提供了鲁棒、准确且可解释的解决方案，具有良好的跨被试和任务泛化能力，满足实时BCI应用需求。

Abstract: Motor imagery (MI) based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) hold significant
potential for assistive technologies and neurorehabilitation. However, the
precise and efficient decoding of MI remains challenging due to their
non-stationary nature and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper introduces a
novel end-to-end deep learning framework of Discriminative Residual Dense
Convolutional Autoencoder with Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network
(DRDCAE-STGNN) to enhance the MI feature learning and classification.
Specifically, the DRDCAE module leverages residual-dense connections to learn
discriminative latent representations through joint reconstruction and
classifica-tion, while the STGNN module captures dynamic spatial dependencies
via a learnable graph adjacency matrix and models temporal dynamics using
bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). Extensive evaluations on BCI
Competition IV 2a, 2b, and PhysioNet datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance, with average accuracies of 95.42%, 97.51%, and 90.15%,
respectively. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component, and
interpreta-bility analysis reveals neurophysiologically meaningful connectivity
patterns. Moreover, despite its complexity, the model maintains a feasible
parameter count and an inference time of 0.32 ms per sample. These results
indicate that our method offers a robust, accurate, and interpretable solution
for MI-EEG decoding, with strong generalizability across subjects and tasks and
meeting the requirements for potential real-time BCI applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了心率效率(HRE)指标，通过心率与配速的乘积来评估有氧适应能力，为业余跑步运动员提供更稳定和可解释的训练反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 业余跑步者常用心率和配速等单一指标进行训练分析，这些指标存在独立分析、缺乏解释性的问题，不利于长期自我监测。

Method: 开发了Fitplotter客户端网络应用用于健身数据可视化，重新定义心率效率(HRE)指标，并基于一名运动员10年训练数据和12名跑步者的公开数据进行验证。

Result: HRE指标比单独心率或配速提供更稳定和有意义的有氧适应能反馈，与训练量相关，能反映季节性进步，并在训练有素的个体中在长跑过程中保持稳定。

Conclusion: HRE指标可支持每日训练决策，改善健身跟踪用户体验，作为商业平台专有指标的可解释替代方案，对设计用户为中心的健身工具具有意义。

Abstract: Amateur runners are increasingly using wearable devices to track their
training, and often do so through simple metrics such as heart rate and pace.
However, these metrics are typically analyzed in isolation and lack the
explainability needed for long-term self-monitoring. In this paper, we first
present Fitplotter, which is a client-side web application designed for the
visualization and analysis of data associated with fitness and activity
tracking devices. Next, we revisited and formalized Heart Rate Efficiency
(HRE), defined as the product of pace and heart rate, as a practical and
explainable metric to track aerobic fitness in everyday running. Drawing on
more than a decade of training data from one athlete, and supplemented by
publicly available logs from twelve runners, we showed that HRE provides more
stable and meaningful feedback on aerobic development than heart rate or pace
alone. We showed that HRE correlates with training volume, reflects seasonal
progress, and remains stable during long runs in well-trained individuals. We
also discuss how HRE can support everyday training decisions, improve the user
experience in fitness tracking, and serve as an explainable metric to
proprietary ones of commercial platforms. Our findings have implications for
designing user-centered fitness tools that empower amateur athletes to
understand and manage their own performance data.

Motivation: 短形式视频在教育中越来越受欢迎，但大多数是手动创建的，AI自动生成的视频对学习效果、用户体验和信任度的影响尚不清楚

Method: 开发了ReelsEd系统，使用大语言模型从长讲座视频自动生成结构化短视频，保留教师原创内容，并通过62名大学生的用户研究进行评估

Result: ReelsEd在参与度、测验表现和任务效率方面优于传统长视频，且不增加认知负荷，学习者对系统信任度高，认为其清晰、有用且易于导航

Conclusion: 研究结果为将生成式AI集成到教育工具中提供了新的设计机会，强调可用性、学习者自主性和教学一致性

Abstract: Short-form videos are gaining popularity in education due to their concise
and accessible format that enables microlearning. Yet, most of these videos are
manually created. Even for those automatically generated using artificial
intelligence (AI), it is not well understood whether or how they affect
learning outcomes, user experience, and trust. To address this gap, we
developed ReelsEd, which is a web-based system that uses large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate structured short-form video (i.e., reels) from
lecture long-form videos while preserving instructor-authored material. In a
between-subject user study with 62 university students, we evaluated ReelsEd
and demonstrated that it outperformed traditional long-form videos in
engagement, quiz performance, and task efficiency without increasing cognitive
load. Learners expressed high trust in our system and valued its clarity,
usefulness, and ease of navigation. Our findings point to new design
opportunities for integrating generative AI into educational tools that
prioritize usability, learner agency, and pedagogical alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 整合传统编织物与常用基体材料，开发具有不同感官特性的创意材料，并建立量化模型来理解材料体验过程和指导材料选择

Method: 采用7点语义差分量表进行视觩觉评估，通过相关分析、双向方差分析(ANOVA)、探索性因子分析(EFA)和结构方程模型(SEM)来分析数据

Result: 创意材料在印象评价上显著不同于编织物，可通过内在性、美学性和物理性特性来理解，对材料吸引力的标准化回归系数分别为0.486、0.650和0.103

Conclusion: 设计师应利用材料属性之间的关系来提升感官体验，同时考虑技术与体验的平衡，遵循"形式跟随功能"的原则使用材料

Abstract: This study adopts a design-oriented approach to integrate traditional braids
with commonly used matrix materials, developing creative materials with
different sensory properties by altering matrix material types and braid
patterns. Based on these creative materials, a quantitative and structured
model is proposed to assist designers understanding the material experience
process and guide material selection by analyzing the relationship between
material properties and sensory perception. Specifically, participants
evaluated the creative materials under visual-tactile conditions using a
7-point semantic differential (SD) scale. Correlation analysis was performed to
explore the data. The main and interaction effects of matrix materials and
braid patterns on impression evaluation were analyzed using two-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA). A structural equation model (SEM) was constructed based on
exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and path coefficients were computed to
assess the relative importance of material properties in determining material
attractiveness. The results show that, compared to braids, the creative
materials resulted in significant changes in impression evaluation.
Furthermore, the creative materials can be understood through intrinsic,
aesthetic, and physical properties, with their standardized regression
coefficients for material attractiveness of 0.486, 0.650, and 0.103,
respectively. These properties are interrelated and under their combined
influence affect the attractiveness of the material. Therefore, designers
should consider utilizing these relationships to enhance sensory experience in
order to achieve design objectives. Moreover, designers should also consider
balancing technology and experience, using materials according to the principle
of "form follows function".

Conclusion: CAFA展示了多模态AI如何实现智能、以用户为中心的辅助技术，为智能助听设备提供了新范式

Abstract: Traditional hearing aids often rely on static fittings that fail to adapt to
their dynamic acoustic environments. We propose CAFA, a Context-Adaptive
Fitting Advisor that provides personalized, real-time hearing aid adjustments
through a multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) workflow. CAFA combines live
ambient audio, audiograms, and user feedback in a multi-turn conversational
system. Ambient sound is classified into conversation, noise, or quiet with
91.2\% accuracy using a lightweight neural network based on YAMNet embeddings.
This system utilizes a modular LLM workflow, comprising context acquisition,
subproblem classification, strategy provision, and ethical regulation, and is
overseen by an LLM Judge. The workflow translates context and feedback into
precise, safe tuning commands. Evaluation confirms that real-time sound
classification enhances conversational efficiency. CAFA exemplifies how
agentic, multimodal AI can enable intelligent, user-centric assistive
technologies.

Motivation: 心理健康聊天机器人应用存在用户参与度低的问题，影响疗效。受到客户内部对话（如日记、空椅对话）的启发，通过自我来源支持来提高参与度

Method: 设计AI驱动的自我克隆聊天机器人，复制用户的支持策略和交流模式，通过协同实验（N=180）进行验证

Result: 自我克隆聊天机器人在情感和认知参与度方面显著高于普通品识品。自我克隆的可信性是中介因素，需要在保持说服力自我表达和创造积极互动之间取得平衡

Conclusion: 研究为AI基础心理健康干预提供了自我克隆这一有前景的方法，能够有效提高用户参与度，并探索了其在心理健康领域的应用潜力

Abstract: Mental health conversational agents have the potential to deliver valuable
therapeutic impact, but low user engagement remains a critical barrier
hindering their efficacy. Existing therapeutic approaches have leveraged
clients' internal dialogues (e.g., journaling, talking to an empty chair) to
enhance engagement through accountable, self-sourced support. Inspired by
these, we designed novel AI-driven self-clone chatbots that replicate users'
support strategies and conversational patterns to improve therapeutic
engagement through externalized meaningful self-conversation. Validated through
a semi-controlled experiment (N=180), significantly higher emotional and
cognitive engagement was demonstrated with self-clone chatbots than a chatbot
with a generic counselor persona. Our findings highlight self-clone
believability as a mediator and emphasize the balance required in maintaining
convincing self-representation while creating positive interactions. This study
contributes to AI-based mental health interventions by introducing and
evaluating self-clones as a promising approach to increasing user engagement,
while exploring implications for their application in mental health care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI推荐系统在人力资源管理中的透明度问题日益突出，需要研究XAI功能如何影响HR经理的感知和理解，以促进AI在招聘中的负责任采用。

Method: 在线实验，410名德国HR经理比较基线仪表板和三种XAI风格（重要特征、反事实、模型标准）的增强版本，分析主观感知和客观理解。

Result: 实践中的仪表板不解释AI结果且保持不透明。XAI功能改善了中高AI素养用户的主观感知（帮助性和信任度），但未提高客观理解，复杂解释甚至降低准确理解。只有重要特征叠加帮助高素养用户解释。

Conclusion: XAI在招聘中的益处取决于用户的AI素养水平，需要定制化解释策略和针对性素养培训，以确保AI在HRM中的公平、透明和有效采用。

Abstract: AI-based recommender systems increasingly influence recruitment decisions.
Thus, transparency and responsible adoption in Human Resource Management (HRM)
are critical. This study examines how HR managers' AI literacy influences their
subjective perception and objective understanding of explainable AI (XAI)
elements in recruiting recommender dashboards. In an online experiment, 410
German-based HR managers compared baseline dashboards to versions enriched with
three XAI styles: important features, counterfactuals, and model criteria. Our
results show that the dashboards used in practice do not explain AI results and
even keep AI elements opaque. However, while adding XAI features improves
subjective perceptions of helpfulness and trust among users with moderate or
high AI literacy, it does not increase their objective understanding. It may
even reduce accurate understanding, especially with complex explanations. Only
overlays of important features significantly aided the interpretations of
high-literacy users. Our findings highlight that the benefits of XAI in
recruitment depend on users' AI literacy, emphasizing the need for tailored
explanation strategies and targeted literacy training in HRM to ensure fair,
transparent, and effective adoption of AI.

Abstract: Platforms are increasingly adopting industrial models of moderation that
prioritize scalability and consistency, frequently at the expense of
context-sensitive and user-centered values. Building on the multi-level
governance framework that examines the interdependent relationship between
platforms and middle-level communities, we investigate community appeals
systems on Discord as a model for successful community-led governance. We
investigate how Discord servers operationalize appeal systems through a
qualitative interview study with focus groups and individual interviews with 17
community moderators. Our findings reveal a structured appeals process that
balances scalability, fairness, and accountability while upholding
community-centered values of growth and rehabilitation. Communities design
these processes to empower users, ensuring their voices are heard in moderation
decisions and fostering a sense of belonging. This research provides insights
into the practical implementation of community-led governance in a multi-level
governance framework, illustrating how communities can maintain their core
principles while integrating procedural fairness and tool-based design. We
discuss how platforms can gain insights from community-led moderation work to
motivate governance structures that effectively balance and align the interests
of multiple stakeholders.

Meta Quest headsets. Unlike previous methods, Hue4U requires no prior medical
diagnosis and adapts to the user in real time. A user study with 10
participants showed notable improvements in their ability to distinguish
colors. The results demonstrated large effect sizes (Cohen's d > 1.4),
suggesting clinically meaningful gains for individuals with CVD. These findings

Result: 所有参与者都将机器关闭动作示体化：非设计条件下多数解释为死亡，设计条件下多数解释为入睡；设计条件下机器人的可爱性、智力感和生命力感更高

Conclusion: 应该谨慎设计关闭机器人等边缘交互，考虑人们将机器作为社交实体的自动态度

Abstract: It is well established that people perceive robots as social entities, even
when they are not designed for social interaction. We evaluated whether the
social interpretation of robotic gestures should also be considered when
turning off a robot. In the experiment, participants engaged in a brief
preliminary neutral interaction while a robotic arm showed interest in their
actions. At the end of the task, participants were asked to turn off the
robotic arm under two conditions: (1) a Non-designed condition, where all of
the robot's engines were immediately and simultaneously turned off, as robots
typically shut down; (2) a Designed condition, where the robot's engines
gradually folded inward in a motion resembling "falling asleep." Our findings
revealed that all participants anthropomorphized the robot's movement when it
was turned off. In the Non-designed condition, most participants interpreted
the robot's turn-off movement negatively, as if the robot had "died." In the
Designed condition, most participants interpreted it more neutrally, stating
that the robot "went to sleep." The robot's turn-off movement also impacted its
perception, leading to higher likeability, perceived intelligence, and animacy
in the Designed condition. We conclude that the impact of common edge
interactions, such as turning off a robot, should be carefully designed while
considering people's automatic tendency to perceive robots as social entities.

Abstract: Reducing the triangle count in complex 3D models is a basic geometry
preprocessing step in graphics pipelines such as efficient rendering and
interactive editing. However, most existing mesh simplification methods exhibit
a few issues. Firstly, they often lead to self-intersections during decimation,
a major issue for applications such as 3D printing and soft-body simulation.
Second, to perform simplification on a mesh in the wild, one would first need
to perform re-meshing, which often suffers from surface shifts and losses of
sharp features. Finally, existing re-meshing and simplification methods can
take minutes when processing large-scale meshes, limiting their applications in
practice. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel GPU-based mesh
optimization approach containing three key components: (1) a parallel
re-meshing algorithm to turn meshes in the wild into watertight, manifold, and
intersection-free ones, and reduce the prevalence of poorly shaped triangles;
(2) a robust parallel simplification algorithm with intersection-free
guarantees; (3) an optimization-based safe projection algorithm to realign the
simplified mesh with the input, eliminating the surface shift introduced by
re-meshing and recovering the original sharp features. The algorithm
demonstrates remarkable efficiency, simplifying a 2-million-face mesh to 20k
triangles in 3 seconds on RTX4090. We evaluated the approach on the Thingi10K
dataset and showcased its exceptional performance in geometry preservation and
speed.

Abstract: Each element in tensioned structural networks -- such as tensegrity,
architectural fabrics, or medical braces/meshes -- requires a specific tension
level to achieve and maintain the desired shape, stability, and compliance.
These structures are challenging to manufacture, 3D print, or assemble because
flattening the network during fabrication introduces multiplicative
inaccuracies in the network's final tension gradients. This study overcomes
this challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of
such networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the
spinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and
prescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts
the network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex
locations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into
arcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into
printable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D
networks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v)
automatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening
process. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of
viscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an
average element strain error of less than 1.0\%. The method remains effective
for networks with element minimum length and maximum stress of 5.8 mm and 7.3
MPa, respectively. The method is used to demonstrate the fabrication of three
complex cases: a flat spiderweb, a curved mesh, and a tensegrity system. The
programmable tension gradient algorithm can be utilized to produce compact,
integrated cable networks, enabling novel applications such as moment-exerting
structures in medical braces and splints.

Abstract: Hand-drawn character animation is a vibrant field in computer graphics,
presenting challenges in achieving geometric consistency while conveying
expressive motion. Traditional skeletal animation methods maintain geometric
consistency but struggle with complex non-rigid elements like flowing hair and
skirts, leading to unnatural deformation. Conversely, video diffusion models
synthesize realistic dynamics but often create geometric distortions in
stylized drawings due to domain gaps. This work proposes a hybrid animation
system that combines skeletal animation and video diffusion. Initially, coarse
images are generated from characters retargeted with skeletal animations for
geometric guidance. These images are then enhanced in texture and secondary
dynamics using video diffusion priors, framing this enhancement as an
inpainting task. A domain-adapted diffusion model refines user-masked regions
needing improvement, especially for secondary dynamics. To enhance motion
realism further, we introduce a Secondary Dynamics Injection (SDI) strategy in
the denoising process, incorporating features from a pre-trained diffusion
model enriched with human motion priors. Additionally, to tackle unnatural
deformations from low-poly single-mesh character modeling, we present a Hair
Layering Modeling (HLM) technique that uses segmentation maps to separate hair
from the body, allowing for more natural animation of long-haired characters.
Extensive experiments show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: SKEL是一个新的参数化3D人体模型，通过将SMPL模型重新绑定到生物力学准确的骨骼结构上，解决了现有模型在生物力学准确性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体模型（如SMPL）具有简化的运动学结构，与真实人体骨骼系统的关节位置和关节结构不符，限制了其在生物力学领域的应用潜力。需要一种具有生物力学准确骨骼结构且易于摆姿的参数化3D人体模型。

Method: 1）通过优化AMASS序列中SMPL网格内的生物力学准确骨骼来构建数据集；2）学习从SMPL网格顶点到优化关节位置和骨骼旋转的回归器；3）使用新的运动学参数重新参数化SMPL网格

Result: SKEL模型具有比SMPL更生物力学准确的关节位置，骨骼在体表内的拟合效果优于先前方法。能够将现有的人体姿态和形状数据集"升级"为包含生物力学参数。

Conclusion: SKEL提供了一个新工具，实现了"野外生物力学"，同时为视觉和图形研究人员提供了更好约束和更真实的人体关节模型。模型、代码和数据均已开源。

Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from
images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters
of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have
simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint
locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their
potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating
biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion
capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a
parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure
that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL
body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data
of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons
inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL
mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we
re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting
SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and
biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more
biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside
the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes
we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include
biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in
the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better
constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code,
and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成数据增强和token解耦机制，有效提升了新视角合成的重建质量和跨域泛化能力，为可扩展训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in
generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating
novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these
models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene
datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To
overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion
models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic
data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data
generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address
this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer
architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective
learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over
standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.
As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and
cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Project page:

TL;DR: 该论文提出利用认知套利概念，通过游戏论方法设计认知感知防御策略，利用APT攻击者的认知漏洞，通过战略性欺骗机制在防御中获得优势。


<details>

Motivation: 认知漏洞（包括认知能力差异和认知偏见）影响人类决策，可以被具有认知优势的实体利用获得战略优势。论文旨在研究如何利用APT攻击者的认知漏洞来设计有效的防御策略。

Method: 提出双层网络战游戏框架，包含战略级防御欺骗机制设计、操作级行动和战术级TTP执行。采用游戏论推理和跨层级定量建模来分析认知套利策略。

Result: 数值结果显示，虽然防御者初始优势随时间减弱，但战略性部署的欺骗技术能在攻击者规划阶段将负值转为正值，执行阶段总奖励提升至少40%。

Conclusion: 防御者可以通过认知套利策略放大微小初始优势，维持对攻击者的战略优势，实现长期目标如在整个攻击生命周期中保护关键资产。

Abstract: Cognitive vulnerabilities shape human decision-making and arise primarily
from two sources: (1) cognitive capabilities, which include disparities in
knowledge, education, expertise, or access to information, and (2) cognitive
biases, such as rational inattention, confirmation bias, and base rate neglect,
which influence how individuals perceive and process information. Exploiting
these vulnerabilities allows an entity with superior cognitive awareness to
gain a strategic advantage, a concept referred to as cognitive arbitrage. This
paper investigates how to exploit the cognitive vulnerabilities of Advanced
Persistent Threat (APT) attackers and proposes cognition-aware defenses that
leverage windows of superiority to counteract attacks. Specifically, the
proposed bi-level cyber warfare game focuses on "strategic-level" design for
defensive deception mechanisms, which then facilitates "operational-level"
actions and tactical-level execution of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
(TTPs). Game-theoretic reasoning and analysis play a significant role in the
cross-echelon quantitative modeling and design of cognitive arbitrage
strategies. Our numerical results demonstrate that although the defender's
initial advantage diminishes over time, strategically timed and deployed
deception techniques can turn a negative value for the attacker into a positive
one during the planning phase, and achieve at least a 40% improvement in total
rewards during execution. This demonstrates that the defender can amplify even
small initial advantages, sustain a strategic edge over the attacker, and
secure long-term objectives, such as protecting critical assets throughout the
attacker's lifecycle.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Knapsack Contracts问题，将随机背包问题与合约设计结合，研究在代理策略性努力控制随机处理时间情况下的计算复杂性和近似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合随机优化和合约设计中的固有随机性，研究当优化问题中的随机性由策略性努力控制时产生的计算挑战。

Method: 将Knapsack Contracts问题视为带成本和多重选择的随机背包问题，引入投资回报率倒数(IOR)参数来刻画近似保证的扩展程度。

Result: 对于IOR为α的情况，开发了不依赖自适应性的O(α)近似策略算法，并建立了匹配的Ω(α)下界。

Conclusion: IOR是理解Knapsack Contracts问题复杂性和近似性的基本参数，限制IOR对于实现非平凡近似保证既是必要的也是充分的。

Abstract: We formulate the Knapsack Contracts problem -- a strategic version of the
classic Stochastic Knapsack problem, which builds upon the inherent randomness
shared by stochastic optimization and contract design. In this problem, the
principal incentivizes agents to perform jobs with stochastic processing times,
the realization of which depends on the agents' efforts.
  Algorithmically, we show that Knapsack Contracts can be viewed as Stochastic
Knapsack with costs and multi-choice, features that introduce significant new
challenges. We identify a crucial and economically meaningful parameter -- the
Return on Investment (ROI) value. We show that the Inverse of ROI (or IOR for
short) precisely characterizes the extent to which the approximation guarantees
for Stochastic Knapsack extend to its strategic counterpart.
  For IOR of $\alpha$, we develop an algorithm that finds an
$O(\alpha)$-approximation policy that does not rely on adaptivity. We establish
matching $\Omega(\alpha)$ lower bounds, both on the adaptivity gap, and on what
can be achieved without full distributional knowledge of the processing times.
Taken together, our results show that IOR is fundamental to understanding the
complexity and approximability of Knapsack Contracts, and bounding it is both
necessary and sufficient for achieving non-trivial approximation guarantees.
Our results highlight the computational challenges arising when stochasticity
in optimization problems is controlled by strategic effort.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a family of sequential decision-making problems,
collectively called the Keychain Problem, that involve exploring a set of
actions to maximize expected payoff when only a subset of actions are available
in each stage. In an instance of the Keychain Problem, a locksmith faces a
sequence of choices, each of which involves selecting one key from a specified
subset (a keychain) to attempt to open a lock. Given a Bayesian prior on the
effectiveness of keys, the locksmith's goal is to maximize the expected number
of rounds in which the lock is opened -- or equivalently, minimize the
opportunity cost which is the expected number of rounds in which the chain has
a correct key but our selected key is incorrect. We investigate Keychain
Problems under three assumptions on the order in which keychains are tested by
the locksmith: a fixed, known order; a random order sampled from a known
distribution on a set of ``scenarios''; or an order selected by the locksmith
themself. We present an exact algorithm for the simplest of these settings, and
we present approximation algorithms and hardness results for the others. In the
Probabilistic Scenarios setting, our approximation algorithm is based on a
novel connection between combinatorial auctions and policy design for
sequential decision-making problems. To illustrate the generality of this
technique, we apply the same ideas to obtain Philosopher Inequalities for
Online Bipartite Matching and some of its extensions.

Motivation: 解决越南语-英语代码转换场景中现有ASR系统难以捕捉细微音位变化的问题，特别是针对这两种语言在音系特征和相似声音识别方面的模糊性挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段音素中心架构，基于扩展的越南语音素集作为中间表示来进行混合语言建模，支持音素适应和语言转换。

Result: TSPC模型在越南语-英语代码转换ASR任务中 consistently优于现有基线模型(包括PhoWhisper-base)，词错误率降低至20.8%，且训练资源需求更少。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的音素中心两阶段架构有效提升了复杂代码转换场景下的ASR性能，为混合语言语音识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) presents a significant challenge for general Auto-Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle
phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly
difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct
phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition
are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for
Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC
employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme
set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling.
Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing
baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a
significantly lower word error rate of 20.8\% with reduced training resources.
Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme
adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS
Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 传统xi-vector模型仅通过分类损失隐式训练不确定性估计，未考虑帧间时序关系，导致监督效果欠佳。需要更有效的上下文感知不确定性估计方法。

Method: 提出xi+架构：1）加入时间注意力模块，以上下文感知方式捕捉帧级不确定性；2）引入随机方差损失函数，显式监督不确定性学习。

Result: 在VoxCeleb1-O数据集上性能提升约10%，在NIST SRE 2024评估集上提升约11%，表现出一致的性能改进。

Conclusion: xi+架构通过显式的时间注意力机制和随机方差损失，有效提升了说话人识别系统中帧级不确定性估计的准确性，显著改善了系统性能。

Abstract: There are various factors that can influence the performance of speaker
recognition systems, such as emotion, language and other speaker-related or
context-related variations. Since individual speech frames do not contribute
equally to the utterance-level representation, it is essential to estimate the
importance or reliability of each frame. The xi-vector model addresses this by
assigning different weights to frames based on uncertainty estimation. However,
its uncertainty estimation model is implicitly trained through classification
loss alone and does not consider the temporal relationships between frames,
which may lead to suboptimal supervision. In this paper, we propose an improved
architecture, xi+. Compared to xi-vector, xi+ incorporates a temporal attention
module to capture frame-level uncertainty in a context-aware manner. In
addition, we introduce a novel loss function, Stochastic Variance Loss, which
explicitly supervises the learning of uncertainty. Results demonstrate
consistent performance improvements of about 10\% on the VoxCeleb1-O set and
11\% on the NIST SRE 2024 evaluation set.

Abstract: With the development of large-scale diffusion-based and
language-modeling-based generative models, impressive progress has been
achieved in text-to-audio generation. Despite producing high-quality outputs,
existing text-to-audio models mainly aim to generate semantically aligned sound
and fall short on precisely controlling fine-grained acoustic characteristics
of specific sounds. As a result, users that need specific sound content may
find it challenging to generate the desired audio clips. In this paper, we
present DreamAudio for customized text-to-audio generation (CTTA).
Specifically, we introduce a new framework that is designed to enable the model
to identify auditory information from user-provided reference concepts for
audio generation. Given a few reference audio samples containing personalized
audio events, our system can generate new audio samples that include these
specific events. In addition, two types of datasets are developed for training
and testing the customized systems. The experiments show that the proposed
model, DreamAudio, generates audio samples that are highly consistent with the
customized audio features and aligned well with the input text prompts.
Furthermore, DreamAudio offers comparable performance in general text-to-audio
tasks. We also provide a human-involved dataset containing audio events from
real-world CTTA cases as the benchmark for customized generation tasks.

Conclusion: MeanFlow方法有效解决了音频合成中的效率瓶颈，实现了快速高质量的多模态音频合成

Abstract: A key challenge in synthesizing audios from silent videos is the inherent
trade-off between synthesis quality and inference efficiency in existing
methods. For instance, flow matching based models rely on modeling
instantaneous velocity, inherently require an iterative sampling process,
leading to slow inference speeds. To address this efficiency bottleneck, we
introduce a MeanFlow-accelerated model that characterizes flow fields using
average velocity, enabling one-step generation and thereby significantly
accelerating multimodal video-to-audio (VTA) synthesis while preserving audio
quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Furthermore, a
scalar rescaling mechanism is employed to balance conditional and unconditional
predictions when classifier-free guidance (CFG) is applied, effectively
mitigating CFG-induced distortions in one step generation. Since the audio
synthesis network is jointly trained with multimodal conditions, we further
evaluate it on text-to-audio (TTA) synthesis task. Experimental results
demonstrate that incorporating MeanFlow into the network significantly improves
inference speed without compromising perceptual quality on both VTA and TTA
synthesis tasks.

Abstract: Full-duplex voice interaction allows users and agents to speak simultaneously
with controllable barge-in, enabling lifelike assistants and customer service.
Existing solutions are either end-to-end, difficult to design and hard to
control, or modular pipelines governed by turn-taking controllers that ease
upgrades and per-module optimization; however, prior modular frameworks depend
on non-open components and external providers, limiting holistic optimization.
In this work, we present a complete, practical full-duplex voice interaction
system comprising a turn-taking controller, an interaction module, and a
dialogue manager. The controller integrates streaming personalized VAD (pVAD)
to suppress false barge-ins from noise and non-primary speakers, precisely
timestamp primary-speaker segments, and explicitly enable primary-speaker
barge-ins; a semantic end-of-turn detector improves stop decisions. It upgrades
heterogeneous half-duplex pipelines, cascaded, semi-cascaded, and
speech-to-speech, to full duplex. Using internal models, we implement cascaded
and semi-cascaded variants; the semi-cascaded one captures emotional and
paralinguistic cues, yields more coherent responses, lowers latency and error
propagation, and improves robustness. A dialogue manager extends capabilities
via tool invocation and context management. We also propose three system-level
metrics, barge-in, end-of-turn detection accuracy, and end-to-end latency, to
assess naturalness, control accuracy, and efficiency. Experiments show fewer
false interruptions, more accurate semantic ends, and lower latency approaching
industrial systems, enabling robust, natural, real-time full-duplex
interaction. Demos: https://fireredteam.github.io/demos/firered_chat.

integrate a Non-Chord-Tone prediction module, which identifies and excludes

consistency of label signals. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that
AnalysisGNN achieves performance comparable to traditional static-dataset
approaches, while showing increased resilience to domain shifts and annotation
inconsistencies across multiple heterogeneous corpora.

Conclusion: 连续音频语言模型为轻量级高质量音频生成提供了有效解决方案，突破了离散token方法的局限性

Abstract: Audio Language Models (ALM) have emerged as the dominant paradigm for speech
and music generation by representing audio as sequences of discrete tokens.
Yet, unlike text tokens, which are invertible, audio tokens are extracted from
lossy codecs with a limited bitrate. As a consequence, increasing audio quality
requires generating more tokens, which imposes a trade-off between fidelity and
computational cost. We address this issue by studying Continuous Audio Language
Models (CALM). These models instantiate a large Transformer backbone that
produces a contextual embedding at every timestep. This sequential information
then conditions an MLP that generates the next continuous frame of an audio VAE
through consistency modeling. By avoiding lossy compression, CALM achieves
higher quality at lower computational cost than their discrete counterpart.
Experiments on speech and music demonstrate improved efficiency and fidelity
over state-of-the-art discrete audio language models, facilitating lightweight,
high-quality audio generation. Samples are available at

Motivation: 解决MGPHot数据集缺乏音频数据和标准化评测设置的问题，为音乐自动标签任务提供更先进的评测框架

Method: 提供经过精心编辑的YouTube URL集合以获取音频，设计标准化的训练/验证/测试分割，并预计算七种最先进模型的表征

Result: 在MGPHot和标准参考标签数据集上评估了多个模型，显示了专家注释与通用标签注释之间的关键差异

Conclusion: 该研究为音乐理解预程研究提供了更先进的评测框架，帮助识别专业注释与通用标签在自动标签任务中的差异

Abstract: Music autotagging aims to automatically assign descriptive tags, such as
genre, mood, or instrumentation, to audio recordings. Due to its challenges,
diversity of semantic descriptions, and practical value in various
applications, it has become a common downstream task for evaluating the
performance of general-purpose music representations learned from audio data.
We introduce a new benchmarking dataset based on the recently published MGPHot
dataset, which includes expert musicological annotations, allowing for
additional insights and comparisons with results obtained on common generic tag
datasets. While MGPHot annotations have been shown to be useful for
computational musicology, the original dataset neither includes audio nor
provides evaluation setups for its use as a standardized autotagging benchmark.
To address this, we provide a curated set of YouTube URLs with retrievable
audio, and propose a train/val/test split for standardized evaluation, and
precomputed representations for seven state-of-the-art models. Using these
resources, we evaluated these models in MGPHot and standard reference tag
datasets, highlighting key differences between expert and generic tag
annotations. Altogether, our contributions provide a more advanced benchmarking
framework for future research in music understanding.

### [354] [Strategic Concealment of Environment Representations in Competitive Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05503)
*Yue Guan,Dipankar Maity,Panagiotis Tsiotras*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 该论文研究竞争游戏中玩家隐藏地图抽象的策略，通过贝叶斯博弈模型分析攻击者如何通过故意混淆环境抽象来误导防御者，从而获得战略优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究竞争游戏中玩家如何战略性地隐藏地图抽象信息，特别是在防御场景中，攻击者通过混淆自身对环境的抽象来误导防御者的障碍物配置决策。

Method: 采用贝叶斯博弈模型，防御者基于对攻击者抽象信息的信念选择障碍物配置，攻击者选择可能故意混淆其环境抽象的轨迹。提出了一种结合贝叶斯推断、战略规划和信念操纵的双线性规划方法来解决博弈。

Result: 模拟结果表明，通过塑造防御者的信念，攻击者可以诱导防御者做出次优的障碍物配置决策，从而获得战略优势。有目的的抽象隐藏自然地从这种表述中产生，作为提高攻击者性能的手段。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了在竞争游戏中战略性地隐藏抽象信息的重要性，攻击者可以通过故意混淆环境抽象来有效误导防御者，为竞争性环境中的战略决策提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: This paper investigates the strategic concealment of map abstractions used by
the players in competitive games. We consider a defense scenario in which one
player (the Defender) seeks to infer and exploit the abstraction used by the
other player (the Attacker). The interaction between the two players is modeled
as a Bayesian game: the Defender selects a barrier configuration, i.e., a
placement of obstacles that can obstruct the Attacker's movement, based on its
belief about the Attacker's abstraction, while the Attacker chooses a
trajectory that may intentionally obfuscate its own abstraction of the
environment to mislead the Defender. We show that purposeful abstraction
concealment naturally emerges from this formulation as a means of improving the
Attacker's performance. To solve the game, we propose a bilinear programming
approach that integrates Bayesian inference, strategic planning, and belief
manipulation. Simulations demonstrate that, by shaping the Defender's belief,
the Attacker can induce suboptimal Defender barrier placement, thereby gaining
a strategic advantage.

### [355] [Systematic Evaluation of Multi-modal Approaches to Complex Player Profile Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05624)
*Jason Starace,Terence Soule*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过多模态分类技术在36个玩家类别的大规模分析，证明了结合行为数据和语义上下文能够显著提升玩家模型的准确性，但同时也显示了非对话数据在推理理解方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代适配性游戏需要更精细的玩家理解，但传统的5-10个类别的分类方法无法满足需求，行为聚类无法区分行为相似但动机不同的玩家。

Method: 使用19,413个游戏会话数据，比较了仅依靠行为数据的基准方法与结合动作序列和语义描述的多模态方法，采用LSTM处理动作-文本对。

Result: 传统聚类在36个类别下仅达到10%准确率，多模态LSTM提升到21%。非中立玩家模型达到42%准确率（15倍于随机模型），中立玩家降至25%（9倍于随机模型）。

Conclusion: 行为数据单独使用在36个类别下准确率平台在10%左右，多模态整合能够实现25%。设计人员需要通过对话交互来实现人格基于的适配，因为预定义选择无法抓取玩家意图。这为构建更好理解玩家的适配性游戏提供了指导。

Abstract: Modern adaptive games require nuanced player understanding, yet most models
use simplified 5-10 category taxonomies that fail to capture diversity.
Behavioral clustering cannot distinguish players with different motivations who
act similarly. We present a systematic evaluation of multi-modal classification
at scale, combining behavioral telemetry with semantic context to support 36
player profiles. Using 19,413 gameplay sessions from an AI-controlled
text-based RPG, we compared behavioral-only baselines with multi-modal
approaches that integrate action sequences and semantic descriptions.
Traditional clustering achieved only 10% accuracy for 36-category
classification, limited by semantic conflation where opposite actions produced
identical features. Our multi-modal LSTM processing action-text pairs improved
accuracy to 21%, showing both potential and limits of non-conversational data.
Analysis by behavioral complexity revealed that non-neutral profiles reached
42% accuracy (15x above random), while neutral profiles dropped to 25% (9x
above random). Identical actions such as "help the merchant" cannot reveal
whether a player is neutral or strategically waiting. Without access to
reasoning, even multi-modal models struggle, though above-baseline results
confirm a meaningful signal. Since prediction beyond 20 categories remains
unexplored, our findings establish benchmarks for complex player modeling.
Behavioral data alone plateaus near 10% for 36 categories, while multi-modal
integration enables 25%. For designers, this shows that personality-based
adaptation requires conversational interaction, as predefined choices cannot
capture intent. Our evaluation at 36-category scale offers guidance for
building adaptive games that better understand their players.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂的非线性任务对LLM增强的多智能体系统构成挑战，主要由于部分可观测性和次优协调问题，需要新的框架来提升全局任务性能。

Method: 提出Orchestrator框架，采用注意力启发的自涌现协调机制和反射基准测试，通过监控智能体-环境动态和使用主动推理基准来优化系统行为，跟踪智能体间及智能体与环境交互。

Result: 在复杂度递增的迷宫谜题系列上评估，证明该框架在具有长时域目标的动态非线性环境中能有效增强协调和性能。

Conclusion: Orchestrator框架通过创新的协调机制和监控方法，能够缓解部分可观测性影响，使智能体更高效地近似全局任务解决方案。

Abstract: Complex, non-linear tasks challenge LLM-enhanced multi-agent systems (MAS)
due to partial observability and suboptimal coordination. We propose
Orchestrator, a novel MAS framework that leverages attention-inspired
self-emergent coordination and reflective benchmarking to optimize global task
performance. Orchestrator introduces a monitoring mechanism to track
agent-environment dynamics, using active inference benchmarks to optimize
system behavior. By tracking agent-to-agent and agent-to-environment
interaction, Orchestrator mitigates the effects of partial observability and
enables agents to approximate global task solutions more efficiently. We
evaluate the framework on a series of maze puzzles of increasing complexity,
demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing coordination and performance in
dynamic, non-linear environments with long-horizon objectives.

TL;DR: 高密度环境下的多机器人路径规划问题，提出了一种高效的阶段性空位交换算法，解决了传统ILP方法计算成本高的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高密度仓库环境中，传统的整数线性规划方法计算成本过高，无法满足大规模应用的实时性要求

Method: 提出PHANS算法，通过阶段性地交换机器人与空位置的位置，使用贫信算法逐步优化路径规划

Result: 在超过700个格子的大环境中，计算时间从几十到几百秒降低到几秒到几十秒，显著提高了计算效率

Conclusion: PHANS算法为高密度多机器人路径规划提供了一种实用的解决方案，在保持解决质量的同时大幅缩短计算时间，具有广阔的应用前景

Abstract: Multi-agent path finding (MAPF) involves planning efficient paths for
multiple agents to move simultaneously while avoiding collisions. In typical
warehouse environments, agents are often sparsely distributed along aisles.
However, increasing the agent density can improve space efficiency. When the
agent density is high, we must optimize the paths not only for goal-assigned
agents but also for those obstructing them. This study proposes a novel MAPF
framework for high-density environments (MAPF-HD). Several studies have
explored MAPF in similar settings using integer linear programming (ILP).
However, ILP-based methods require substantial computation time to optimize all
agent paths simultaneously. Even in small grid-based environments with fewer
than $100$ cells, these computations can incur tens to hundreds of seconds.
These high computational costs render these methods impractical for large-scale
applications such as automated warehouses and valet parking. To address these
limitations, we introduce the phased null-agent swapping (PHANS) method. PHANS
employs a heuristic approach to incrementally swap positions between agents and
empty vertices. This method solves the MAPF-HD problem within seconds to tens
of seconds, even in large environments containing more than $700$ cells. The
proposed method can potentially improve efficiency in various real-world
applications such as warehouse logistics, traffic management, or crowd control.

Motivation: 弥合分布式系统工程与多智能体系统开发之间的鸿沟，减少对专业智能体知识的依赖，利用熟悉的分布式系统模式和标准来简化MAS开发。

Method: 采用实体-组件-系统架构模式，通过数据导向设计实现多智能体系统，将智能体概念直接集成到分布式系统领域。

Conclusion: HECATE框架成功地将分布式系统工程方法应用于多智能体系统开发，降低了开发门槛并提高了开发效率。

Abstract: This paper introduces HECATE, a novel framework based on the
Entity-Component-System (ECS) architectural pattern that bridges the gap
between distributed systems engineering and MAS development. HECATE is built
using the Entity-Component-System architectural pattern, leveraging
data-oriented design to implement multiagent systems. This approach involves
engineering multiagent systems (MAS) from a distributed systems (DS)
perspective, integrating agent concepts directly into the DS domain. This
approach simplifies MAS development by (i) reducing the need for specialized
agent knowledge and (ii) leveraging familiar DS patterns and standards to
minimize the agent-specific knowledge required for engineering MAS. We present
the framework's architecture, core components, and implementation approach,
demonstrating how it supports different agent models.

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: 研究了三种纳米机器人群算法（KM、KMA、KMAR）在散布式癌症治疗中的敏性药物投送性能，KMAR算法在各种癌症模式下都表现最优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决散布式多个癌症病灶的精确药物投送问题，需要根据病灶需求分配药物负荷，这要求纳米机器人群进行额外协调

Method: 建立纳米机器人行为和胶体环境的数学模型，包括基于实验发现的化学梯度上升/下降移动模型，并提出三种算法：KM（跟随自然化学信号）、KMA（增强信号）、KMAR（增强+抵制信号）

Result: KM算法在化学信号弱时治疗速度过慢；KMA算法提高了治疗速度但终构成功率下降（除集中式癌症模式外）；KMAR算法在所有癌症模式下都表现出艰固性和适应能力

Conclusion: KMAR算法通过结合化学信号增强和抵制机制，能够在各种散布式癌症模式下实现高效、高成功率的精准药物投送，为纳米机器人群治疗提供了最优解决方案

Abstract: Motile nanosized particles, or "nanobots", promise more effective and less
toxic targeted drug delivery because of their unique scale and precision. We
consider the case in which the cancer is "diffuse", dispersed such that there
are multiple distinct cancer sites. We investigate the problem of a swarm of
nanobots locating these sites and treating them by dropping drug payloads at
the sites. To improve the success of the treatment, the drug payloads must be
allocated between sites according to their "demands"; this requires extra
nanobot coordination. We present a mathematical model of the behavior of the
nanobot agents and of their colloidal environment. This includes a movement
model for agents based upon experimental findings from actual nanoparticles in
which bots noisily ascend and descend chemical gradients. We present three
algorithms: The first algorithm, called KM, is the most representative of
reality, with agents simply following naturally existing chemical signals that
surround each cancer site. The second algorithm, KMA, includes an additional
chemical payload which amplifies the existing natural signals. The third
algorithm, KMAR, includes another additional chemical payload which counteracts
the other signals, instead inducing negative chemotaxis in agents such that
they are repelled from sites that are already sufficiently treated. We present
simulation results for all algorithms across different types of cancer
arrangements. For KM, we show that the treatment is generally successful unless
the natural chemical signals are weak, in which case the treatment progresses
too slowly. For KMA, we demonstrate a significant improvement in treatment
speed but a drop in eventual success, except for concentrated cancer patterns.
For KMAR, our results show great performance across all types of cancer
patterns, demonstrating robustness and adaptability.

Main category: cs.NE

TL;DR: 本文评估了混合群体元启发式算法在不同目标空间变换下的鲁棒性和结构不变性，发现基于差分进化的混合算法在各种变形下保持高精度和稳定性，而经典算法在非可分离或扭曲的搜索空间中表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估混合群体元启发式算法在现实世界优化任务中面对各种目标空间变换时的鲁棒性和结构不变性，为实际应用中选择合适的优化算法提供指导。

Method: 将轻量级即插即用混合算子应用于19种最先进算法（包括DE、PSO和生物启发方法），在CEC-2017测试套件上对4种维度（10、30、50、100）进行基准测试，涵盖5种变换类型：基线、平移、缩放、旋转和常数偏移。使用Wilcoxon和Friedman检验、贝叶斯优势分析和收敛轨迹分析进行统计比较。

Result: 基于差分的混合算法（如hIMODE、hSHADE、hDMSSA）在所有测试变形下保持高精度、稳定性和不变性。相比之下，经典算法（特别是PSO和HHO变体）在非可分离或扭曲的搜索空间中表现出显著的性能下降。

Conclusion: 自适应、结构弹性强的混合算法在面临领域特定变换的现实世界优化任务中具有优越性，基于差分的混合方法展现出更好的鲁棒性和不变性特征。

Abstract: This paper evaluates the robustness and structural invariance of hybrid
population-based metaheuristics under various objective space transformations.
A lightweight plug-and-play hybridization operator is applied to nineteen
state-of-the-art algorithms-including differential evolution (DE), particle
swarm optimization (PSO), and recent bio-inspired methods-without modifying
their internal logic. Benchmarking on the CEC-2017 suite across four dimensions
(10, 30, 50, 100) is performed under five transformation types: baseline,
translation, scaling, rotation, and constant shift. Statistical comparisons
based on Wilcoxon and Friedman tests, Bayesian dominance analysis, and
convergence trajectory profiling consistently show that differential-based
hybrids (e.g., hIMODE, hSHADE, hDMSSA) maintain high accuracy, stability, and
invariance under all tested deformations. In contrast, classical
algorithms-especially PSO- and HHO-based variants-exhibit significant
performance degradation under non-separable or distorted landscapes. The
findings confirm the superiority of adaptive, structurally resilient hybrids
for real-world optimization tasks subject to domain-specific transformations.

Motivation: 解决人工智能系统在有限资源平台上实现持续学习时面临的内存和计算需求过高的问题，模仿生物大脑在有限能耗下的持续学习能力

Method: 采用脉冲神经网络架构，整合活动依赖性元可塑性机制缓解灾难性遗忘，使用低精度持续学习参数和定制数据移动策略处理稀疏脉冲，采用内存映射技术将元可塑性参数和突触权重放在同一地址位置

Result: 在任务无关的split-MNIST基准测试中达到74.6%的平均分类准确率，在65nm工艺节点下功耗仅为17.08mW

Conclusion: Genesis架构成功展示了在有限资源平台上实现高效持续学习的可行性，为部署在资源受限环境中的智能代理提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Continual learning, the ability to acquire and transfer knowledge through a
models lifetime, is critical for artificial agents that interact in real-world
environments. Biological brains inherently demonstrate these capabilities while
operating within limited energy and resource budgets. Achieving continual
learning capability in artificial systems considerably increases memory and
computational demands, and even more so when deploying on platforms with
limited resources. In this work, Genesis, a spiking continual learning
accelerator, is proposed to address this gap. The architecture supports
neurally inspired mechanisms, such as activity-dependent metaplasticity, to
alleviate catastrophic forgetting. It integrates low-precision continual
learning parametersand employs a custom data movement strategy to accommodate
the sparsely distributed spikes. Furthermore, the architecture features a
memory mapping technique that places metaplasticity parameters and synaptic
weights in a single address location for faster memory access. Results show
that the mean classification accuracy for Genesis is 74.6% on a task-agnostic
split-MNIST benchmark with power consumption of 17.08mW in a 65nm technology
node.

Conclusion: 这些发现推动了更透明和可靠的群体智能系统的发展，为PSO算法的实际应用提供了理论基础和实用指导。

Abstract: Swarm intelligence algorithms have demonstrated remarkable success in solving
complex optimization problems across diverse domains. However, their widespread
adoption is often hindered by limited transparency in how algorithmic
components influence performance. This work presents a multi-faceted
investigation of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to further understand the
key role of different topologies for better interpretability and
explainability. To achieve this objective, we first develop a comprehensive
landscape characterization framework using Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA)
to quantify problem difficulty and identify critical features affecting the
optimization performance of PSO. Next, we conduct a rigorous empirical study
comparing three fundamental swarm communication architectures -- Ring, Star,
and Von Neumann topologies -- analysing their distinct impacts on
exploration-exploitation balance, convergence behaviour, and solution quality
and eventually develop an explainable benchmarking framework for PSO, to decode
how swarm topologies affects information flow, diversity, and convergence.
Based on this, a novel machine learning approach for automated algorithm
configuration is introduced for training predictive models on extensive Area
over the Convergence Curve (AOCC) data to recommend optimal settings based on
problem characteristics. Through systematic experimentation across twenty four
benchmark functions in multiple dimensions, we establish practical guidelines
for topology selection and parameter configuration. These findings advance the
development of more transparent and reliable swarm intelligence systems. The

Conclusion: 整数在线学习算法为高效训练SNN提供了有效解决方案，可在不牺牲精度的情况下部署到资源受限的神经形态硬件

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising for neuromorphic computing due
to their biological plausibility and energy efficiency. However, training
methods like Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) and Real Time Recurrent
Learning (RTRL) remain computationally intensive. This work introduces an
integer-only, online training algorithm using a mixed-precision approach to
improve efficiency and reduce memory usage by over 60%. The method replaces
floating-point operations with integer arithmetic to enable hardware-friendly
implementation. It generalizes to Convolutional and Recurrent SNNs (CSNNs,
RSNNs), showing versatility across architectures. Evaluations on MNIST and the
Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset demonstrate that mixed-precision models
achieve accuracy comparable to or better than full-precision baselines using
16-bit shadow and 8- or 12-bit inference weights. Despite some limitations in
low-precision and deeper models, performance remains robust. In conclusion, the
proposed integer-only online learning algorithm presents an effective solution
for efficiently training SNNs, enabling deployment on resource-constrained
neuromorphic hardware without sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: Dynamic targeting (DT) is a spacecraft autonomy concept in which sensor data
is acquired and rapidly analyzed and used to drive subsequent observation. We
describe the low Earth orbit application of this approach in which lookahead
imagery is analyzed to detect clouds, thermal anomalies, or land use cases to
drive higher quality near nadir imaging. Use cases for such a capability
include: cloud avoidance, storm hunting, search for planetary boundary layer
events, plume study, and beyond. The DT concept requires a lookahead sensor or
agility to use a primary sensor in such a mode, edge computing to analyze
images rapidly onboard, and a primary followup sensor. Additionally, an
inter-satellite or low latency communications link can be leveraged for cross
platform tasking. We describe implementation in progress to fly DT in early
2025 on the CogniSAT-6 (Ubotica/Open Cosmos) spacecraft that launched in March
2024 on the SpaceX Transporter-10 launch.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We propose a new recursive estimator for linear dynamical systems under
Gaussian process noise and non-Gaussian measurement noise. Specifically, we
develop an approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator using dynamic
programming and tools from convex analysis. Our approach does not rely on
restrictive noise assumptions and employs a Bellman-like update instead of a
Bayesian update. Our proposed estimator is computationally efficient, with only
modest overhead compared to a standard Kalman filter. Simulations demonstrate
that our estimator achieves lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than the
Kalman filter and has comparable performance to state-of-the-art estimators,
while requiring significantly less computational power.

Abstract: This paper introduces a hierarchical framework for population games, where
individuals delegate decision-making to proxies that act within their own
strategic interests. This framework extends classical population games, where
individuals are assumed to make decisions directly, to capture various
real-world scenarios involving multiple decision layers. We establish
equilibrium properties and provide convergence results for the proposed
hierarchical structure. Additionally, based on these results, we develop a
systematic approach to analyze population games with general convex
constraints, without requiring individuals to have full knowledge of the

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel real-time algorithm for controlling wave energy
converters (WECs). We begin with the economic model predictive control (MPC)
problem formulation and apply a novel, first-order optimization algorithm
inspired by recently developed control-based algorithms for constrained
optimization to define the controller dynamics according to the
single-iteration MPC approach. We theoretically analyse the convergence of the
employed algorithm and the computational complexity of the obtained controller.
Results from simulations using a benchmark WEC system indicate that the
proposed approach significantly outperforms standard MPC, thanks to the
inherent ability to handle faster sampling rates.

Conclusion: 该动态规划框架有效解决了随机速度车辆的任务卸载问题，通过两时间尺度方法实现了低复杂度的高性能调度。

Abstract: In this paper, task offloading from vehicles with random velocities is
optimized via a novel dynamic programming framework. Particularly, in a
vehicular network with multiple vehicles and base stations (BSs), computing
tasks of vehicles are offloaded via BSs to an edge server. Due to the random
velocities, the exact locations of vehicles versus time, namely trajectories,
cannot be determined in advance. Hence, instead of deterministic optimization,
the cell association, uplink time, and throughput allocation of multiple
vehicles during a period of task offloading are formulated as a finite-horizon
Markov decision process. In order to derive a low-complexity solution
algorithm, a two-time-scale framework is proposed. The scheduling period is
divided into super slots, each super slot is further divided into a number of
time slots. At the beginning of each super slot, we first obtain a reference
scheduling scheme of cell association, uplink time and throughput allocation
via deterministic optimization, yielding an approximation of the optimal value
function. Within the super slot, the actual scheduling action of each time slot
is determined by making improvement to the approximate value function according
to the system state. Due to the successive improvement framework, a non-trivial
average cost upper bound could be derived. In the simulation, the random
trajectories of vehicles are generated from a high-fidelity traffic simulator.
It is shown that the performance gain of the proposed scheduling framework over
the baselines is significant.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种算法，用于认证电力系统最优潮流(OPF)可行空间中两个运行点之间过渡的不可行性，首次为多种OPF测试用例提供了可行空间不连通的认证。

Motivation: 电力系统运行中，最优潮流问题的可行空间可能由多个不连通的分量组成，评估运行点之间过渡的可行性具有挑战性，因为不同不连通分量中的运行点无法在不违反OPF约束的情况下进行过渡。

Method: 算法首先寻找连接一对可行点的直线上不可行点作为潜在不连通的指示，然后使用凸松弛和边界收紧技术证明该直线法平面上所有点都不可行，从而认证不连通性。

Result: 该算法成功为多种OPF测试用例提供了可行空间不连通的首次认证。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够有效识别和认证OPF可行空间的不连通性，为电力系统运行点过渡可行性评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: By providing the optimal operating point that satisfies both the power flow
equations and engineering limits, the optimal power flow (OPF) problem is
central to the operation of electric power systems. While extensive research
efforts have focused on reliably computing high-quality OPF solutions,
assessing the feasibility of transitioning between operating points remains
challenging since the feasible spaces of OPF problems may consist of multiple
disconnected components. It is not possible to transition between operating
points in different disconnected components without violating OPF constraints.
To identify such situations, this paper introduces an algorithm for certifying
the infeasibility of transitioning between two operating points within an OPF
feasible space. As an indication of potential disconnectedness, the algorithm
first seeks an infeasible point on the line connecting a pair of feasible
points. The algorithm then certifies disconnectedness by using convex
relaxation and bound tightening techniques to show that all points on the plane
that is normal to this line are infeasible. Using this algorithm, we provide
the first certifications of disconnected feasible spaces for a variety of OPF
test cases.

Abstract: We introduce a pursuit game played between a team of a sensor and an attacker
and a mobile target in the unbounded Euclidean plane. The target is faster than
the sensor, but slower than the attacker. The sensor's objective is to keep the
target within a sensing radius so that the attacker can capture the target,
whereas the target seeks to escape by reaching beyond the sensing radius from
the sensor without getting captured by the attacker. We assume that as long as
the target is within the sensing radius from the sensor, the sensor-attacker
team is able to measure the target's instantaneous position and velocity. We
pose and solve this problem as a \emph{game of kind} in which the target uses
an open-loop strategy (passive target). Aside from the novel formulation, our
contributions are four-fold. First, we present optimal strategies for both the
sensor and the attacker, according to their respective objectives.
Specifically, we design a sensor strategy that maximizes the duration for which
the target remains within its sensing range, while the attacker uses
proportional navigation to capture the target. Second, we characterize the
\emph{sensable region} -- the region in the plane in which the target remains
within the sensing radius of the sensor during the game -- and show that
capture is guaranteed {if and only if} the Apollonius circle between the
attacker and the target is fully contained within this region. Third, we
{derive a lower bound} on the target's speed below which capture is guaranteed,
and an upper bound on the target speed above which there exists an escape
strategy for the target, from an arbitrary initial orientation between the
agents. Fourth, for a given initial orientation between the agents, we present
a sharper upper bound on the target speed above which there exists an escape
strategy for the target.

Abstract: Component ageing is a critical concern in power electronic converter systems
(PECSs). It directly impacts the reliability, performance, and operational
lifespan of converters used across diverse applications, including electric
vehicles (EVs), renewable energy systems (RESs) and industrial automation.
Therefore, understanding and monitoring component ageing is crucial for
developing robust converters and achieving long-term system reliability. This
paper proposes a data-driven digital twin (DT) framework for DC-DC buck
converters, integrating deep neural network (DNN) with the spider monkey
optimization (SMO) algorithm to monitor and predict component degradation.
Utilizing a low-power prototype testbed along with empirical and synthetic
datasets, the SMO+DNN approach achieves the global optimum in 95% of trials,
requires 33% fewer iterations, and results in 80% fewer parameter constraint
violations compared to traditional methods. The DNN model achieves $R^2$ scores
above 0.998 for all key degradation parameters and accurately forecasts time to
failure ($t_{failure}$). In addition, SMO-tuned degradation profile improves
the converter's performance by reducing voltage ripple by 20-25% and inductor
current ripple by 15-20%.

Abstract: Boost converters are essential for modern electrification and intelligent
technologies. However, conventional Boost converter models relying on
steady-state assumptions fail to accurately predict transient behaviors during
input voltage and load fluctuations, which cause significant output voltage
overshoots and instability, resulting in failures of electrical systems,
thereby restricting their use in space. This study introduces a first-principle
modeling framework that derives precise dynamic equations for Boost converters
by incorporating non-ideal component coupling. As compared to the most accurate
existing Boost converter model, the proposed models reduce steady-state and
dynamic-state errors between experimental and simulated output voltages by
factors of 11.0 (from 20.9% to 1.9%) and 15.4 (from 77.1% to 5.0%) under input
voltage variations, and by factors of 10.2 (from 15.3% to 1.5%) and 35.1 (from
42.1% to 1.2%) under load changes, respectively. Consequently, a reliable Boost
converter is accordingly designed and on-orbit deployed for precise energy
conversions.

Abstract: The increasing complexity of energy systems due to sector coupling and
decarbonization calls for unified modeling frameworks that capture the physical

paper presents a graph-based modeling approach for multi-energy systems, where
each domain is represented as a layer in a multi-layer graph, and coupling

developed to jointly compute flows and state variables across all carriers. The
proposed model is tested and validated on a realistic case study based on data
from a German distribution network. The results demonstrate convergence,
numerical accuracy, and consistent domain interaction, and demonstrate the
method's applicability for system-wide analysis and its potential as a
foundation for future optimizations in integrated energy systems.

Abstract: We study the robustness of system estimation to parametric perturbations in
system dynamics and initial conditions. We define the problem of
sensitivity-based parametric uncertainty quantification in dynamical system
estimation. The main contribution of this paper is the development of a novel
robustness metric for estimation of parametrized linear dynamical systems with
and without control actions. For the computation of this metric, we delineate
the uncertainty contributions arising from control actions, system dynamics,
and initial conditions. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical findings, we
establish connections between these new results and the existing literature on
the robustness of model reduction. This work provides guidance for selecting
estimation methods based on tolerable levels of parametric uncertainty and
paves the way for new cost functions in data-driven estimation that reward
sensitivity to a desired subset of parameters while penalizing others.

Through systematic profiling of protocol parameters, including

Abstract: This paper considers automatic generation control over an information-sharing
network of communicating generators as a multi-agent system. The optimization
solution is distributed among the agents based on information consensus
algorithms, while addressing the generators' ramp-rate-limits (RRL). This is
typically ignored in the existing linear/nonlinear optimization solutions but
they exist in real-time power generation scenarios. Without addressing the RRL,
the generators cannot follow the assigned rate of generating power by the
optimization algorithm; therefore, the existing solutions may not necessarily
converge to the exact optimal cost or may lose feasibility in practice. The
proposed solution in this work addresses the ramp-rate-limit constraint along
with the box constraint (limits on the generated powers) and the
coupling-constraint (generation-demand balance) at all iteration times of the
algorithm. The latter is referred to as the anytime feasibility and implies
that at every termination point of the algorithm, the balance between the
demand and generated power holds. To improve the convergence rate of the
algorithm we further consider internal signum-based nonlinearity. We also show
that our solution can tolerate communication link removal. This follows from
the uniform-connectivity assumption on the communication network.

Abstract: Modern industrial systems require updated approaches to safety management, as
the tight interplay between cyber-physical, human, and organizational factors
has driven their processes toward increasing complexity. In addition to dealing
with known risks, managing system resilience acquires great value to address
complex behaviors pragmatically. This manuscript starts from the
System-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) as a modelling initiative
for such complexity. The STAMP can be natively integrated with simulation-based
approaches, which however fail to realistically represent human behaviors and
their influence on the system performance. To overcome this limitation, this
paper proposes a Human-Hardware-in-the-Loop (HHIL) modeling and simulation
framework aimed at supporting a more realistic and comprehensive assessments of
systemic resilience. The approach is tested on an experimental oil and gas
plant experiencing cyber-attacks, where two personas of operators (experts and
novices) work. This research provides a mean to quantitatively assess how
variations in operator behavior impact the overall system performance, offering
insights into how resilience should be understood and implemented in complex
socio-technical systems at large.

Conclusion: NGM算法能够有效利用有限通信资源，通过智能查询调度显著提高边缘服务器监控的作业成功率。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a goal-oriented communication problem for edge server
monitoring, where compute jobs arrive intermittently at dispatchers and must be
immediately assigned to distributed edge servers. Due to competing workloads
and the dynamic nature of the edge environment, server availability fluctuates
over time. To maintain accurate estimates of server availability states, each
dispatcher updates its belief using two mechanisms: (i) active queries over
shared communication channels and (ii) feedback from past job executions. We
formulate a query scheduling problem that maximizes the job success rate under
limited communication resources for queries. This problem is modeled as a
Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) with multiple actions and addressed using a
Net-Gain Maximization (NGM) scheduling algorithm, which selects servers to
query based on their expected improvement in execution performance. Simulation
results show that the proposed NGM Policy significantly outperforms baseline
strategies, achieving up to a 30% gain over the Round-Robin Policy and up to a
107% gain over the Never-Query Policy.

Abstract: This paper employs the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) model to describe the dynamics
of opinion evolution within a social network. Under the FJ framework, the
society is divided into two subgroups that include stubborn agents and regular
agents. The opinions of stubborn agents are not influenced by regular agents,
whereas the opinions of regular agents evolve based on the opinions of their
neighboring agents. By defining the origin as the desired collective opinion of
the society, the objective of the paper is to minimize deviations from this
desired opinion. To achieve this, a Stackelberg game is established between the
stubborn and regular subgroups, where the opinion adjustments of the stubborn
agents and the openness variables of regular agents serve as the decision
variables. The proposed solution approach integrates quadratic programming and
dynamic programming to optimize these decision variables at each discrete time
step using forward and backward propagation.

Motivation: 边缘网络需要与细胞通信共享授权谱带，与Wi-Fi共享非授权带，存在严重的共存挑战。传统的规则基或阈值基方法无法有效处理这些复杂情况。

Method: 提出了一种代理智能驱动的双深度Q网络(DDQN)调度框架，能够自主感知队列动态、频道状态和共存状态，并适应性地调整策略以维持服务质量(QoS)。

Result: 模拟结果显示，该框架在授权带宽度有限的条件下，与阈值基调度相比，阻塞率降低了有87.5%。

Conclusion: 这些发现证明了代理智能能够为未来新无线电边缘系统实现稳定、QoS感知和适应性调度的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents an agentic artificial intelligence (AI)-driven double
deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduling framework for licensed and unlicensed band
allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. SL must share licensed
spectrum with cellular communications (CC) and unlicensed bands with Wi-Fi,
posing significant challenges for coexistence. Unlike prior rule-based or
threshold-based methods, the proposed agentic scheduler autonomously perceives
queueing dynamics, channel conditions, and coexistence states, and adapts its
policy to maintain quality-of-service (QoS). Simulation results show that our
framework reduces the blocking rate by up to 87.5% compared to threshold-based
scheduling under limited licensed bandwidth. These findings demonstrate the
potential of Agentic AI to enable stable, QoS-aware, and adaptive scheduling
for future NR SL systems.

*Juan D. Gil,Ehecatl Antonio Del Rio Chanona,José L. Guzmán,Manuel Berenguel*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 采用强化学习统合行为克隆的方法，实现了对开放式光生物反应器pH值的高效控制，在模拟和实验中都显著提升了控制精度和降低了控制成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放式光生物反应器面临环境波动和非线性特性的挑战，需要一种能够处理这些复杂性的自适应控制策略。

Method: 结合强化学习和行为克隆的混合方法：先进行离线训练（从PID控制器学习），然后每日进行在线微调以适应过程动态和抑制快速变化的干扰。

Result: 模拟结果显示：绝对误差积分比PID控制减少8%，比标准RL减少5%；控制芯度明显降低（比PID减少54%，比标准RL减少7%）。8天实验验证了方法在变化环境下的稳健性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了基于强化学习的方法在生物过程控制中具有潜力，为其在其他非线性、易受干扰系统中的广泛应用排埋了基础。

Abstract: The inherent complexity of living cells as production units creates major
challenges for maintaining stable and optimal bioprocess conditions, especially
in open Photobioreactors (PBRs) exposed to fluctuating environments. To address
this, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control approach, combined with
Behavior Cloning (BC), for pH regulation in open PBR systems. This represents,
to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an RL-based control
strategy to such a nonlinear and disturbance-prone bioprocess. Our method
begins with an offline training stage in which the RL agent learns from
trajectories generated by a nominal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
controller, without direct interaction with the real system. This is followed
by a daily online fine-tuning phase, enabling adaptation to evolving process
dynamics and stronger rejection of fast, transient disturbances. This hybrid
offline-online strategy allows deployment of an adaptive control policy capable
of handling the inherent nonlinearities and external perturbations in open
PBRs. Simulation studies highlight the advantages of our method: the Integral
of Absolute Error (IAE) was reduced by 8% compared to PID control and by 5%
relative to standard off-policy RL. Moreover, control effort decreased
substantially-by 54% compared to PID and 7% compared to standard RL-an
important factor for minimizing operational costs. Finally, an 8-day
experimental validation under varying environmental conditions confirmed the
robustness and reliability of the proposed approach. Overall, this work
demonstrates the potential of RL-based methods for bioprocess control and paves
the way for their broader application to other nonlinear, disturbance-prone
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR系统在战术环境中部署增加，但其依赖无缝人机交互的特性使其容易受到认知攻击，这些攻击会操纵用户感知并严重损害决策能力。

Method: 首先模拟人类从MR环境中解释关键信息的过程，然后使用语义有意义的结构表示结果，计算反映感知扭曲程度的量化分数。

Result: 开发了一个能够检测和分析认知攻击影响的稳健可测量方法，通过量化评分系统评估感知扭曲水平。

Conclusion: Perception Graph模型为AR/MR系统提供了一种有效的工具，能够识别和量化认知攻击对用户感知的影响，增强系统的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) systems are increasingly deployed in tactical
environments, but their reliance on seamless human-computer interaction makes
them vulnerable to cognitive attacks that manipulate a user's perception and
severely compromise user decision-making. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Perception Graph, a novel model designed to reason about human
perception within these systems. Our model operates by first mimicking the
human process of interpreting key information from an MR environment and then
representing the outcomes using a semantically meaningful structure. We
demonstrate how the model can compute a quantitative score that reflects the
level of perception distortion, providing a robust and measurable method for
detecting and analyzing the effects of such cognitive attacks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming supply chain management, yet
progress in predictive tasks -- such as delivery delay prediction -- remains
constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, openly available datasets.
Existing datasets are often proprietary, small, or inconsistently maintained,
hindering reproducibility and benchmarking. We present SynDelay, a synthetic
dataset designed for delivery delay prediction. Generated using an advanced
generative model trained on real-world data, SynDelay preserves realistic
delivery patterns while ensuring privacy. Although not entirely free of noise
or inconsistencies, it provides a challenging and practical testbed for
advancing predictive modelling. To support adoption, we provide baseline
results and evaluation metrics as initial benchmarks, serving as reference
points rather than state-of-the-art claims. SynDelay is publicly available
through the Supply Chain Data Hub, an open initiative promoting dataset sharing
and benchmarking in supply chain AI. We encourage the community to contribute
datasets, models, and evaluation practices to advance research in this area.

Abstract: Automatic emotion recognition has become increasingly important with the rise
of AI, especially in fields like healthcare, education, and automotive systems.
However, there is a lack of multimodal datasets, particularly involving body
motion and physiological signals, which limits progress in the field. To
address this, the MVRS dataset is introduced, featuring synchronized recordings
from 13 participants aged 12 to 60 exposed to VR based emotional stimuli
(relaxation, fear, stress, sadness, joy). Data were collected using eye
tracking (via webcam in a VR headset), body motion (Kinect v2), and EMG and GSR
signals (Arduino UNO), all timestamp aligned. Participants followed a unified
protocol with consent and questionnaires. Features from each modality were
extracted, fused using early and late fusion techniques, and evaluated with
classifiers to confirm the datasets quality and emotion separability, making
MVRS a valuable contribution to multimodal affective computing.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实验比较GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3和GLM-4.5在个性化教育辅导任务中的表现，发现GPT-4o在准确性、清晰度和可操作性方面更优，为LLM在个性化学习中的应用提供了实证基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型(LLMs)被趋势性地视为个性化学习的智能助手，但在真实学习场景下的系统性头对头评估仍有限。本研究旨在填补这一空白，通过实验比较不同LLM在辅导任务中的表现。

Method: 研究使用包含学生答案和正确标签的数据集，要求三个先进LLM（GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3、GLM-4.5）进行知识组件分析、学生技能推断和有针对性指导生成。采用Gemini作为虚拟判官进行双向比较评估，包括准确性、清晰度、可操作性和适宜性等维度，并通过Bradley-Terry模型分析结果。

Result: 分析结果显示GPT-4o通常被更偏好，能够产生更信息丰富、结构更好的反馈，而DeepSeek-V3和GLM-4.5虽然有时显示出一些优势，但一致性较低。

Conclusion: 研究结果证明了LLM作为高级教学助手提供个性化支持的可行性，为未来LLM驱动的个性化学习实证研究提供了方法论指导。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent
assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations
within authentic learning scenarios remain limited. This study conducts an
empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task that
simulates a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset comprising a student's
answers to ten questions of mixed formats with correctness labels, each LLM is
required to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components,
(ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance
for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, we employ Gemini
as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons along various dimensions:
accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the
Bradley-Terry model indicate that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing
feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts,
while DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower
consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as
advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide
methodological guidance for future empirical research on LLM-driven
personalized learning.

Abstract: We introduce SasAgent, a multi-agent AI system powered by large language
models (LLMs) that automates small-angle scattering (SAS) data analysis by
leveraging tools from the SasView software and enables user interaction via
text input. SasAgent features a coordinator agent that interprets user prompts
and delegates tasks to three specialized agents for scattering length density
(SLD) calculation, synthetic data generation, and experimental data fitting.
These agents utilize LLM-friendly tools to execute tasks efficiently. These
tools, including the model data tool, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
documentation tool, bump fitting tool, and SLD calculator tool, are derived
from the SasView Python library. A user-friendly Gradio-based interface
enhances user accessibility. Through diverse examples, we demonstrate
SasAgent's ability to interpret complex prompts, calculate SLDs, generate
accurate scattering data, and fit experimental datasets with high precision.

TL;DR: 本文通过自相关分析揭示了提示工程优化地形的结构特征，发现系统化生成和多样化生成会产生根本不同的地形拓扑结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然提示工程已成为优化大语言模型性能的关键技术，但其优化地形的基础理解仍很偏欠。当前方法将提示优化视为黑盒问题，缺乏对其地形拓扑结构的特征化分析。

Method: 使用自相关分析方法在语义嵌入空间中分析提示工程适应度地形结构。通过在错误检测任务上进行实验，采用两种不同的提示生成策略：系统枚举（1,024个提示）和新颖驱动的多样化（1,000个提示）。

Result: 系统提示生成产生平滑衰减的自相关，而多样化生成显示出非单调模式，在中间语义距离处出现相关峰值，表明地形曲折、具有层次结构。在10个错误检测类别中发现不同错误类型存在不同程度的地形曲折性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解提示工程优化地形的复杂性提供了实证基础，揭示了不同提示生成策略导致的根本不同地形拓扑结构。

Abstract: While prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for optimizing
large language model performance, the underlying optimization landscape remains
poorly understood. Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box
problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the
landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness
landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis
across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks
with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024
prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal
fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation
yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits
non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic
distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes.
Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying
degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an
empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt
engineering landscapes.

Motivation: 解决医疗编码中将非结构化临床笔记映射到诊断和手术代码的挑战，提供支持全部ICD-10系统的解决方案

Method: 实施了官方编码指南，构建了一种代理框架，利用大语言模型模仿人类专家的编码方式

Result: 在稀有诊断编码上达到了目前最佳性能，但在高频编码上优化过的判别分类器仍有优势，同时识别了系统性低编码的"盲点"

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗编码领域提供了一种有效的解决方案，特别是在稀有代码处理方面，为未来工作指明了改进方向

Abstract: In medical coding, experts map unstructured clinical notes to alphanumeric
codes for diagnoses and procedures. We introduce Code Like Humans: a new
agentic framework for medical coding with large language models. It implements
official coding guidelines for human experts, and it is the first solution that
can support the full ICD-10 coding system (+70K labels). It achieves the best
performance to date on rare diagnosis codes (fine-tuned discriminative
classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes, to which they are
limited). Towards future work, we also contribute an analysis of system
performance and identify its `blind spots' (codes that are systematically
undercoded).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人类偏好对齐方法（如RLHF、DPO等）虽然有效，但存在奖励破解、奉承、标注者漂移和错误泛化等重复性失败模式，需要统一的理论框架来理解这些系统性缺陷。

Method: 采用KL倾斜形式化分析，构建AI对齐的墨菲定律目录，提出对齐三难困境框架，并通过小规模实证研究进行验证，最后提出MAPS（错误设定、标注、压力、偏移）实践设计框架。

Result: 研究揭示了优化压力倾向于放大代理奖励与真实人类意图之间的差异，系统性地识别了对齐过程中的常见失败模式，并提供了结构化的分析框架。

Conclusion: 本文贡献不是提供不可能定理，而是重新构建对齐辩论围绕结构限制和权衡，为未来设计提供更清晰的指导，强调需要接受对齐过程中的固有权衡。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While
effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward
hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the
concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring
failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we
illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy
rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of
Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to
frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and
generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support.
Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure,
Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive
impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around
structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.

Motivation: 现有的街道设计渲染方案需要大量人工劳动，阻碍了集体奖议和协作决策，而AI辅助生成设计虽有潜力但需要大量领域特定数据且难以实现精确的空间变化设计。

Method: 开发了一个多段系统，集成了车道定位、提示优化、设计生成和自动评估等模块，直接在真实街道图像上编辑和重新设计自行车设施。

Result: 在多样化城市场景中的实验表明，该系统能够适应不同的路网几何形状和环境条件，一贯地产生视觉一致且符合指令要求的结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为应用多段管道到交通基础设施规划和设施设计领域奠定了基础。

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

### [394] [TreeGPT: A Novel Hybrid Architecture for Abstract Syntax Tree Processing with Global Parent-Child Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05550)
*Zixi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TreeGPT是一种新颖的神经架构，结合transformer注意力机制和全局父子聚合来处理AST，在程序合成任务中取得了96%的准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么依赖序列处理，要么使用图神经网络，无法有效捕捉抽象语法树的层次结构和全局依赖关系，需要一种能够同时处理局部依赖和层次结构的混合设计。

Method: 采用混合设计：使用self-attention捕捉局部依赖，专门的Tree Feed-Forward Network通过迭代消息传递建模层次树结构。核心创新是全局父子聚合机制，使每个节点能够逐步聚合整个树结构的信息。

Result: 在ARC Prize 2025数据集上达到96%准确率，显著优于transformer基线(1.3%)、Grok-4(15.9%)和SOAR(52%)，仅使用150万参数。消融研究表明边缘投影是最关键组件。

Conclusion: TreeGPT通过结合注意力机制和层次结构建模，在程序合成任务中表现出色，证明了混合架构在处理复杂树结构数据方面的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines
transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for
processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or
graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both
self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree
Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures
through iterative message passing.
  The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism,
formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in
E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the
hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges
involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This
formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the
entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.
  Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation
with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and
bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down
dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging
visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\%
accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%),
large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis
methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component,
with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal
performance.

Abstract: LLM-based agents have shown promise in various cooperative and strategic
reasoning tasks, but their effectiveness in competitive multi-agent
environments remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
PillagerBench, a novel framework for evaluating multi-agent systems in
real-time competitive team-vs-team scenarios in Minecraft. It provides an
extensible API, multi-round testing, and rule-based built-in opponents for
fair, reproducible comparisons. We also propose TactiCrafter, an LLM-based
multi-agent system that facilitates teamwork through human-readable tactics,
learns causal dependencies, and adapts to opponent strategies. Our evaluation
demonstrates that TactiCrafter outperforms baseline approaches and showcases
adaptive learning through self-play. Additionally, we analyze its learning
process and strategic evolution over multiple game episodes. To encourage
further research, we have open-sourced PillagerBench, fostering advancements in
multi-agent AI for competitive environments.

### [396] [OccVLA: Vision-Language-Action Model with Implicit 3D Occupancy Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05578)
*Ruixun Liu,Lingyu Kong,Derun Li,Hang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OccVLA是一个创新的多模态框架，将3D占用表示集成到统一推理过程中，无需显式3D输入即可实现强大的3D空间理解，在自动驾驶任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM模型缺乏稳健的3D空间理解能力，这主要源于两个挑战：难以构建有效的3D表示而无需昂贵人工标注，以及由于缺乏大规模3D视觉语言预训练导致空间细节丢失。

Method: 提出OccVLA框架，将密集3D占用既作为预测输出又作为监督信号，使模型能够直接从2D视觉输入学习细粒度空间结构。占用预测被视为隐式推理过程，在推理时可跳过而不影响性能。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中实现了轨迹规划的最先进结果，在3D视觉问答任务上表现出优异性能。

Conclusion: OccVLA提供了一个可扩展、可解释且完全基于视觉的自动驾驶解决方案，无需额外计算开销即可实现强大的3D空间理解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance
degradation, thereby adding no extra computational overhead. OccVLA achieves
state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes benchmark for trajectory planning and
demonstrates superior performance on 3D visual question-answering tasks,
offering a scalable, interpretable, and fully vision-based solution for

Method: 使用空间流卷积从轨迹数据提取小尺度特征，识别尺度依赖的空间交互区域，通过图变换器捕获多尺度复杂空间依赖，最后用对比学习算法生成最终表示。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上，MSRFormer在道路网络分析任务中优于基线方法，在复杂道路网络结构中相比最强基线方法提升达16%。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发任务无关的道路网络表示模型提供了实用框架，揭示了尺度效应与空间交互流异质性之间的关联模式。

Abstract: Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep
learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road
networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate
representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from
neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus
on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents
MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that
integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow
heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution
to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies
scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of
road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,
MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple
scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,
which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road
network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that
MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The
performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more
from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in
complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the
most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework
for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights
distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow
heterogeneity of spatial interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注认知层面的修改，缺乏对更深层次元认知过程的关注，需要填补这一空白来评估MLLMs的元认知知识编辑能力。

Method: 提出了MIND框架：构建元知识记忆用于自我意识，使用博弈论交互监控知识激活，并采用标签精炼实现噪声鲁棒更新。

Result: 大量实验表明MIND显著优于现有的认知编辑方法，在传统和元认知知识编辑基准上都取得了强劲性能。

Conclusion: CogEdit基准和MIND框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型的元认知知识编辑能力，为更深层次的知识更新提供了新的评估和方法框架。

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Motivation: 现实世界数据具有高度非欧几里得的层次结构特性，而传统LLMs在处理这类结构时存在局限，需要探索双曲几何作为表示空间来增强语义学习

Method: 提出双曲LLMs的分类框架：1)通过指数/对数映射的双曲LLMs；2)双曲微调模型；3)完全双曲LLMs；4)双曲状态空间模型

Conclusion: 双曲几何为LLMs处理层次结构数据提供了有前景的方向，未来需要在应用拓展和技术优化方面进一步研究

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural
language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding,
text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world
data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein
networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and
linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively
learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from
these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area.
Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures,
hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity
as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across
domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we
provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in
LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance
semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the
paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs
(HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log
maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4)
hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications
and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models,

offering a new approach for multi - agent systems to handle large - scale

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能源管理中的不确定性决策因未知参数而复杂化，传统预测后优化方法存在预测误差传递问题，决策聚焦学习方法虽能整合预测与优化但缺乏实际验证，且现实BESS应用面临数据稀缺和变异性挑战。

Method: 提出AFE-DFL框架，利用自动特征工程提取丰富特征表示，结合决策聚焦学习方法同时进行电价需求预测和BESS运营优化，在真实英国房产数据集上进行验证。

Result: DFL方法平均比PTO方法产生更低运营成本，添加AFE后DFL性能提升22.9-56.5%，证明了DFL在实际场景中的可行性。

Conclusion: 领域特定的自动特征工程增强了决策聚焦学习，减少了对BESS优化领域专业知识的依赖，为面临类似挑战的能源管理系统带来经济效益。

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by
unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat
forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors
to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors
rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning
(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and
optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily
on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their
practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional
challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection
constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work
leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations
and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework
suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while
optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on
a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods
against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL
yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the
performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without
AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in
real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and
reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic
benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar
challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者需要具备必要的医疗知识来积极参与自身护理，但传统方法成本高且难以规模化。研究旨在开发一个低成本、高效的对话AI系统来促进患者教育理解。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先在基于医疗对话策略合成的对话数据上进行监督微调，然后使用PPO强化学习，奖励基于模拟医院出院场景中的患者理解评估。使用轻量级LLaMA 3.2 3B模型和多智能体架构。

Result: NoteAid-Chatbot展现出清晰性、相关性和结构化对话等关键教育行为，尽管没有对这些属性进行显式监督。在图灵测试中超越了非专家人类表现，证明即使简单的PPO奖励建模也能成功训练轻量级领域专用聊天机器人。

Abstract: Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in
their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes
patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built
on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight
LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on
conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation
strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding
assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which
includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates
that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient
education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it
received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that
even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can
successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn
interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced
communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot
surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the
framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying
low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains,
broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有AI代理框架主要针对数学、编程和网页自动化等领域，在地理空间任务中表现不足，需要处理空间推理、多跳规划和实时地图交互等复杂需求。

Method: 采用分层多智能体架构：高层规划器分解复杂查询为子目标，专用模块处理不同类型任务，地图工具代理并行协调相关API，简化模块直接操作无需额外代理开销。

Conclusion: MapAgent通过分层设计和专用工具集有效解决了地理空间推理的挑战，降低了认知负担，提高了工具选择准确性，实现了跨相似API的精确协调。

Abstract: Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most
existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web
automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,
multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,
we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with
customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial
reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools
uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different
geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level
planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to
specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then
design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs
adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the
query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)
operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces
cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise
coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse
geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and
MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented
and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at
https://github.com/Hasebul/MapAgent.

TL;DR: 提出了DRER强化学习奖励框架，通过推理质量奖励和动态长度优势来优化语言模型的推理能力，在Logictree数据集上7B模型达到GPT-3水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于规则的奖励函数只评估答案格式和正确性，无法判断推理链是否真正提升答案质量，且任务特定训练对逻辑深度的控制有限

Method: DRER框架包含：(1)推理质量奖励-为提升正确答案概率的推理链分配细粒度奖励；(2)动态长度优势-对偏离验证阈值的响应长度进行优势衰减

Result: 7B模型在400训练步后达到GPT-3水平，CoT增强答案的平均置信度提升30%，在多种逻辑推理数据集和AIME24数学基准上表现出良好泛化能力

Conclusion: DRER有效塑造了CoT行为，为增强大语言模型的形式推理能力提供了实用路径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for
strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the
rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming
benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to
whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.
Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical
depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We
propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward
framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning
Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that
demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising
the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage
decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a
validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous
assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive
reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a
comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B
model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing
steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The
model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning
datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how
RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing
formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are
available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.

Conclusion: REER范式为开放式创作任务的深度推理提供了新的有效途径，通过逆向工程方法成功解决了传统方法的局限性

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Motivation: 大型推理模型(LRMs)在处理简单问题时容易过度思考，产生冗长复杂的推理轨迹，影响可解释性和效率。研究发现LRMs难以平衡正确性和简洁性等多个生成目标。

Method: 提出EDIT方法：使用约束引导生成，在测试时联合跟踪长度和答案分布，在不同约束条件下选择最优平衡简洁性和正确性的响应。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，EDIT显著提高了推理效率，产生紧凑且信息丰富的输出，改善了可读性和用户体验。

Conclusion: EDIT方法有效解决了LRMs的过度思考问题，通过动态推理修剪实现了推理效率和输出质量的优化平衡。

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

<details>

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型被广泛用于多轮工作流程，但缺乏明确的方法来评估迭代在什么情况下有效或无效

Method: 设计了一个控制评估协议，在思想、代码和数学任务中进行12轮对话，使用从模糊到有针对性的各种提示，并记录每轮输出

Result: 在不同模型和任务中，收益具有领域依赖性：思想和代码在早期就有改善，而数学在后期轮次才有显著进步；模糊反馈容易凝固或造成退步，而有针对性的提示更可靠

Conclusion: 该框架和指标使得迭代变得可量化和可比较，能够指导何时应该迫迹、停止或更换策略，为迭代精细化提供了系统化的评估方法

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we
still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We
present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation,
code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,
utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to
targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with
domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus
reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and
track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement
across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and
tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in
math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,
vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts
reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;
speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and
drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation
moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little
semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,
elaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration
measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or
switch strategies.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了一个稳健、可扩展且自动化的流水线，能够实现从自然语言规范到硅实现的LLM驱动形式验证硬件合成。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal
verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical
domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed
PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that
iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically
steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly
fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis
framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the
generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural
language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's
verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring
Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs
into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)
employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a
challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization
consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by
up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis
success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis
flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for
LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language
specification and silicon realization.

metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization
Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its
performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context

TL;DR: TableMind是一个基于大语言模型的表格推理代理，通过自主工具调用、代码执行和安全沙箱环境，实现精确的数值推理和多步推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本方法在复杂数值计算和细粒度操作上表现不佳，工具集成推理方法缺乏真正的自主适应性，需要更灵活的表格推理解决方案

Method: 采用两阶段微调范式：先在高质量推理轨迹上进行监督微调建立工具使用模式，然后通过强化微调优化多目标策略，提出Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO)方法

Result: 在多个主流基准测试中表现出色，相比竞争基线在推理准确性和计算精度方面都有显著提升

Conclusion: TableMind通过自主工具调用和代码执行能力，结合创新的两阶段微调方法，有效解决了表格推理中的数值计算和自适应策略问题

Abstract: Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as
finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models
(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often
struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations
inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves
computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems
frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true
autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven
table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool
invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox
environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)
exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt
strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool
usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize
multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy
Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality
trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of
low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and
more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to
competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy
and computational precision.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的推理方法依赖隐式探索，导致推理路径不稳定、缺乏错误纠正机制且无法从过往经验中学习，需要更结构化的推理方法

Method: 从成功轨迹中提取结构化推理模式，从失败中获取反思信号；在推理时逐步遵循指导原则，并在每一步后进行细化以纠正错误和稳定推理过程

Conclusion: 结构化推理配合逐步执行和细化显著提升推理质量，指导原则具有良好的跨领域迁移能力，支持跨模型协作，在效果和可扩展性上达到或超过监督微调

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing
strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely
on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided
reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning
paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit
exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we
extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and
reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these
guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct
errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four
additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.
Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability
and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly
support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised
fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

*Lei Shu,Dong Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 大语言模型在住宅能源绿化改造决策中表现有潜力，技术目标下效果更好，但需要提高准确性、一致性和上下文处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 住宅能源绿化改造决策存在普遍性不足和可解释性低的问题，智能连接社区和生成式AI可能通过处理上下文信息来改善这一状况。

Method: 评估7种大语言模型（ChatGPT、DeepSeek、Gemini等）在两种目标下的表现：最大化CO2减排（技术）和最小化回报期限（社会技术），从准确性、一致性、敏感性和推理四个维度进行分析。

Result: LLM在许多情况下能生成有效建议，在无精调情况下顶部1匹配率达54.5%，前5匹配率92.8%。技术目标下表现更好，模型间一致性低，高性能模型偏离其他模型。对位置和建筑形状敏感，对技术和使用者行为不敏感。

Conclusion: 大语言模型是有前景的能源改造决策助手，但需要在准确性、一致性和上下文处理方面进一步改进才能应用于实践。

Abstract: Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision making suffer
from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in
diverse residential contexts. With the growth of Smart and Connected
Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help
by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable
recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok,
Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives:
maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period
(sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy,
consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49
US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up
to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning.
Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical
decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement
across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others.
LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to
technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering
style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual
awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision
making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are
needed for reliable practice.

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM驱动的调查模拟建立了严谨基础，为社会学研究和政策评估提供了可扩展且经济高效的工具。

Abstract: Questionnaire-based surveys are foundational to social science research and
public policymaking, yet traditional survey methods remain costly,
time-consuming, and often limited in scale. This paper explores a new paradigm:
simulating virtual survey respondents using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
introduce two novel simulation settings, namely Partial Attribute Simulation
(PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS), to systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate accurate and demographically coherent responses. In
PAS, the model predicts missing attributes based on partial respondent
profiles, whereas FAS involves generating complete synthetic datasets under
both zero-context and context-enhanced conditions. We curate a comprehensive
benchmark suite, LLM-S^3 (Large Language Model-based Sociodemographic Survey
Simulation), that spans 11 real-world public datasets across four sociological
domains. Our evaluation of multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA
3.0/3.1-8B) reveals consistent trends in prediction performance, highlights
failure modes, and demonstrates how context and prompt design impact simulation
fidelity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey
simulations, offering scalable and cost-effective tools for sociological
research and policy evaluation. Our code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: In online second-hand marketplaces, multi-turn bargaining is a crucial part
of seller-buyer interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as seller
agents, negotiating with buyers on behalf of sellers under given business
constraints. A critical ability for such agents is to track and accurately
interpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which directly
impacts bargaining effectiveness. We introduce a multi-turn evaluation
framework for measuring the bargaining ability of seller agents in e-commerce
dialogues. The framework tests whether an agent can extract and track buyer
intents. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale e-commerce bargaining
benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks; (2) a
turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind (ToM) with annotated
buyer intents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics; and (3) an automated
pipeline that extracts reliable intent from massive dialogue data.

Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must
balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a
novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in
3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level
environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a
testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement

system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired
with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament
data to reconstruct event outcomes. Extensive evaluations show that replays
generated from human data in DECOY closely match those observed in the original

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在处理长上下文任务时面临的'中间信息丢失'问题，现有方法要么可能丢弃关键信息，要么导致注意力分散，需要一种更有效的长文本处理方案。

Method: TOA多智能体推理框架：将输入分段由独立智能体处理，生成局部认知；智能体沿树状结构路径动态交换信息进行协作推理；采用前缀哈希缓存和自适应剪枝策略提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，基于紧凑型LLaMA3.1-8B的TOA显著优于多个基线模型，在多种长上下文任务上达到与最新大型商业模型（如Gemini1.5-pro）相当的性能。

Conclusion: TOA框架通过多智能体协作推理有效缓解位置偏见和减少幻觉，在保持合理API开销的前提下显著提升长文本处理能力，为LLM长上下文任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling
long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where
information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized.
Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key
information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention
dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a
multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed
by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents
dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along
tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders
for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and
reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate
prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant
performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that
TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple
baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger
commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code

Motivation: 集中式RAG系统在处理异构和隐私敏感的医疗数据时面临困难，特别是在分布式医疗环境中，患者数据分布在SQL、知识图谱和临床笔记等多种格式中，且存在隐私约束。

Method: 设计基于Flower的边缘-云协作RAG框架，支持查询结构化SQL数据、半结构化知识图谱和非结构化文档；集成轻量级本地检索器和隐私感知LLM；提供三种匿名化工具；设计三级缓存策略（本地缓存、中间表示缓存和云推理缓存）。

Conclusion: 该框架为结构化异构数据上的RAG提供了一个可扩展且符合隐私要求的解决方案，在敏感和多样化数据环境中释放了LLM的潜力。

Abstract: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive
data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans
SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge
devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient
Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable
and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data,
unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

Abstract: With the growing demand for applying large language models to downstream
tasks, improving model alignment performance and efficiency has become crucial.
Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate
pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key
factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result,
current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the
instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first
investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction
dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth
of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors
determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\% of the model
loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm
to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected
instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to
state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance
at a faster pace and thus achieve \emph{``Accelerated Scaling''}.

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of GUI agents on various platforms like smartphones
and computers, a hybrid paradigm that combines flexible GUI operations with
efficient shortcuts (e.g., API, deep links) is emerging as a promising
direction. However, a framework for systematically benchmarking these hybrid
agents is still underexplored. To take the first step in bridging this gap, we
introduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut
hybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using
predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously
generate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It
features 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base
of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation
metrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can
be significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments
show that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and
efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation
capabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a
foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and
robust intelligent agents.

Abstract: In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple
conflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and
environmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,
such as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in
real-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an

multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to
search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front
of policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of
policies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system
objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.
We also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate
risk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,
showcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed
strategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more
robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply
chains.

TL;DR: BFS-Prover-V2是一个针对LLM自动定理证明的双重扩展系统，通过多轮离线强化学习框架和规划增强的多智能体搜索架构，在训练和推理阶段都实现了扩展突破


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在自动定理证明中面临的双重扩展挑战：训练时强化学习的扩展限制和推理时计算资源的扩展限制

Method: 1) 多轮离线强化学习框架，采用AlphaZero启发的多阶段专家迭代流程，包含自适应策略级数据过滤和定期重训练；2) 规划增强的多智能体搜索架构，使用通用推理模型作为高级规划器分解复杂定理，并行证明智能体通过共享证明缓存协作

Result: 在正式数学基准测试中取得最先进结果：MiniF2F测试集达到95.08%，ProofNet测试集达到41.4%

Conclusion: 该工作提出的强化学习和推理技术不仅适用于形式数学领域，还可应用于其他需要长视野多轮推理和复杂搜索的领域

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem
proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by
challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and
inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system
designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary
innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for
continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This
framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage
expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and
periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail
long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced
multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference
time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level
planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler
subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,
enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by
leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to
scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics
benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F
and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal
mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of
broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon
multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

Abstract: The cycle of scientific discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the slow,
manual creation of software to support computational experiments. To address
this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software
whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language

and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system
achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research
ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated
across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel
methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed
methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that
outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting
COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software
for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series
forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing
novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step
towards accelerating scientific progress.

Motivation: 解决多模态大模型在复杂跨模态推理中存在的"短便"问题和上下文理解不充问题，提高模型的深层推理能力。

Method: 设计了一个即插即用的三模块管道：意图感知器、策略生成器和策略选择器。通过生成和筛选"意图草稿"策略来指导最终推理，无需参数微调，仅通过上下文工程实现跨模型转移。

Result: 在IntentBench、WorldSense和Daily-Omni数据集上验证了方法的通用性和稳健收益。与各自基线相比，完整的"三模块"方案在不同推理引擎和管道组合中均实现一致收益，最高提升约9.51个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法通过信息论分析证明能够降低条件熵并提高信息利用效率，有效抑制意外的短便推理，在零检验场景中具有重要的实践价值和可移植性。

Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"
reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

Motivation: 智能车辆座舱的API代理面临紧密耦合子系统的协调挑战，传统函数调用方法需要多次探索性调用来建立环境感知，导致效率低下和错误恢复能力有限。

Method: 开发了VehicleWorld环境，包含30个模块、250个API和680个属性，支持实时状态信息。基于状态预测优于函数调用的发现，提出了State-based Function Call (SFC)方法，维护显式系统状态感知并实现直接状态转换。

Result: 实验结果表明SFC显著优于传统FC方法，在执行准确性和延迟方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: SFC方法为车载环境中的API代理提供了更高效的解决方案，所有实现代码已在Github上公开。

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on
Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.

Motivation: 当前的长时程多组件LLM代理系统评估方法存在局限，主要关注单一指标或端到端结果，难以识别系统在何处以及为何出现故障。需要能够推理、探测、迭代和理解复杂逻辑的评估框架。

Method: RAFFLES采用迭代式多组件流水线架构，包含一个中央Judge系统性地调查故障，以及一组专门的Evaluators评估系统组件和Judge自身的推理质量，建立假设历史记录。

Result: 在Who&When数据集上，RAFFLES在算法生成数据集上达到43%以上的代理-步骤故障对准确率（相比之前最佳16.6%大幅提升），在手工制作数据集上达到20%以上（超越之前最佳8.8%）。

Conclusion: RAFFLES展示了向自主系统引入自动化故障检测的重要进展，相比劳动密集型人工审查具有显著优势，为长时程多组件LLM代理系统的评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

Motivation: 评估测试时扩居技术在知识密集任务中的效果，对比其在其他领域的优异表现

Method: 使用12个推理模型在2个知识密集测试集上进行综合评测，分析扩展推理对幻觉现象的影响

Result: 增加测试时计算并不能持续提高准确率，反而在许多情况下会导致更多幻觉；扩展推理导致模型更多选择放弃回答，而非改善事实记忆

Conclusion: 虽然有限制，但启用思考仍比不思考更有益；扩展推理可能引发确认偏见，导致过于自信的幻觉

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

Conclusion: Paper2Agent将静态论文转化为动态AI代理，为知识传播和AI协作生态系统奠定了新范式基础。

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own
work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this
challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into
dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for
knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI
co-scientists.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多步去噪的计算效率问题和奖励模型离线调整的依赖，显著提升了模型的输出质量

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning
diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However,
they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with
gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,
thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often
need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired
aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address
the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that
predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time
steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are
interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids
over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic
Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as
text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in
response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the
reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model
with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its
human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.
